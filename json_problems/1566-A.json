Find the maximum possible median of an array of $$$n$$$non-negativeintegers (not necessarily distinct), such that the sum of its elements is equal to $$$s$$$.Amedianof an array of integers of length $$$m$$$ is the number standing on the $$$\\\\lceil {\\\\frac{m}{2}} \\\\rceil$$$-th (rounding up) position in the non-decreasing ordering of its elements. Positions are numbered starting from $$$1$$$. For example, a median of the array $$$[20,40,20,50,50,30]$$$ is the $$$\\\\lceil \\\\frac{m}{2} \\\\rceil$$$-th element of $$$[20,20,30,40,50,50]$$$, so it is $$$30$$$. There exist other definitions of the median, but in this problem we use the described definition.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.Each test case contains a single line with two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, s \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array and the required sum of the elements.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the maximum possible median.ExampleInput8 1 5 2 5 3 5 2 1 7 17 4 14 1 1000000000 1000000000 1Output5 2 2 0 4 4 1000000000 0NotePossible arrays for the first three test cases (in each array the median is underlined):In the first test case $$$[\\\\underline{5}]$$$In the second test case $$$[\\\\underline{2}, 3]$$$In the third test case $$$[1, \\\\underline{2}, 2]$$$",
