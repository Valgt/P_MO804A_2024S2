Water the Treestime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ trees in a park, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The initial height of the $$$i$$$-th tree is $$$h_i$$$.You want to water these trees, so they all grow to thesameheight.The watering process goes as follows. You start watering trees at day $$$1$$$. During the $$$j$$$-th day you can:Choose a tree and water it. If the day is odd (e.g. $$$1, 3, 5, 7, \\\\dots$$$), then the height of the tree increases by $$$1$$$. If the day is even (e.g. $$$2, 4, 6, 8, \\\\dots$$$), then the height of the tree increases by $$$2$$$.Or skip a day without watering any tree.Note that you can't water more than one tree in a day.Your task is to determine theminimumnumber of days required to water the trees so they grow to the same height.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of trees.The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\\\ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le h_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$h_i$$$ is the height of the $$$i$$$-th tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — theminimumnumber of days required to water the trees, so they grow to the same height.ExampleInput331 2 454 4 3 5 572 5 4 8 3 7 4Output4 3 16NoteConsider the first test case of the example. The initial state of the trees is $$$[1, 2, 4]$$$.During the first day, let's water the first tree, so the sequence of heights becomes $$$[2, 2, 4]$$$;during the second day, let's water the second tree, so the sequence of heights becomes $$$[2, 4, 4]$$$;let's skip the third day;during the fourth day, let's water the first tree, so the sequence of heights becomes $$$[4, 4, 4]$$$.Thus, the answer is $$$4$$$.",
