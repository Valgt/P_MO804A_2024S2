Robot Vacuum Cleanertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPushok the dog has been chasing Imp for a few hours already.Fortunately, Imp knows that Pushok is afraid of a robot vacuum cleaner.While moving, the robot generates a stringtconsisting of letters 's' and 'h', that produces a lot of noise. We definenoiseof stringtas the number of occurrences of string \"sh\" as asubsequencein it, in other words, the number of such pairs(i,j), thati<jandand.The robot is off at the moment. Imp knows that it has a sequence of stringstiin its memory, and he can arbitrary change their order. When the robot is started, it generates the stringtas a concatenation of these strings in the given order. The noise of the resulting string equals the noise of this concatenation.Help Imp to find the maximum noise he can achieve by changing the order of the strings.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 105) — the number of strings in robot's memory.Nextnlines contain the stringst1,t2, ...,tn, one per line. It is guaranteed that the strings are non-empty, contain only English letters 's' and 'h' and their total length does not exceed105.OutputPrint a single integer — the maxumum possiblenoiseImp can achieve by changing the order of the strings.ExamplesInput4sshhsshhhsOutput18Input2hsOutput1NoteThe optimal concatenation in the first sample isssshhshhhs.",
