Cyclic Coloringtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYou are given adirectedgraphGwithnvertices andmarcs (multiple arcs and self-loopsare allowed). You have to paint each vertex of the graph into one of thek(k≤n)colors in such way that for all arcs of the graph leading from a vertexuto vertexv, vertexvis painted with thenext colorof the color used to paint vertexu.The colors are numbered cyclically1throughk. This means that for each colori(i<k)its next color is colori+ 1. In addition, the next color of colorkis color1. Note, that ifk= 1, then the next color for color1is again color1.Your task is to find and print the largest possible value ofk(k≤n)such that it's possible to colorGas described above withkcolors. Note that you don't necessarily use all thekcolors (that is, for each colorithere does not necessarily exist a vertex that is colored with colori).InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 105), denoting the number of vertices and the number of arcs of the given digraph, respectively.Thenmlines follow, each line will contain two space-separated integersaiandbi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n), which means that thei-th arc goes from vertexaito vertexbi.Multiple arcs and self-loops are allowed.OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum possible number of the colors that can be used to paint the digraph (i.e.k, as described in the problem statement).
