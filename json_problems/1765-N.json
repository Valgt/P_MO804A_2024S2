Number Reductiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a positive integer $$$x$$$.You can apply the following operation to the number: remove one occurrence of any digit in such a way that the resulting numberdoes not contain any leading zeroesandis still a positive integer. For example, $$$10142$$$ can be converted to $$$1142$$$, $$$1042$$$, $$$1012$$$ or $$$1014$$$ (note that $$$0142$$$ is not a valid outcome); $$$10$$$ can be converted to $$$1$$$ (but not to $$$0$$$ since it is not positive).Your task is to find the minimum positive integer that you can obtain from $$$x$$$ if you can apply the aforementioned operation exactly $$$k$$$ times.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x < 10^{500000}$$$).The second line contains a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le k < |x|$$$), where $$$|x|$$$ is the length of the number $$$x$$$.The sum of $$$|x|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum positive number that you can obtain from $$$x$$$ if you can apply the operation exactly $$$k$$$ times.ExampleInput510000413370987654321666837494128578086523Output1 1337 321 344128 7052",
