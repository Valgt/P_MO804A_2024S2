To My Criticstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSuneet has three digits $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$.Since math isn't his strongest point, he asks you to determine if you can choose any two digits to make a sum greater or equal to $$$10$$$.Output \"YES\" if there is such a pair, and \"NO\" otherwise.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains three digits $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a, b, c \\\\leq 9$$$).OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" if such a pair exists, and \"NO\" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput58 1 24 4 59 9 90 0 08 5 3OutputYES NO YES NO YESNoteFor the first test case, by choosing the digits $$$8$$$ and $$$2$$$ we can obtain a sum of $$$8 + 2 = 10$$$ which satisfies the condition, thus the output should be \"YES\".For the second test case, any combination of chosen digits won't be at least $$$10$$$, thus the output should be \"NO\" (note that we can not choose the digit on the same position twice).For the third test case, any combination of chosen digits will have a sum equal to $$$18$$$, thus the output should be \"YES\".",
