Valera and Fruitstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutValera loves his garden, wherenfruit trees grow.This year he will enjoy a great harvest! On thei-th treebifruit grow, they will ripen on a day numberai. Unfortunately, the fruit on the tree get withered, so they can only be collected on dayaiand dayai+ 1(all fruits that are not collected in these two days, become unfit to eat).Valera is not very fast, but there are some positive points. Valera is ready to work every day. In one day, Valera can collect no more thanvfruits. The fruits may be either from the same tree, or from different ones. What is the maximum amount of fruit Valera can collect for all time, if he operates optimally well?InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandv(1 ≤n,v≤ 3000)— the number of fruit trees in the garden and the number of fruits that Valera can collect in a day.Nextnlines contain the description of trees in the garden. Thei-th line contains two space-separated integersaiandbi(1 ≤ai,bi≤ 3000)— the day the fruits ripen on thei-th tree and the number of fruits on thei-th tree.OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum number of fruit that Valera can collect.ExamplesInput2 31 52 3Output8Input5 103 202 201 204 205 20Output60NoteIn the first sample, in order to obtain the optimal answer, you should act as follows.On the first day collect3fruits from the1-st tree.On the second day collect1fruit from the2-nd tree and2fruits from the1-st tree.On the third day collect the remaining fruits from the2-nd tree.In the second sample, you can only collect60fruits, the remaining fruit will simply wither.",
