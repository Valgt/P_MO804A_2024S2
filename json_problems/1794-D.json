Counting Factorizationstime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe prime factorization of a positive integer $$$m$$$ is the unique way to write it as $$$\\\\displaystyle m=p_1^{e_1}\\\\cdot p_2^{e_2}\\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k^{e_k}$$$, where $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$$$ are prime numbers, $$$p_1 < p_2 < \\\\ldots < p_k$$$ and $$$e_1, e_2, \\\\ldots, e_k$$$ are positive integers.For each positive integer $$$m$$$, $$$f(m)$$$ is defined as the multiset of all numbers in its prime factorization, that is $$$f(m)=\\\\{p_1,e_1,p_2,e_2,\\\\ldots,p_k,e_k\\\\}$$$.For example, $$$f(24)=\\\\{2,3,3,1\\\\}$$$, $$$f(5)=\\\\{1,5\\\\}$$$ and $$$f(1)=\\\\{\\\\}$$$.You are given a list consisting of $$$2n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{2n}$$$. Count how many positive integers $$$m$$$ satisfy that $$$f(m)=\\\\{a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{2n}\\\\}$$$. Since this value may be large, print it modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n \\\\le 2022$$$).The second line contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{2n}$$$ ($$$1\\\\le a_i\\\\le 10^6$$$)  — the given list.OutputPrint one integer, the number of positive integers $$$m$$$ satisfying $$$f(m)=\\\\{a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{2n}\\\\}$$$ modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.ExamplesInput2 1 3 2 3Output2Input2 2 2 3 5Output5Input1 1 4Output0NoteIn the first sample, the two values of $$$m$$$ such that $$$f(m)=\\\\{1,2,3,3\\\\}$$$ are $$$m=24$$$ and $$$m=54$$$. Their prime factorizations are $$$24=2^3\\\\cdot 3^1$$$ and $$$54=2^1\\\\cdot 3^3$$$.In the second sample, the five values of $$$m$$$ such that $$$f(m)=\\\\{2,2,3,5\\\\}$$$ are $$$200, 225, 288, 500$$$ and $$$972$$$.In the third sample, there is no value of $$$m$$$ such that $$$f(m)=\\\\{1,4\\\\}$$$. Neither $$$1^4$$$ nor $$$4^1$$$ are prime factorizations because $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ arenotprimes.",
