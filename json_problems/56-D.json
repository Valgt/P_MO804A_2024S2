Let's denote its current length as|s|. During one move it is allowed to apply one of the following operations to it:INSERTposch— insert a letterchin the stringsin the positionpos(1 ≤pos≤ |s| + 1,A≤ch≤Z). The letterchbecomes thepos-th symbol of the strings, at that the letters shift aside and the length of the string increases by 1.DELETEpos— delete a character numberpos(1 ≤pos≤ |s|) from the strings. At that the letters shift together and the length of the string decreases by 1.REPLACEposch— the letter in the positionposof the linesis replaced bych(1 ≤pos≤ |s|,A≤ch≤Z). At that the length of the string does not change.Your task is to find in which minimal number of moves one can get atstring from ansstring. You should also find the sequence of actions leading to the required results.InputThe first line containss, the second line containst. The lines consist only of capital Latin letters, their lengths are positive numbers from1to1000.OutputIn the first line print the number of moveskin the given sequence of operations. The number should be the minimal possible one. Then printklines containing one operation each. Print the operations in the format, described above. If there are several solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInputABAABBBAOutput2INSERT 3 BINSERT 4 BInputACCEPTEDWRONGANSWEROutput10REPLACE 1 WREPLACE 2 RREPLACE 3 OREPLACE 4 NREPLACE 5 GREPLACE 6 AINSERT 7 NINSERT 8 SINSERT 9 WREPLACE 11 R",
