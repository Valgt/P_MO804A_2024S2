However, each plane on Earth likes some other plane. There arenplanes on Earth, numbered from1ton, and the plane with numberilikes the plane with numberfi, where1 ≤fi≤nandfi≠i.We call a love triangle a situation in which planeAlikes planeB, planeBlikes planeCand planeClikes planeA. Find out if there is any love triangle on Earth.InputThe first line contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 5000) — the number of planes.The second line containsnintegersf1,f2, ...,fn(1 ≤fi≤n,fi≠i), meaning that thei-th plane likes thefi-th.OutputOutput «YES» if there is a love triangle consisting of planes on Earth. Otherwise, output «NO».You can output any letter in lower case or in upper case.ExamplesInput52 4 5 1 3OutputYESInput55 5 5 5 1OutputNONoteIn first example plane2likes plane4, plane4likes plane1, plane1likes plane2and that is a love triangle.In second example there are no love triangles.",
