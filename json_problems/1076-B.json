The following algorithm is applied to it:if $$$n = 0$$$, then end algorithm;find the smallestprimedivisor $$$d$$$ of $$$n$$$;subtract $$$d$$$ from $$$n$$$ and go to step $$$1$$$.Determine the number of subtrations the algorithm will make.InputThe only line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{10}$$$).OutputPrint a single integer â€” the number of subtractions the algorithm will make.ExamplesInput5Output1Input4Output2NoteIn the first example $$$5$$$ is the smallest prime divisor, thus it gets subtracted right away to make a $$$0$$$.In the second example $$$2$$$ is the smallest prime divisor at both steps.",
