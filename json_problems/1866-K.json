Keen Tree Calculationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a tree of $$$N$$$ vertices and $$$N-1$$$ edges. The $$$i$$$-th edge connects vertices $$$U_i$$$ and $$$V_i$$$ and has a length of $$$W_i$$$.Chaneka, the owner of the tree, asks you $$$Q$$$ times. For the $$$j$$$-th question, the following is the question format:$$$X_j$$$ $$$K_j$$$ – If each edge that contains vertex $$$X_j$$$ has its length multiplied by $$$K_j$$$, what is the diameter of the tree?Notes:Each of Chaneka's question isindependent, which means the changes in edge length do not influence the next questions.The diameter of a tree is the maximum possible distance between two different vertices in the tree.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$N$$$ ($$$2\\\\leq N\\\\leq10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$N-1$$$ lines contains three integers $$$U_i$$$, $$$V_i$$$, and $$$W_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq U_i,V_i \\\\leq N$$$; $$$1\\\\leq W_i\\\\leq10^9$$$) — an edge that connects vertices $$$U_i$$$ and $$$V_i$$$ with a length of $$$W_i$$$. The edges form a tree.The $$$(N+1)$$$-th line contains a single integer $$$Q$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq Q\\\\leq10^5$$$) — the number of questions.The $$$j$$$-th of the next $$$Q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$X_j$$$ and $$$K_j$$$ as described ($$$1 \\\\leq X_j \\\\leq N$$$; $$$1 \\\\leq K_j \\\\leq 10^9$$$).OutputOutput $$$Q$$$ lines with an integer in each line. The integer in the $$$j$$$-th line represents the diameter of the tree on the $$$j$$$-th question.ExamplesInput7 5 1 2 1 4 2 3 4 1 2 5 3 6 1 6 4 7 2 2 4 3 3 2Output18 11Input3 1 2 1000000000 2 3 1000000000 1 2 1000000000Output2000000000000000000NoteIn the first example, the following is the tree without any changes.The following is the tree on the $$$1$$$-st question.The maximum distance is between vertices $$$6$$$ and $$$7$$$, which is $$$6+6+6=18$$$, so the diameter is $$$18$$$.The following is the tree on the $$$2$$$-nd question.The maximum distance is between vertices $$$2$$$ and $$$6$$$, which is $$$3+2+6=11$$$, so the diameter is $$$11$$$.",
