Graph Coloringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an undirected graph without self-loops or multiple edges which consists of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. Also you are given three integers $$$n_1$$$, $$$n_2$$$ and $$$n_3$$$.Can you label each vertex with one of three numbers1,2or3in such way, that:Each vertex should be labeled by exactly one number1,2or3;The total number of vertices with label1should be equal to $$$n_1$$$;The total number of vertices with label2should be equal to $$$n_2$$$;The total number of vertices with label3should be equal to $$$n_3$$$;$$$|col_u - col_v| = 1$$$ for each edge $$$(u, v)$$$, where $$$col_x$$$ is the label of vertex $$$x$$$.If there are multiple valid labelings, print any of them.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5000$$$; $$$0 \\\\le m \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.The second line contains three integers $$$n_1$$$, $$$n_2$$$ and $$$n_3$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le n_1, n_2, n_3 \\\\le n$$$) — the number of labels1,2and3, respectively. It's guaranteed that $$$n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = n$$$.Next $$$m$$$ lines contan description of edges: the $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u_i, v_i \\\\le n$$$; $$$u_i \\\\neq v_i$$$) — the vertices the $$$i$$$-th edge connects. It's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain self-loops or multiple edges.OutputIf valid labeling exists then print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print string of length $$$n$$$ consisting of1,2and3. The $$$i$$$-th letter should be equal to the label of the $$$i$$$-th vertex.If there is no valid labeling, print \"NO\" (without quotes).ExamplesInput6 3 2 2 2 3 1 5 4 2 5OutputYES 112323Input5 9 0 2 3 1 2 1 3 1 5 2 3 2 4 2 5 3 4 3 5 4 5OutputNO",
