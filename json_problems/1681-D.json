You may perform several operations with the integer $$$x$$$.Each operation you perform is the following one: choose any digit $$$y$$$ that occurs in the decimal representation of $$$x$$$ at least once, and replace $$$x$$$ by $$$x \\\\cdot y$$$.You want to make the length of decimal representation of $$$x$$$ (without leading zeroes) equal to $$$n$$$. What is the minimum number of operations required to do that?InputThe only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 19$$$; $$$1 \\\\le x < 10^{n-1}$$$).OutputPrint one integer â€” the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of $$$x$$$ (without leading zeroes) equal to $$$n$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.ExamplesInput2 1Output-1Input3 2Output4Input13 42Output12NoteIn the second example, the following sequence of operations achieves the goal:multiply $$$x$$$ by $$$2$$$, so $$$x = 2 \\\\cdot 2 = 4$$$;multiply $$$x$$$ by $$$4$$$, so $$$x = 4 \\\\cdot 4 = 16$$$;multiply $$$x$$$ by $$$6$$$, so $$$x = 16 \\\\cdot 6 = 96$$$;multiply $$$x$$$ by $$$9$$$, so $$$x = 96 \\\\cdot 9 = 864$$$.",
