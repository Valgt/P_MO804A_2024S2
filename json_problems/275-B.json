Lenny has painted some of the cells (at least one) black. We call a painted gridconvexif one can walk fromanyblack cell toany anotherblack cell using a path of side-adjacent black cells changing his direction at most once during the path. In the figure below, the left grid is convex while the right one is not convex, because there exist two cells which need more than one time to change direction in their path.You're given a painted grid in the input. Tell Lenny if the grid is convex or not.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 50)— the size of the grid. Each of the nextnlines containsmcharacters \"B\" or \"W\". Character \"B\" denotes a black cell of the grid and \"W\" denotes a white cell of the grid.It's guaranteed that the grid has at least one black cell.OutputOn the only line of the output print \"YES\" if the grid is convex, otherwise print \"NO\".
