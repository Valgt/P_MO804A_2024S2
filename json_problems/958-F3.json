Several thousand solar systems had declared their intentions to leave the Republic. But fear not! Master Heidi was able to successfully select the Jedi Knights that have restored peace in the galaxy. However, she knows that evil never sleeps and a time may come when she will need to pick another group of Jedi Knights. She wants to be sure she has enough options to do so.There arenJedi Knights, each of them with a lightsaber of one ofmcolors. Given a numberk, compute the number of differently colored collections ofklightsabers that somekJedi Knights might have. Jedi Knights with lightsabers of the same color are indistinguishable (it's not the person, it's the lightsaber color that matters!), and their order does not matter; that is, we consider two collections of Jedi Knights to be different if and only if their vectors of counts of lightsabers of each color (like what you were given in the easy and the medium versions) are different. We count all subsets, not only contiguous subsegments of the input sequence. Output the answer modulo1009.InputThe first line of the input containsn(1 ≤n≤ 2·105),m(1 ≤m≤n) andk(1 ≤k≤n). The second line containsnintegers in the range{1, 2, ...,m}representing colors of the lightsabers of subsequent Jedi Knights.OutputOutput one number: the number of differently colored collections ofklightsabers modulo1009.ExampleInput4 3 21 2 3 2Output4",
