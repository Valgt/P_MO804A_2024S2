Recover it!time limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAuthors guessed an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers; each integer is not less than $$$2$$$ and not greater than $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$. You don't know the array $$$a$$$, but you know the array $$$b$$$ which is formed from it with the following sequence of operations:Firstly, let the array $$$b$$$ be equal to the array $$$a$$$;Secondly, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$:if $$$a_i$$$ is aprimenumber, then one integer $$$p_{a_i}$$$ is appended to array $$$b$$$, where $$$p$$$ is an infinite sequence of prime numbers ($$$2, 3, 5, \\\\dots$$$);otherwise (if $$$a_i$$$ is not aprimenumber), the greatest divisor of $$$a_i$$$ which is not equal to $$$a_i$$$ is appended to $$$b$$$;Then the obtained array of length $$$2n$$$ is shuffled and given to you in the input.Here $$$p_{a_i}$$$ means the $$$a_i$$$-th prime number. The first prime $$$p_1 = 2$$$, the second one is $$$p_2 = 3$$$, and so on.Your task is to recoveranysuitable array $$$a$$$ that forms the given array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the answer exists (so the array $$$b$$$ is obtained from some suitable array $$$a$$$). If there are multiple answers, you can print any.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_{2n}$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 2750131$$$), where $$$b_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$b$$$. $$$2750131$$$ is the $$$199999$$$-th prime number.OutputIn the only line of the output print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) inanyorder — the array $$$a$$$ from which the array $$$b$$$ can be obtained using the sequence of moves given in the problem statement. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.ExamplesInput3 3 5 2 3 2 4Output3 4 2Input1 2750131 199999Output199999Input1 3 6Output6",
