Bear and Big Brothertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.Right now, Limak and Bob weighaandbrespectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?InputThe only line of the input contains two integersaandb(1 ≤a≤b≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.OutputPrint one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.ExamplesInput4 7Output2Input4 9Output3Input1 1Output1NoteIn the first sample, Limak weighs4and Bob weighs7initially. After one year their weights are4·3 = 12and7·2 = 14respectively (one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are36and28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print2.In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are:12and18, then36and36, and finally108and72(after three years). The answer is3. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be3and2then.",
