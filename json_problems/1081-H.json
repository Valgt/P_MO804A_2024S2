Palindromic Magictime limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAfter learning some fancy algorithms about palindromes, Chouti found palindromes very interesting, so he wants to challenge you with this problem.Chouti has got two strings $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$. Since he likespalindromes, he would like to pick $$$a$$$ as some non-empty palindromic substring of $$$A$$$ and $$$b$$$ as some non-empty palindromic substring of $$$B$$$. Concatenating them, he will get string $$$ab$$$.Chouti thinks strings he could get this way are interesting, so he wants to know how many different strings he can get.InputThe first line contains a single string $$$A$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |A| \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains a single string $$$B$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |B| \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).Strings $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ contain only lowercase English letters.OutputThe first and only line should contain a single integer — the number of possible strings.ExamplesInputaaabaOutput6InputaabaabaaOutput15NoteIn the first example, attainable strings are\"a\" + \"a\" = \"aa\",\"aa\" + \"a\" = \"aaa\",\"aa\" + \"aba\" = \"aaaba\",\"aa\" + \"b\" = \"aab\",\"a\" + \"aba\" = \"aaba\",\"a\" + \"b\" = \"ab\".In the second example, attainable strings are \"aa\", \"aaa\", \"aaaa\", \"aaaba\", \"aab\", \"aaba\", \"ab\", \"abaa\", \"abaaa\", \"abaaba\", \"abab\", \"ba\", \"baa\", \"baba\", \"bb\".Notice that though \"a\"+\"aa\"=\"aa\"+\"a\"=\"aaa\", \"aaa\" will only be counted once.",
