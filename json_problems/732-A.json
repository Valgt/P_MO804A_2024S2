    "statement": "A. Buy a Shoveltime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp urgently needs a shovel! He comes to the shop and chooses an appropriate one. The shovel that Policarp chooses is sold forkburles. Assume that there is an unlimited number of such shovels in the shop.In his pocket Polycarp has an unlimited number of \"10-burle coins\" and exactly one coin ofrburles (1 ≤r≤ 9).What is the minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy so that he can pay for the purchase without any change? It is obvious that he can pay for 10 shovels without any change (by paying the requied amount of 10-burle coins and not using the coin ofrburles). But perhaps he can buy fewer shovels and pay without any change. Note that Polycarp should buy at least one shovel.InputThe single line of input contains two integerskandr(1 ≤k≤ 1000,1 ≤r≤ 9) — the price of one shovel and the denomination of the coin in Polycarp's pocket that is different from \"10-burle coins\".Remember that he has an unlimited number of coins in the denomination of 10, that is, Polycarp has enough money to buy any number of shovels.OutputPrint the required minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy so that he can pay for them without any change.ExamplesInput117 3Output9Input237 7Output1Input15 2Output2NoteIn the first example Polycarp can buy 9 shovels and pay9·117 = 1053burles. Indeed, he can pay this sum by using 10-burle coins and one 3-burle coin. He can't buy fewer shovels without any change.In the second example it is enough for Polycarp to buy one shovel.In the third example Polycarp should buy two shovels and pay2·15 = 30burles. It is obvious that he can pay this sum without any change.",
