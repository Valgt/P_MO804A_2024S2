New Year and Conferencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFilled with optimism, Hyunuk will host a conference about how great this new year will be!The conference will have $$$n$$$ lectures. Hyunuk has two candidate venues $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. For each of the $$$n$$$ lectures, the speaker specified two time intervals $$$[sa_i, ea_i]$$$ ($$$sa_i \\\\le ea_i$$$) and $$$[sb_i, eb_i]$$$ ($$$sb_i \\\\le eb_i$$$). If the conference is situated in venue $$$a$$$, the lecture will be held from $$$sa_i$$$ to $$$ea_i$$$, and if the conference is situated in venue $$$b$$$, the lecture will be held from $$$sb_i$$$ to $$$eb_i$$$. Hyunuk will choose one of these venues andalllectures will be held at that venue.Two lectures are said to overlap if they share any point in time in common. Formally, a lecture held in interval $$$[x, y]$$$ overlaps with a lecture held in interval $$$[u, v]$$$ if and only if $$$\\\\max(x, u) \\\\le \\\\min(y, v)$$$.We say that a participant canattenda subset $$$s$$$ of the lectures if the lectures in $$$s$$$ do not pairwise overlap (i.e. no two lectures overlap). Note that the possibility of attending may depend on whether Hyunuk selected venue $$$a$$$ or venue $$$b$$$ to hold the conference.A subset of lectures $$$s$$$ is said to bevenue-sensitiveif, for one of the venues, the participant can attend $$$s$$$, but for the other venue, the participant cannot attend $$$s$$$.A venue-sensitive set is problematic for a participant who is interested in attending the lectures in $$$s$$$ because the participant cannot be sure whether the lecture times will overlap. Hyunuk will be happy if and only if there are no venue-sensitive sets. Determine whether Hyunuk will be happy.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$), the number of lectures held in the conference.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains four integers $$$sa_i$$$, $$$ea_i$$$, $$$sb_i$$$, $$$eb_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le sa_i, ea_i, sb_i, eb_i \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$sa_i \\\\le ea_i, sb_i \\\\le eb_i$$$).OutputPrint \"YES\" if Hyunuk will be happy. Print \"NO\" otherwise.You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).ExamplesInput2 1 2 3 6 3 4 7 8OutputYESInput3 1 3 2 4 4 5 6 7 3 4 5 5OutputNOInput6 1 5 2 9 2 4 5 8 3 6 7 11 7 10 12 16 8 11 13 17 9 12 14 18OutputYESNoteIn second example, lecture set $$$\\\\{1, 3\\\\}$$$ is venue-sensitive. Because participant can't attend this lectures in venue $$$a$$$, but can attend in venue $$$b$$$.In first and third example, venue-sensitive set does not exist.",
