Tavas and Pashmakstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTavas is a cheerleader in the new sports competition named \"Pashmaks\".This competition consists of two part: swimming and then running. People will immediately start runningRmeters after they finished swimming exactlySmeters. A winner is a such person that nobody else finishes running before him/her (there may be more than one winner).Before the match starts, Tavas knows that there arencompetitors registered for the match. Also, he knows thati-th person's swimming speed issimeters per second and his/her running speed isrimeters per second. Unfortunately, he doesn't know the values ofRandS, but he knows that they are real numbers greater than0.As a cheerleader, Tavas wants to know who to cheer up. So, he wants to know all people that might win. We consider a competitor might win if and only if there are some values ofRandSsuch that with these values, (s)he will be a winner.Tavas isn't really familiar with programming, so he asked you to help him.InputThe first line of input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 2 × 105).The nextnlines contain the details of competitors.i-th line contains two integerssiandri(1 ≤si,ri≤ 104).OutputIn the first and the only line of output, print a sequence of numbers of possible winners in increasing order.ExamplesInput31 32 23 1Output1 2 3Input31 21 12 1Output1 3",
