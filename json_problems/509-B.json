Your task is to paint each pebble using one of thekgiven colors so that for each colorcand any two pilesiandjthe difference between the number of pebbles of colorcin pileiand number of pebbles of colorcin pilejis at most one.In other words, let's say thatbi,cis the number of pebbles of colorcin thei-th pile. Then for any1 ≤c≤k,1 ≤i,j≤nthe following condition must be satisfied|bi,c-bj,c| ≤ 1. It isn't necessary to use allkcolors: if colorchasn't been used in pilei, thenbi,cis considered to be zero.InputThe first line of the input contains positive integersnandk(1 ≤n,k≤ 100), separated by a space — the number of piles and the number of colors respectively.The second line containsnpositive integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 100) denoting number of pebbles in each of the piles.OutputIf there is no way to paint the pebbles satisfying the given condition, output \"NO\" (without quotes) .Otherwise in the first line output \"YES\" (without quotes). Thennlines should follow, thei-th of them should containaispace-separated integers.j-th (1 ≤j≤ai) of these integers should be equal to the color of thej-th pebble in thei-th pile.If there are several possible answers, you may output any of them.ExamplesInput4 41 2 3 4OutputYES11 41 2 41 2 3 4Input5 23 2 4 1 3OutputNOInput5 43 2 4 3 5OutputYES1 2 31 31 2 3 41 3 41 1 2 3 4",
