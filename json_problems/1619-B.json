Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$8$$$, $$$9$$$, ....For a given number $$$n$$$, count the number of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such $$$x$$$ that $$$x$$$ is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously).InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 20$$$) — the number of test cases.Then $$$t$$$ lines contain the test cases, one per line. Each of the lines contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer you are looking for — the number of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ that Polycarp likes.ExampleInput6 10 1 25 1000000000 999999999 500000000Output4 1 6 32591 32590 23125",
