Paths and Treestime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLittle girl Susie accidentally found her elder brother's notebook. She has many things to do, more important than solving problems, but she found this problem too interesting, so she wanted to know its solution and decided to ask you about it. So, the problem statement is as follows.Let's assume that we are given aconnectedweighted undirected graphG= (V,E)(hereVis the set of vertices,Eis the set of edges). The shortest-path tree from vertexuis such graphG1= (V,E1)that is a tree with the set of edgesE1that is the subset of the set of edges of the initial graphE, and the lengths of the shortest paths fromuto any vertex toGand toG1are the same.You are given aconnectedweighted undirected graphGand vertexu. Your task is to find the shortest-path tree of the given graph from vertexu, the total weight of whose edges is minimum possible.InputThe first line contains two numbers,nandm(1 ≤n≤ 3·105,0 ≤m≤ 3·105) — the number of vertices and edges of the graph, respectively.Nextmlines contain three integers each, representing an edge —ui,vi,wi— the numbers of vertices connected by an edge and the weight of the edge (ui≠vi, 1 ≤wi≤ 109). It is guaranteed that graph is connected and thatthere is no more than one edge between any pair of vertices.The last line of the input contains integeru(1 ≤u≤n) — the number of the start vertex.OutputIn the first line print the minimum total weight of the edges of the tree.In the next line print the indices of the edges that are included in the tree, separated by spaces. The edges are numbered starting from1in the order they follow in the input. You may print the numbers of the edges in any order.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput3 31 2 12 3 11 3 23Output21 2Input4 41 2 12 3 13 4 14 1 24Output42 3 4NoteIn the first sample there are two possible shortest path trees:with edges1 – 3and2 – 3(the total weight is3);with edges1 – 2and2 – 3(the total weight is2);And, for example, a tree with edges1 – 2and1 – 3won't be a shortest path tree for vertex3, because the distance from vertex3to vertex2in this tree equals3, and in the original graph it is1.",
