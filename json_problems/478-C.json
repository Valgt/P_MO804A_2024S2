To decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons. Three balloons attached to some table shouldn't have the same color. What maximum numbertof tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color?Your task is to write a program that for given valuesr,gandbwill find the maximum numbertof tables, that can be decorated in the required manner.InputThe single line contains three integersr,gandb(0 ≤r,g,b≤ 2·109) — the number of red, green and blue baloons respectively. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.OutputPrint a single integert— the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner.ExamplesInput5 4 3Output4Input1 1 1Output1Input2 3 3Output2NoteIn the first sample you can decorate the tables with the following balloon sets: \"rgg\", \"gbb\", \"brr\", \"rrg\", where \"r\", \"g\" and \"b\" represent the red, green and blue balls, respectively.",
