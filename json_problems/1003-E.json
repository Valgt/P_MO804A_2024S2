Tree Constructingtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three integers $$$n$$$, $$$d$$$ and $$$k$$$.Your task is to construct an undirected tree on $$$n$$$ vertices with diameter $$$d$$$ and degree of each vertex at most $$$k$$$, or say that it is impossible.An undirected tree is a connected undirected graph with $$$n - 1$$$ edges.Diameter of a tree is the maximum length of a simple path (a path in which each vertex appears at most once) between all pairs of vertices of this tree.Degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to this vertex (i.e. for a vertex $$$u$$$ it is the number of edges $$$(u, v)$$$ that belong to the tree, where $$$v$$$ is any other vertex of a tree).InputThe first line of the input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$d$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, d, k \\\\le 4 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputIf there is no tree satisfying the conditions above, print only one word \"NO\" (without quotes).Otherwise in the first line print \"YES\" (without quotes), and then print $$$n - 1$$$ lines describing edges of a tree satisfying the conditions above. Vertices of the tree must be numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. You can print edges and vertices connected by an edge in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.1ExamplesInput6 3 3OutputYES3 14 11 25 22 6Input6 2 3OutputNOInput10 4 3OutputYES2 92 1010 33 16 108 24 35 66 7Input8 5 3OutputYES2 57 23 73 11 68 74 3",
