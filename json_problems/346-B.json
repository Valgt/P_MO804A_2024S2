Lucky Common Subsequencetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutIn mathematics, asubsequenceis a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequenceBDFis a subsequence ofABCDEF. Asubstringof a string is a continuous subsequence of the string. For example,BCDis a substring ofABCDEF.You are given two stringss1,s2and another string calledvirus. Your task is to find the longest common subsequence ofs1ands2, such that it doesn't containvirusas a substring.InputThe input contains three strings in three separate lines:s1,s2andvirus(1 ≤ |s1|, |s2|, |virus| ≤ 100). Each string consists only of uppercase English letters.OutputOutput the longest common subsequence ofs1ands2withoutvirusas a substring. If there are multiple answers, any of them will be accepted.If there is no valid common subsequence, output 0.ExamplesInputAJKEQSLOBSROFGZOVGURWZLWVLUXTHOZOutputORZInputAAAAOutput0",
