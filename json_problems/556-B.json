He is now investigating a case of frauds who make fake copies of the famous Stolp's gears, puzzles that are as famous as the Rubik's cube once was.Its most important components are a button and a line ofnsimilar gears. Each gear hasnteeth containing all numbers from0ton- 1in the counter-clockwise order. When you push a button, the first gear rotatesclockwise, then the second gear rotatescounter-clockwise, the the third gear rotatesclockwisean so on.Besides, each gear has exactly one active tooth. When a gear turns, a new active tooth is the one following after the current active tooth according to the direction of the rotation. For example, ifn= 5, and the active tooth is the one containing number0, then clockwise rotation makes the tooth with number1active, or the counter-clockwise rotating makes the tooth number4active.Andrewid remembers that the real puzzle has the following property: you can push the button multiple times in such a way that in the end the numbers on the active teeth of the gears from first to last form sequence0, 1, 2, ...,n- 1. Write a program that determines whether the given puzzle is real or fake.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 1000) — the number of gears.The second line containsndigitsa1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤n- 1) — the sequence of active teeth: the active tooth of thei-th gear contains numberai.OutputIn a single line print\"Yes\"(without the quotes), if the given Stolp's gears puzzle is real, and\"No\"(without the quotes) otherwise.ExamplesInput31 0 0OutputYesInput54 2 1 4 3OutputYesInput40 2 3 1OutputNoNoteIn the first sample test when you push the button for the first time, the sequence of active teeth will be2 2 1, when you push it for the second time, you get0 1 2.",
