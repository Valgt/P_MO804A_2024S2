Vanya and Fencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVanya and his friends are walking along the fence of heighthand they do not want the guard to notice them. In order to achieve this the height of each of the friends should not exceedh. If the height of some person is greater thanhhe can bend down and then he surely won't be noticed by the guard. The height of thei-th person is equal toai.Consider the width of the person walking as usual to be equal to1, while the width of the bent person is equal to2. Friends want to talk to each other while walking, so they would like to walk in a single row. What is the minimum width of the road, such that friends can walk in a row and remain unattended by the guard?InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandh(1 ≤n≤ 1000,1 ≤h≤ 1000) — the number of friends and the height of the fence, respectively.The second line containsnintegersai(1 ≤ai≤ 2h), thei-th of them is equal to the height of thei-th person.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum possible valid width of the road.ExamplesInput3 74 5 14Output4Input6 11 1 1 1 1 1Output6Input6 57 6 8 9 10 5Output11NoteIn the first sample, only person number3must bend down, so the required width is equal to1 + 1 + 2 = 4.In the second sample, all friends are short enough and no one has to bend, so the width1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6is enough.In the third sample, all the persons have to bend, except the last one. The required minimum width of the road is equal to2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 11.",
