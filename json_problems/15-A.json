By now they have already built in «Flatville»nsquare houses with the centres on theОx-axis. The houses' sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. It's known that no two houses overlap, but they can touch each other.The architect bureau, where Peter works, was commissioned to build a new house in «Flatville». The customer wants his future house to be on theОx-axis, to be square in shape, have a sidet, and touch at least one of the already built houses. For sure, its sides should be parallel to the coordinate axes, its centre should be on theOx-axis and it shouldn't overlap any of the houses in the village.Peter was given a list of all the houses in «Flatville». Would you help him find the amount of possible positions of the new house?InputThe first line of the input data contains numbersnandt(1 ≤n,t≤ 1000). Then there follownlines, each of them contains two space-separated integer numbers:xiai, wherexi—x-coordinate of the centre of thei-th house, andai— length of its side (- 1000 ≤xi≤ 1000,1 ≤ai≤ 1000).OutputOutput the amount of possible positions of the new house.ExamplesInput2 20 46 2Output4Input2 20 45 2Output3Input2 30 45 2Output2NoteIt is possible for thex-coordinate of the new house to have non-integer value.",
