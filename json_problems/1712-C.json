Sort Zerotime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAn array is sorted if it has no inversionsA Young BoyYou are given an array of $$$n$$$positiveintegers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$.In one operation you do the following:Chooseanyinteger $$$x$$$.For all $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i = x$$$, do $$$a_i := 0$$$ (assign $$$0$$$ to $$$a_i$$$).Find the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$positiveintegers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print one integer — the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.ExampleInput533 3 241 3 1 354 1 5 3 242 4 1 211Output1 2 4 3 0NoteIn the first test case, you can choose $$$x = 3$$$ for the operation, the resulting array is $$$[0, 0, 2]$$$.In the second test case, you can choose $$$x = 1$$$ for the first operation and $$$x = 3$$$ for the second operation, the resulting array is $$$[0, 0, 0, 0]$$$.",
