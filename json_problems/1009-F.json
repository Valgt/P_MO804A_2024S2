Dominant Indicestime limit per test4.5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a rooted undirected tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. Vertex $$$1$$$ is the root.Let's denote adepth arrayof vertex $$$x$$$ as an infinite sequence $$$[d_{x, 0}, d_{x, 1}, d_{x, 2}, \\\\dots]$$$, where $$$d_{x, i}$$$ is the number of vertices $$$y$$$ such that both conditions hold:$$$x$$$ is an ancestor of $$$y$$$;the simple path from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$ traverses exactly $$$i$$$ edges.Thedominant indexof adepth arrayof vertex $$$x$$$ (or, shortly, thedominant indexof vertex $$$x$$$) is an index $$$j$$$ such that:for every $$$k < j$$$, $$$d_{x, k} < d_{x, j}$$$;for every $$$k > j$$$, $$$d_{x, k} \\\\le d_{x, j}$$$.For every vertex in the tree calculate itsdominant index.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^6$$$) â€” the number of vertices in a tree.Then $$$n - 1$$$ lines follow, each containing two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x, y \\\\le n$$$, $$$x \\\\ne y$$$). This line denotes an edge of the tree.It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.OutputOutput $$$n$$$ numbers. $$$i$$$-th number should be equal to thedominant indexof vertex $$$i$$$.ExamplesInput41 22 33 4Output0000Input41 21 31 4Output1000Input41 22 32 4Output2100",
