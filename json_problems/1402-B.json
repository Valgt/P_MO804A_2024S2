There are $$$2N$$$ cities in Treeland. The unfinished plan of the road network already contains $$$N$$$ road segments, each of which connects two cities with a straight line. No two road segments have a common point (including their endpoints).  Your task is to determine $$$N-1$$$ additional road segments satisfying the following conditions:Every new road segment must connect two cities with a straight line.If two segments (new or old) have a common point, then this point must be an endpoint of both segments.The road network connects all cities: for each pair of cities there is a path consisting of segments that connects the two cities.InputThe first line of the standard input contains $$$N$$$ ($$${2 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 10^5}$$$) â€“ the number of existing road segments. Each of the following $$$N$$$ lines contains four integers: $$$x_1,y_1, x_2, y_2$$$, where $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ are the coordinates of the endpoints of the segment $$$(-10^7 \\\\leq x_i,y_i\\\\leq 10^7)$$$.OutputThe standard output must contain $$$N-1$$$ lines, each of them containing four integers, $$$x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$$$, where $$$(x_1,y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ are the coordinates of the cities that are the endpoints of a new road segment. If there are multiple solutions, your program may output any of them.Scoring$$$ \\\\begin{array}{|c|c|l|} \\\\hline \\\\text{Subtask} & \\\\text{Points} & \\\\text{Constraints} \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 1 & 0 & \\\\text{samples}\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 2 & 15 & \\\\text{all input segments are vertical.} \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 3 & 15 & \\\\text{each pair of input segments are parallel.} \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 4 & 15 & \\\\text{each input segment is either horizontal or vertical.} \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 5 & 15 & N \\\\le 10\\\\,000 \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 6 & 40 & \\\\text{no additional constraints}\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\end{array} $$$ExampleInput5 1 3 3 6 5 1 5 3 3 3 6 5 2 1 4 1 2 3 4 2Output2 1 1 3 2 3 2 1 3 3 2 3 5 1 4 2Note",
