Last year he learned Japanese traditional clothes and visual arts and now he is trying to find out the secret of the Japanese game called Nonogram.In the one-dimensional version of the game, there is a row of $$$n$$$ empty cells, some of which are to be filled with a pen. There is a description of a solution called aprofile— a sequence of positive integers denoting the lengths of consecutive sets of filled cells. For example, the profile of $$$[4, 3, 1]$$$ means that there are sets of four, three, and one filled cell, in that order, with at least one empty cell between successive sets.A suitable solution for $$$n = 12$$$ and $$$p = [4, 3, 1]$$$.A wrong solution: the first four filled cells should be consecutive.A wrong solution: there should be at least one empty cell before the last filled cell.Joseph found out that for some numbers $$$n$$$ and profiles $$$p$$$ there are lots of ways to fill the cells to satisfy the profile. Now he is in the process of solving a nonogram consisting of $$$n$$$ cells and a profile $$$p$$$. He has already created amaskof $$$p$$$ — he has filled all the cells that must be filled in every solution of the nonogram.The mask for $$$n = 12$$$ and $$$p = [4, 3, 1]$$$: all the filled cells above are filled in every solution.After a break, he lost the source profile $$$p$$$. He only has $$$n$$$ and the mask $$$m$$$. Help Joseph find any profile $$$p'$$$ with the mask $$$m$$$ or say that there is no such profile and Joseph has made a mistake.InputThe only line contains a string $$$m$$$ — the mask of the source profile $$$p$$$. The length of $$$m$$$ is $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$). The string $$$m$$$ consists of symbols#and_— denoting filled and empty cells respectively.OutputIf there is no profile with the mask $$$m$$$, output the number $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, on the first line, output an integer $$$k$$$ — the number of integers in the profile $$$p'$$$. On the second line, output $$$k$$$ integers of the profile $$$p'$$$.ExamplesInput__#_____Output2 3 2Input_#Output-1Input___Output0",
