This morning the Three-Dimensional kingdom declared war on the Two-dimensional one. This (possibly armed) conflict will determine the ultimate owner of the straight line.The Two-dimensional kingdom has a regular army ofnpeople. Each soldier registered himself and indicated the desired size of the bulletproof vest: thei-th soldier indicated sizeai. The soldiers are known to be unpretentious, so the command staff assumes that the soldiers are comfortable in any vests with sizes fromai-xtoai+y, inclusive (numbersx,y≥ 0are specified).The Two-dimensional kingdom hasmvests at its disposal, thej-th vest's size equalsbj. Help mobilize the Two-dimensional kingdom's army: equip with vests as many soldiers as possible. Each vest can be used only once. Thei-th soldier can put on thej-th vest, ifai-x≤bj≤ai+y.InputThe first input line contains four integersn,m,xandy(1 ≤n,m≤ 105,0 ≤x,y≤ 109) — the number of soldiers, the number of vests and two numbers that specify the soldiers' unpretentiousness, correspondingly.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) in non-decreasing order, separated by single spaces — the desired sizes of vests.The third line containsmintegersb1,b2, ...,bm(1 ≤bj≤ 109) in non-decreasing order, separated by single spaces — the sizes of the available vests.OutputIn the first line print a single integerk— the maximum number of soldiers equipped with bulletproof vests.In the nextklines printkpairs, one pair per line, as \"uivi\" (without the quotes). Pair (ui,vi) means that soldier numberuimust wear vest numbervi. Soldiers and vests are numbered starting from one in the order in which they are specified in the input. All numbers of soldiers in the pairs should be pairwise different, all numbers of vests in the pairs also should be pairwise different. You can print the pairs in any order.If there are multiple optimal answers, you are allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput5 3 0 01 2 3 3 41 3 5Output21 13 2Input3 3 2 21 5 93 5 7Output31 12 23 3NoteIn the first sample you need the vests' sizes to match perfectly: the first soldier gets the first vest (size 1), the third soldier gets the second vest (size 3). This sample allows another answer, which gives the second vest to the fourth soldier instead of the third one.In the second sample the vest size can differ from the desired size by at most 2 sizes, so all soldiers can be equipped.",
