In other words, if we write elements of the sets in the array in the increasing order, these arrays would be equal.Note, that any set of integers (or its permutation) generates itself.You are given a setYand have to find a setXthat generatesYand themaximum element ofXis mininum possible.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 50 000) — the number of elements inY.The second line containsnintegersy1, ...,yn(1 ≤yi≤ 109), that are guaranteed to be distinct.OutputPrintnintegers — set of distinct integers that generateYand the maximum element of which is minimum possible.
