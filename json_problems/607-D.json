However, a different type of tree caught their attention, the exalted Power Tree.A Power Tree starts out as a single root vertex indexed1. A Power Tree grows through a magical phenomenon known as an update. In anupdate, a single vertex is added to the tree as a child of some other vertex.Every vertex in the tree (the root and all the added vertices) has some valueviassociated with it. Thepowerof a vertex is defined as the strength of the multiset composed of the value associated with this vertex (vi) and thepowersof its direct children. Thestrengthof a multiset is defined as the sum of all elements in themultisetmultiplied by the number of elements in it. Or in other words for somemultisetS:Saitama knows theupdatesthat will be performed on the tree, so he decided to test Genos by asking him queries about the tree during its growth cycle.An update is of the form1pv, and adds a new vertex with valuevas a child of vertexp.A query is of the form2u, and asks for the power of vertexu.Please help Genos respond to these queries modulo109+ 7.InputThe first line of the input contains two space separated integersv1andq(1 ≤v1< 109,1 ≤q≤ 200 000) — the value of vertex1and the total number of updates and queries respectively.The nextqlines contain the updates and queries. Each of them has one of the following forms:1pivi, if these line describes an update. The index of the added vertex is equal to the smallest positive integer not yet used as an index in the tree. It is guaranteed thatpiis some already existing vertex and1 ≤vi< 109.2ui, if these line describes a query. It is guaranteeduiwill exist in the tree.It is guaranteed that the input will contain at least one query.OutputFor each query, print out the power of the given vertex modulo109+ 7.ExamplesInput2 51 1 31 2 51 3 71 4 112 1Output344Input5 51 1 41 2 32 21 2 72 1Output1494NoteFor the first sample case, after all the updates the graph will have vertices labelled in the following manner: 1 — 2 — 3 — 4 — 5These vertices will have corresponding values: 2 — 3 — 5 — 7 — 11And corresponding powers: 344 — 170 — 82 — 36 — 11",
