Exactly two of your friends should appear in each picture and no two pictures should contain the same pair of your friends. So if you haven= 3friends you can take3different pictures, each containing a pair of your friends.Each of your friends has an attractiveness level which is specified by the integer numberaifor thei-th friend. You know that the attractiveness of a picture containing thei-th and thej-th friends is equal to the exclusive-or (xoroperation) of integersaiandaj.You want to take pictures in a way that the total sum of attractiveness of your pictures is maximized. You have to calculate this value. Since the result may not fit in a 32-bit integer number, print it modulo1000000007(109+ 7).InputThe first line of input contains two integersnandm— the number of friends and the number of pictures that you want to take.Next line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤ 109) — the values of attractiveness of the friends.OutputThe only line of output should contain an integer — the optimal total sum of attractiveness of your pictures.ExamplesInput3 11 2 3Output3Input3 21 2 3Output5Input3 31 2 3Output6",
