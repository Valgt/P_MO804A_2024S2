Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits4and7. For example, numbers47,744,4are lucky and5,17,467are not.Petya calls a numberalmost luckyif it could be evenly divided by some lucky number. Help him find out if the given numbernis almost lucky.InputThe single line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 1000)— the number that needs to be checked.OutputIn the only line print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if numbernis almost lucky. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).ExamplesInput47OutputYESInput16OutputYESInput78OutputNONoteNote that all lucky numbers are almost lucky as any number is evenly divisible by itself.In the first sample47is a lucky number. In the second sample16is divisible by4.",
