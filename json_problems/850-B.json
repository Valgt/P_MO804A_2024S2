He calls a list bad if and only if it is not empty andgcd(see notes section for more information) of numbers in the list is1.Arpa can perform two types of operations:Choose a number and delete it with costx.Choose a number and increase it by1with costy.Arpa can apply these operations to as many numbers as he wishes, and he is allowed to apply the second operation arbitrarily many times on the same number.Help Arpa to find the minimum possible cost to make the list good.InputFirst line contains three integersn,xandy(1 ≤n≤ 5·105,1 ≤x,y≤ 109) — the number of elements in the list and the integersxandy.Second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 106) — the elements of the list.OutputPrint a single integer: the minimum possible cost to make the list good.ExamplesInput4 23 171 17 17 16Output40Input10 6 2100 49 71 73 66 96 8 60 41 63Output10NoteIn example, number1must be deleted (with cost23) and number16must increased by1(with cost17).Agcd(greatest common divisor) of a set of numbers is the maximum integer that divides all integers in the set.
