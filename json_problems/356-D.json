    "statement": "D. Bags and Coinstime limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutWhen you were a child you must have been told a puzzle of bags and coins. Anyway, here's one of its versions:A horse has three bags. The first bag has one coin, the second bag has one coin and the third bag has three coins. In total, the horse has three coins in the bags. How is that possible?The answer is quite simple. The third bag contains a coin and two other bags.This problem is a generalization of the childhood puzzle. You havenbags. You know that the first bag containsa1coins, the second bag containsa2coins, ..., then-th bag containsancoins. In total, there arescoins. Find the way to arrange the bags and coins so that they match the described scenario or else state that it is impossible to do.InputThe first line contains two integersnands(1 ≤n,s≤ 70000)— the number of bags and the total number of coins. The next line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 70000), whereaishows the number of coins in thei-th bag.OutputIf the answer doesn't exist, print-1.Otherwise, printnlines, on thei-th line print the contents of thei-th bag. The first number in the line,ci(0 ≤ci≤ai), must represent the number of coins lying directly in thei-th bag (the coins in the bags that are in thei-th bag are not taken into consideration). The second number in the line,ki(0 ≤ki<n)must represent the number of bags that lie directly in thei-th bag (the bags that are inside the bags lying in thei-th bag are not taken into consideration). Next, the line must containkiintegers — the numbers of the bags that are lying directly in thei-th bag.The total number of coins in the solution must equals. If we count the total number of coins thei-th bag in the solution has, we should getai.No bag can directly lie in more than one bag. The bags can be nested in more than one level (see the second test case). If there are multiple correct answers, you can print any of them.ExamplesInput3 31 3 1Output1 01 2 3 11 0Input3 31 3 1Output1 02 1 30 1 1Input1 21Output-1Input8 102 7 3 4 1 3 1 2Output2 01 2 1 40 2 7 80 2 5 61 03 01 02 0NoteThe pictures below show two possible ways to solve one test case from the statement.
