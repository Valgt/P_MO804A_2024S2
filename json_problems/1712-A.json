Wonderful Permutationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGod's Blessing on This PermutationForces!A Random PebbleYou are given a permutation $$$p_1,p_2,\\\\ldots,p_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a positive integer $$$k \\\\le n$$$.In one operation you can choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n$$$) and swap $$$p_i$$$ with $$$p_j$$$.Find the minimum number of operations needed to make the sum $$$p_1 + p_2 + \\\\ldots + p_k$$$ as small as possible.A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\\\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that the given numbers form a permutation of length $$$n$$$.OutputFor each test case print one integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make the sum $$$p_1 + p_2 + \\\\ldots + p_k$$$ as small as possible.ExampleInput43 12 3 13 31 2 34 23 4 1 21 11Output1 0 2 0NoteIn the first test case, the value of $$$p_1 + p_2 + \\\\ldots + p_k$$$ is initially equal to $$$2$$$, but the smallest possible value is $$$1$$$. You can achieve it by swapping $$$p_1$$$ with $$$p_3$$$, resulting in the permutation $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$.In the second test case, the sum is already as small as possible, so the answer is $$$0$$$.",
