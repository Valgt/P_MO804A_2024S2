They have a set that initially consists of $$$n$$$ integers. The game is played in $$$k$$$ turns. During each turn, the following events happen:firstly, Alice chooses an integer from the set. She can choose any integerexcept for the maximum one. Let the integer chosen by Alice be $$$a$$$;secondly, Bob chooses an integer from the set. He can choose any integerthat is greater than $$$a$$$. Let the integer chosen by Bob be $$$b$$$;finally, both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are erased from the set, and the value of $$$b - a$$$ is added to the score of the game.Initially, the score is $$$0$$$. Alice wants to maximize the resulting score, Bob wants to minimize it. Assuming that both Alice and Bob play optimally, calculate the resulting score of the game.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 400$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le \\\\lfloor\\\\frac{n}{2}\\\\rfloor$$$) — the initial size of the set and the number of turns in the game.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the initial contents of the set. These integers are pairwise distinct.OutputPrint one integer — the resulting score of the game (assuming that both Alice and Bob play optimally).ExamplesInput5 2 3 4 1 5 2Output4Input7 3 101 108 200 1 201 109 100Output283",
