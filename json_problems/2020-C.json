Bitwise Balancingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three non-negative integers $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, and $$$d$$$.Please find a non-negative integer $$$a \\\\in [0, 2^{61}]$$$ such that $$$(a\\\\, |\\\\, b)-(a\\\\, \\\\&\\\\, c)=d$$$, where $$$|$$$ and $$$\\\\&$$$ denote thebitwise OR operationand thebitwise AND operation, respectively.If such an $$$a$$$ exists, print its value. If there is no solution, print a single integer $$$-1$$$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains three positive integers $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, and $$$d$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le b, c, d \\\\le 10^{18}$$$).OutputFor each test case, output the value of $$$a$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if there is no solution. Please note that $$$a$$$ must be non-negative and cannot exceed $$$2^{61}$$$.ExampleInput32 2 24 2 610 2 14Output0 -1 12NoteIn the first test case, $$$(0\\\\,|\\\\,2)-(0\\\\,\\\\&\\\\,2)=2-0=2$$$. So, $$$a = 0$$$ is a correct answer.In the second test case, no value of $$$a$$$ satisfies the equation.In the third test case, $$$(12\\\\,|\\\\,10)-(12\\\\,\\\\&\\\\,2)=14-0=14$$$. So, $$$a = 12$$$ is a correct answer.",
