Positions of all prizes are distinct. You start at position1, your friend — at position106(and there is no prize in any of these two positions). You have to work as a team and collect all prizes in minimum possible time, in any order.You know that it takes exactly1second to move from positionxto positionx+ 1orx- 1, both for you and your friend. You also have trained enough to instantly pick up any prize, if its position is equal to your current position (and the same is true for your friend). Carrying prizes does not affect your speed (or your friend's speed) at all.Now you may discuss your strategy with your friend and decide who will pick up each prize. Remember that every prize must be picked up, either by you or by your friend.What is the minimum number of seconds it will take to pick up all the prizes?InputThe first line contains one integern(1 ≤n≤ 105) — the number of prizes.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(2 ≤ai≤ 106- 1) — the positions of the prizes. No two prizes are located at the same position. Positions are given in ascending order.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum number of seconds it will take to collect all prizes.ExamplesInput32 3 9Output8Input22 999995Output5NoteIn the first example you take all the prizes: take the first at1, the second at2and the third at8.In the second example you take the first prize in1second and your friend takes the other in5seconds, you do this simultaneously, so the total time is5.",
