For every,Ai,j=y(i- 1) +j. Obviously, every integer from[1..xy]occurs exactly once in this matrix.You have traversed some path in this matrix. Your path can be described as a sequence of visited cellsa1,a2, ...,andenoting that you started in the cell containing the numbera1, then moved to the cell with the numbera2, and so on.From the cell located ini-th line andj-th column (we denote this cell as(i,j)) you can move into one of the following cells:(i+ 1,j)— only ifi<x;(i,j+ 1)— only ifj<y;(i- 1,j)— only ifi> 1;(i,j- 1)— only ifj> 1.Notice that making a move requires you to go to an adjacent cell. It is not allowed to stay in the same cell. You don't knowxandyexactly, but you have to find any possible values for these numbers such that you could start in the cell containing the integera1, then move to the cell containinga2(in one step), then move to the cell containinga3(also in one step) and so on. Can you choosexandyso that they don't contradict with your sequence of moves?InputThe first line contains one integer numbern(1 ≤n≤ 200000) — the number of cells you visited on your path (if some cell is visited twice, then it's listed twice).The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — the integers in the cells on your path.OutputIf all possible values ofxandysuch that1 ≤x,y≤ 109contradict with the information about your path, printNO.Otherwise, printYESin the first line, and in the second line print the valuesxandysuch that your path was possible with such number of lines and columns in the matrix. Remember that they must be positive integers not exceeding109.ExamplesInput81 2 3 6 9 8 5 2OutputYES3 3Input61 2 1 2 5 3OutputNOInput21 10OutputYES4 9NoteThe matrix and the path on it in the first test looks like this:Also there exist multiple correct answers for both the first and the third examples.",
