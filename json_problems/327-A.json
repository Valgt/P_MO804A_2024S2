Flipping Gametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutIahub got bored, so he invented a game to be played on paper.He writesnintegersa1,a2, ...,an. Each of those integers can be either 0 or 1. He's allowed to do exactly one move: he chooses two indicesiandj(1 ≤i≤j≤n) and flips all valuesakfor which their positions are in range[i,j](that isi≤k≤j). Flip the value ofxmeans to apply operationx= 1-x.The goal of the game is that afterexactlyone move to obtain the maximum number of ones. Write a program to solve the little game of Iahub.InputThe first line of the input contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 100). In the second line of the input there arenintegers:a1,a2, ...,an. It is guaranteed that each of thosenvalues is either 0 or 1.OutputPrint an integer — the maximal number of 1s that can be obtained after exactly one move.ExamplesInput51 0 0 1 0Output4Input41 0 0 1Output4NoteIn the first case, flip the segment from 2 to 5(i= 2,j= 5). That flip changes the sequence, it becomes: [1 1 1 0 1]. So, it contains four ones. There is no way to make the whole sequence equal to [1 1 1 1 1].In the second case, flipping only the second and the third element(i= 2,j= 3)will turn all numbers into 1.",
