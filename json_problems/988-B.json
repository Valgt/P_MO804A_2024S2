Each string consists of lowercase English letters. Rearrange (reorder) the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are itssubstrings.String $$$a$$$ is asubstringof string $$$b$$$ if it is possible to choose severalconsecutiveletters in $$$b$$$ in such a way that they form $$$a$$$. For example, string \"for\" is contained as asubstringin strings \"codeforces\", \"for\" and \"therefore\", but is not contained as asubstringin strings \"four\", \"fofo\" and \"rof\".InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) â€” the number of strings.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain the given strings. The number of letters in each string is from $$$1$$$ to $$$100$$$, inclusive. Each string consists of lowercase English letters.Some strings might be equal.OutputIf it is impossible to reorder $$$n$$$ given strings in required order, print \"NO\" (without quotes).Otherwise print \"YES\" (without quotes) and $$$n$$$ given strings in required order.ExamplesInput5aabaabacababaabaOutputYESabaabaabaabacabaInput5aabacababaabaababOutputNOInput3qwertyqwertyqwertyOutputYESqwertyqwertyqwertyNoteIn the second example you cannot reorder the strings because the string \"abab\" is not asubstringof the string \"abacaba\".",
