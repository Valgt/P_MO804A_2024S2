DZY Loves Fibonacci Numberstime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutIn mathematical terms, the sequenceFnof Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relationF1= 1;F2= 1;Fn=Fn- 1+Fn- 2(n> 2).DZY loves Fibonacci numbers very much. Today DZY gives you an array consisting ofnintegers:a1,a2, ...,an. Moreover, there aremqueries, each query has one of the two types:Format of the query \"1lr\". In reply to the query, you need to addFi-l+ 1to each elementai, wherel≤i≤r.Format of the query \"2lr\". In reply to the query you should output the value ofmodulo1000000009 (109+ 9).Help DZY reply to all the queries.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 300000). The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109)— initial arraya.Then,mlines follow. A single line describes a single query in the format given in the statement. It is guaranteed that for each query inequality1 ≤l≤r≤nholds.OutputFor each query of the second type, print the value of the sum on a single line.ExamplesInput4 41 2 3 41 1 42 1 41 2 42 1 3Output1712NoteAfter the first query,a= [2, 3, 5, 7].For the second query,sum= 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.After the third query,a= [2, 4, 6, 9].For the fourth query,sum= 2 + 4 + 6 = 12.",
