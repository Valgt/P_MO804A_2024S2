The only difference between an easy and a hard version is the constraints on $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$.You are given $$$4$$$ positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ with $$$a < c$$$ and $$$b < d$$$. Find any pair of numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ that satisfies the following conditions:$$$a < x \\\\leq c$$$, $$$b < y \\\\leq d$$$,$$$x \\\\cdot y$$$ is divisible by $$$a \\\\cdot b$$$.Note that required $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ may not exist.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10$$$), the number of test cases.The descriptions of the test cases follow.The only line of each test case contains four integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a < c \\\\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq b < d \\\\leq 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case print a pair of numbers $$$a < x \\\\leq c$$$ and $$$b < y \\\\leq d$$$ such that $$$x \\\\cdot y$$$ is divisible by $$$a \\\\cdot b$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If there is no such pair of numbers, then print-1 -1.ExampleInput101 1 2 23 4 5 78 9 15 1812 21 14 2436 60 48 661024 729 373248 7301024 729 373247 7305040 40320 40319 1000000000999999999 999999999 1000000000 1000000000268435456 268435456 1000000000 1000000000Output2 2 4 6 12 12 -1 -1 -1 -1 373248 730 -1 -1 15120 53760 -1 -1 536870912 536870912",
