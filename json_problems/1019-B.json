The hattime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problem.Imur Ishakov decided to organize a club for people who love to play the famous game «The hat». The club was visited bynstudents, wherenis even. Imur arranged them all in a circle and held a draw to break the students in pairs, but something went wrong. The participants are numbered so that participantiand participanti+ 1(1 ≤i≤n- 1) are adjacent, as well as participantnand participant1. Each student was given a piece of paper with a number in such a way, that for every two adjacent students, these numbers differ exactly by one. The plan was to form students with the same numbers in a pair, but it turned out that not all numbers appeared exactly twice.As you know, the most convenient is to explain the words to the partner when he is sitting exactly across you. Students with numbersiandsit across each other. Imur is wondering if there are two people sitting across each other with the same numbers given. Help him to find such pair of people if it exists.You can ask questions of form «which number was received by studenti?», and the goal is to determine whether the desired pair exists in no more than60questions.InputAt the beginning the even integern(2 ≤n≤ 100 000) is given — the total number of students.You are allowed to ask no more than60questions.OutputTo ask the question about the studenti(1 ≤i≤n), you should print «?i». Then from standard output you can read the numberaireceived by studenti(- 109≤ai≤ 109).When you find the desired pair, you should print «!i», whereiis any student who belongs to the pair (1 ≤i≤n). If you determined that such pair doesn't exist, you should output «! -1». In both cases you should immediately terminate the program.The query that contains your answer is not counted towards the limit of60queries.Please make sure to flush the standard output after each command. For example, in C++ use functionfflush(stdout), in Java callSystem.out.flush(), in Pascal useflush(output)andstdout.flush()for Python language.HackingUse the following format for hacking:In the first line, print one even integern(2 ≤n≤ 100 000) — the total number of students.In the second line printnintegersai(- 109≤ai≤ 109) separated by spaces, whereaiis the number to give toi-th student. Any two adjacent elements, includingnand1, must differ by1or- 1.The hacked solution will not have direct access to the sequenceai.ExamplesInput822Output? 4? 8! 4Input6123210Output? 1? 2? 3? 4? 5? 6! -1NoteInput-output in statements illustrates example interaction.In the first sample the selected sequence is1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2In the second sample the selection sequence is1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0.",
