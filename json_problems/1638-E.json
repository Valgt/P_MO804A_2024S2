Each element initially has value $$$0$$$ and color $$$1$$$. You are also given $$$q$$$ queries to perform:Color $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ $$$c$$$: Change the color of elements $$$a_l,a_{l+1},\\\\cdots,a_r$$$ to $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$, $$$1 \\\\le c \\\\le n$$$).Add $$$c$$$ $$$x$$$: Add $$$x$$$ to values of all elements $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$) of color $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c \\\\le n$$$, $$$-10^9 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^9$$$).Query $$$i$$$: Print $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$).InputThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n,q \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries you have to perform.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains the query given in the form described in the problem statement.OutputPrint the answers to the queries of the third type on separate lines.ExamplesInput5 8 Color 2 4 2 Add 2 2 Query 3 Color 4 5 3 Color 2 2 3 Add 3 3 Query 2 Query 5Output2 5 3Input2 7 Add 1 7 Query 1 Add 2 4 Query 2 Color 1 1 1 Add 1 1 Query 2Output7 7 8NoteThe first sample test is explained below. Blue, red and green represent colors $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ respectively.",
