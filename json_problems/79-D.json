Passwordtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutFinally Fox Ciel arrived in front of her castle!She have to type a password to enter her castle. An input device attached to her castle is a bit unusual.The input device is a1 ×nrectangle divided intonsquare panels. They are numbered1tonfrom left to right. Each panel has a state either ON or OFF. Initially all panels are in the OFF state. She can enter her castle if and only ifx1-th,x2-th,...,xk-th panels are in the ON state and other panels are in the OFF state.She is given an arraya1,...,al. In each move, she can perform the following operation: choose an indexi(1 ≤i≤l), choose consecutiveaipanels, and flip the states of those panels (i.e. ON→OFF, OFF→ON).Unfortunately she forgets how to type the password with only above operations. Determine the minimal number of operations required to enter her castle.InputThe first line contains three integersn,kandl(1 ≤n≤ 10000, 1 ≤k≤ 10, 1 ≤l≤ 100), separated by single spaces.The second line containskintegersx1, ...,xk(1 ≤x1<x2< ... <xk≤n), separated by single spaces.The third line containslintegersa1, ...,al(1 ≤ai≤n), separated by single spaces. It is possible that some elements of the arrayaiare equal value.OutputPrint the minimal number of moves required to type the password. If it's impossible, print-1.ExamplesInput10 8 21 2 3 5 6 7 8 93 5Output2Input3 2 11 23Output-1NoteOne possible way to type the password in the first example is following: In the first move, choose 1st, 2nd, 3rd panels and flip those panels. In the second move, choose 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th panels and flip those panels.",
