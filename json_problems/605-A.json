Sorting Railway Carstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAn infinitely long railway has a train consisting ofncars, numbered from1ton(the numbers of all the cars are distinct) and positioned in arbitrary order. David Blaine wants to sort the railway cars in the order of increasing numbers. In one move he can make one of the cars disappear from its place and teleport it either to the beginning of the train, or to the end of the train, at his desire. What is the minimum number of actions David Blaine needs to perform in order to sort the train?InputThe first line of the input contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 100 000) — the number of cars in the train.The second line containsnintegerspi(1 ≤pi≤n,pi≠pjifi≠j) — the sequence of the numbers of the cars in the train.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum number of actions needed to sort the railway cars.ExamplesInput54 1 2 5 3Output2Input44 1 3 2Output2NoteIn the first sample you need first to teleport the4-th car, and then the5-th car to the end of the train.",
