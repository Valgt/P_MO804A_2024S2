She is yet unfamiliar with the \"space\" key and can only type in lower-case Latin letters. Having typed for a fairly long line, Anfisa understood that it would be great to divide what she has written intoklines not shorter thanaand not longer thanb, for the text to resemble human speech more. Help Anfisa.InputThe first line contains three integersk,aandb(1 ≤k≤ 200,1 ≤a≤b≤ 200). The second line contains a sequence of lowercase Latin letters — the text typed by Anfisa. It is guaranteed that the given line is not empty and its length does not exceed200symbols.OutputPrintklines, each of which contains no less thanaand no more thanbsymbols — Anfisa's text divided into lines. It is not allowed to perform any changes in the text, such as: deleting or adding symbols, changing their order, etc. If the solution is not unique, print any of them. If there is no solution, print \"No solution\" (without quotes).ExamplesInput3 2 5abrakadabraOutputabrakadabraInput4 1 2abrakadabraOutputNo solution",
