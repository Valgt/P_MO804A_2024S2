Soon his informatics teacher is going to have a birthday and the beaver has decided to prepare a present for her. He plantednflowers in a row on his windowsill and started waiting for them to grow. However, after some time the beaver noticed that the flowers stopped growing. The beaver thinks it is bad manners to present little flowers. So he decided to come up with some solutions.There aremdays left to the birthday. The height of thei-th flower (assume that the flowers in the row are numbered from1tonfrom left to right) is equal toaiat the moment. At each of the remainingmdays the beaver can take a special watering and waterwcontiguous flowers (he can do that only once at a day). At that each watered flower grows by one height unit on that day. The beaver wants the height of the smallest flower be as large as possible in the end. What maximum height of the smallest flower can he get?InputThe first line contains space-separated integersn,mandw(1 ≤w≤n≤ 105; 1 ≤m≤ 105). The second line contains space-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109).OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum final height of the smallest flower.ExamplesInput6 2 32 2 2 2 1 1Output2Input2 5 15 8Output9NoteIn the first sample beaver can water the last 3 flowers at the first day. On the next day he may not to water flowers at all. In the end he will get the following heights: [2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2]. The smallest flower has height equal to 2. It's impossible to get height 3 in this test.",
