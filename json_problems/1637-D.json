Yet Another Minimization Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$n$$$.You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): select an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$) and swap $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$.Let's define thecostof the array $$$a$$$ as $$$\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\sum_{j=i + 1}^{n} (a_i + a_j)^2$$$. Similarly, thecostof the array $$$b$$$ is $$$\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\sum_{j=i + 1}^{n} (b_i + b_j)^2$$$.Your task is to minimize the totalcostof two arrays.InputEach test case consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 40$$$) — the number of test cases. The following is a description of the input data sets.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$$$) — the length of both arrays.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 100$$$) — elements of the first array.The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq b_i \\\\leq 100$$$) — elements of the second array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum possible total cost.ExampleInput313643 6 6 62 7 4 146 7 2 42 5 3 5Output0 987 914NoteIn the second test case, in one of the optimal answers after all operations $$$a = [2, 6, 4, 6]$$$, $$$b = [3, 7, 6, 1]$$$.The cost of the array $$$a$$$ equals to $$$(2 + 6)^2 + (2 + 4)^2 + (2 + 6)^2 + (6 + 4)^2 + (6 + 6)^2 + (4 + 6)^2 = 508$$$.The cost of the array $$$b$$$ equals to $$$(3 + 7)^2 + (3 + 6)^2 + (3 + 1)^2 + (7 + 6)^2 + (7 + 1)^2 + (6 + 1)^2 = 479$$$.The total cost of two arrays equals to $$$508 + 479 = 987$$$.",
