This collection consists of109types of toys, numbered with integers from1to109. A toy from the new collection of thei-th type costsibourles.Tania has managed to collectndifferent types of toysa1,a2, ...,anfrom the new collection. Today is Tanya's birthday, and her mother decided to spend no more thanmbourles on the gift to the daughter. Tanya will choose several different types of toys from the new collection as a gift. Of course, she does not want to get a type of toy which she already has.Tanya wants to have as many distinct types of toys in her collection as possible as the result. The new collection is too diverse, and Tanya is too little, so she asks you to help her in this.InputThe first line contains two integersn(1 ≤n≤ 100 000) andm(1 ≤m≤ 109) — the number of types of toys that Tanya already has and the number of bourles that her mom is willing to spend on buying new toys.The next line containsndistinct integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — the types of toys that Tanya already has.OutputIn the first line print a single integerk— the number of different types of toys that Tanya should choose so that the number of different types of toys in her collection is maximum possible. Of course, the total cost of the selected toys should not exceedm.In the second line printkdistinct space-separated integerst1,t2, ...,tk(1 ≤ti≤ 109) — the types of toys that Tanya should choose.If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

At any other purchase for7bourles (assuming that the toys of types1,3and4have already been bought), it is impossible to buy two and more toys.",
