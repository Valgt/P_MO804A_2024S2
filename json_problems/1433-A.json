Boring Apartmentstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a building consisting of $$$10~000$$$ apartments numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$10~000$$$, inclusive.Call an apartmentboring, if its number consists ofthe same digit. Examples of boring apartments are $$$11, 2, 777, 9999$$$ and so on.Our character is a troublemaker, and he calls the intercoms of allboringapartments, till someone answers the call, in the following order:First he calls all apartments consisting of digit $$$1$$$, in increasing order ($$$1, 11, 111, 1111$$$).Next he calls all apartments consisting of digit $$$2$$$, in increasing order ($$$2, 22, 222, 2222$$$)And so on.The resident of the boring apartment $$$x$$$ answers the call, and our characterstopscalling anyone further.Our character wants to know how many digits he pressed in total and your task is to help him to count the total number of keypresses.For example, if the resident of boring apartment $$$22$$$ answered, then our character called apartments with numbers $$$1, 11, 111, 1111, 2, 22$$$ and the total number of digits he pressed is $$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 13$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 36$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of the test case contains one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le 9999$$$) — the apartment number of the resident who answered the call. It is guaranteed that $$$x$$$ consists of the same digit.OutputFor each test case, print the answer: how many digits our character pressed in total.ExampleInput4 22 9999 1 777Output13 90 1 66",
