Dreamoon and Setstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutDreamoon likes to play with sets, integers and.is defined as the largest positive integer that divides bothaandb.LetSbe a set of exactly four distinct integers greater than0.

Calculate the minimummthat makes it possible and print one possible solution.InputThe single line of the input contains two space separated integersn,k(1 ≤n≤ 10 000, 1 ≤k≤ 100).OutputOn the first line print a single integer — the minimal possiblem.On each of the nextnlines print four space separated integers representing thei-th set.Neither the order of the sets nor the order of integers within a set is important. If there are multiple possible solutions with minimalm, print any one of them.ExamplesInput1 1Output51 2 3 5Input2 2Output222 4 6 2214 18 10 16NoteFor the first example it's easy to see that set{1, 2, 3, 4}isn't a valid set of rank 1 since.",
