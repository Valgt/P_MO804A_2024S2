There arenplayers playing the game, each player has a card with numbers. The numbers on each card are distinct, but distinct cards can have equal numbers. The card of thei-th player containsminumbers.During the game the host takes numbered balls one by one from a bag. He reads the number aloud in a high and clear voice and then puts the ball away. All participants cross out the number if it occurs on their cards. The person who crosses out all numbers from his card first, wins.
