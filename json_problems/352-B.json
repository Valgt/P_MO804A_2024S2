The boy immediately decided to analyze the sequence. For that, he needs to find all values ofx, for which these conditions hold:xoccurs in sequencea.Consider all positions of numbersxin the sequencea(suchi, thatai=x). These numbers, sorted in the increasing order, must form an arithmetic progression.Help Jeff, find allxthat meet the problem conditions.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105). The next line contains integersa1,a2,...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 105). The numbers are separated by spaces.OutputIn the first line print integert— the number of validx. On each of the nexttlines print two integersxandpx, wherexis current suitable value,pxis the common difference between numbers in the progression (ifxoccurs exactly once in the sequence,pxmust equal 0). Print the pairs in the order of increasingx.ExamplesInput12Output12 0Input81 2 1 3 1 2 1 5Output41 22 43 05 0NoteIn the first test2occurs exactly once in the sequence, ergop2= 0.",
