    "statement": "A. Colorful Stones (Simplified Edition)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThere is a sequence of colorful stones. The color of each stone is one of red, green, or blue. You are given a strings. Thei-th (1-based) character ofsrepresents the color of thei-th stone. If the character is \"R\", \"G\", or \"B\", the color of the corresponding stone is red, green, or blue, respectively.Initially Squirrel Liss is standing on the first stone. You perform instructions one or more times.Each instruction is one of the three types: \"RED\", \"GREEN\", or \"BLUE\". After an instructionc, if Liss is standing on a stone whose colors isc, Liss will move one stone forward, else she will not move.You are given a stringt. The number of instructions is equal to the length oft, and thei-th character oftrepresents thei-th instruction.Calculate the final position of Liss (the number of the stone she is going to stand on in the end) after performing all the instructions, and print its 1-based position. It is guaranteed that Liss don't move out of the sequence.InputThe input contains two lines. The first line contains the strings(1 ≤ |s| ≤ 50). The second line contains the stringt(1 ≤ |t| ≤ 50). The characters of each string will be one of \"R\", \"G\", or \"B\". It is guaranteed that Liss don't move out of the sequence.OutputPrint the final 1-based position of Liss in a single line.ExamplesInputRGBRRROutput2InputRRRBGBRBBBBBBRROutput3InputBRRBGBRGRBGRGRRGGBGBGBRGBRGRGGGRBRRRBRBBBGRRRGGBBBBBRBGGRGRGBBBRBGRBRBBBBRBRRRBGBBGBBRRBBGGRBRRBRGRBOutput15",
