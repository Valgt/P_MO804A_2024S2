Vasiliy's Multisettime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAuthor has gone out of the stories about Vasiliy, so here is just a formal task description.You are givenqqueries and a multisetA, initially containing only integer0. There are three types of queries:\"+ x\" — add integerxto multisetA.\"- x\" — erase one occurrence of integerxfrom multisetA. It's guaranteed that at least onexis present in the multisetAbefore this query.\"? x\" — you are given integerxand need to compute the value, i.e. the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (also know as XOR) of integerxand some integeryfrom the multisetA.Multiset is a set, where equal elements are allowed.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integerq(1 ≤q≤ 200 000) — the number of queries Vasiliy has to perform.Each of the followingqlines of the input contains one of three characters '+', '-' or '?' and an integerxi(1 ≤xi≤ 109). It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the third type.Note, that the integer0will always be present in the setA.OutputFor each query of the type '?' print one integer — the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of integerxiand some integer from the multisetA.ExampleInput10+ 8+ 9+ 11+ 6+ 1? 3- 8? 3? 8? 11Output11101413NoteAfter first five operations multisetAcontains integers0,8,9,11,6and1.The answer for the sixth query is integer— maximum among integers,,,and.",
