In other words, $$$S$$$ is the $$$0$$$-indexed binary string with infinite length that can be constructed as follows:Initially, let $$$S$$$ be \"0\".Then, we perform the following operation infinitely many times: concatenate $$$S$$$ with a copy of itself with flipped bits.For example, here are the first four iterations:Iteration$$$S$$$ before iteration$$$S$$$ before iteration with flipped bitsConcatenated $$$S$$$1010120110011030110100101101001401101001100101100110100110010110$$$\\\\ldots$$$$$$\\\\ldots$$$$$$\\\\ldots$$$$$$\\\\ldots$$$You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. Find the number of positions where the strings $$$S_0 S_1 \\\\ldots S_{m-1}$$$ and $$$S_n S_{n + 1} \\\\ldots S_{n + m - 1}$$$ are different.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first and only line of each test case contains two positive integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ respectively ($$$1 \\\\leq n,m \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$).OutputFor each testcase, output a non-negative integer — the Hamming distance between the two required strings.ExampleInput61 15 1034 21173 3419124639 5634877212073412269 96221437021Output1 6 95 20 28208137 48102976088NoteThe string $$$S$$$ is equal to0110100110010110....In the first test case, $$$S_0$$$ is \"0\", and $$$S_1$$$ is \"1\".
