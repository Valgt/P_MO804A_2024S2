Thanks to his revolutionary math discoveries he was able to make enough money to build a beautiful house. Unfortunately, for not paying property tax on time, court decided to punish Bill by making him lose a part of his property.Bill’s property can be observed as a convex regular2n-sided polygonA0A1...A2n- 1A2n,A2n=A0, with sides of the exactly 1 meter in length.Court rules for removing part of his property are as follows:Split every edgeAkAk+ 1,k= 0... 2n- 1innequal parts of size1 /nwith pointsP0,P1, ...,Pn- 1On every edgeA2kA2k+ 1,k= 0...n- 1court will choose one pointB2k=Pifor somei= 0, ...,n- 1such thatOn every edgeA2k+ 1A2k+ 2,k= 0...n- 1Bill will choose one pointB2k+ 1=Pifor somei= 0, ...,n- 1such thatBill gets to keep property inside of2n-sided polygonB0B1...B2n- 1Luckily, Bill found out whichB2kpoints the court chose. Even though he is a great mathematician, his house is very big and he has a hard time calculating. Therefore, he is asking you to help him choose points so he maximizes area of property he can keep.InputThe first line contains one integer numbern(2 ≤n≤ 50000), representing number of edges of2n-sided polygon.The second line containsndistinct integer numbersB2k(0 ≤B2k≤n- 1,k= 0...n- 1)separated by a single space, representing points the court chose. IfB2k=i, the court chose pointPion sideA2kA2k+ 1.OutputOutput containsndistinct integers separated by a single space representing pointsB1,B3, ...,B2n- 1Bill should choose in order to maximize the property area. If there are multiple solutions that maximize the area, return any of them.ExampleInput30 1 2Output0 2 1NoteTo maximize area Bill should choose points:B1=P0,B3=P2,B5=P1",
