Let's define a partition of $$$x$$$ such a sequence of strings $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\dots, s_k$$$ that $$$s_1 + s_2 + \\\\dots + s_k = x$$$, where $$$+$$$ is a concatanation of strings. $$$s_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of the partition. For example, number $$$12345$$$ has the following partitions: [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\"], [\"123\", \"4\", \"5\"], [\"1\", \"2345\"], [\"12345\"] and lots of others.Let's call some partition of $$$a$$$beautifulif each of its elementscontains no leading zeros.Vasya want to know the number ofbeautifulpartitions of number $$$a$$$, which has each of $$$s_i$$$ satisfy the condition $$$l \\\\le s_i \\\\le r$$$. Note that the comparison is the integer comparison, not the string one.Help Vasya to count the amount of partitions of number $$$a$$$ such that they match all the given requirements. The result can be rather big, so print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$a~(1 \\\\le a \\\\le 10^{1000000})$$$.The second line contains a single integer $$$l~(0 \\\\le l \\\\le 10^{1000000})$$$.The third line contains a single integer $$$r~(0 \\\\le r \\\\le 10^{1000000})$$$.It is guaranteed that $$$l \\\\le r$$$.It is also guaranteed that numbers $$$a, l, r$$$contain no leading zeros.OutputPrint a single integer — the amount of partitions of number $$$a$$$ such that they match all the given requirements modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExamplesInput135115Output2Input1000009Output1NoteIn the first test case, there are two good partitions $$$13+5$$$ and $$$1+3+5$$$.In the second test case, there is one good partition $$$1+0+0+0+0$$$.",
