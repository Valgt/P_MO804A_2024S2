Three Sonstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputinput.txtoutputoutput.txtThree sons inherited from their father a rectangular corn fiend divided inton×msquares. For each square we know how many tons of corn grows on it. The father, an old farmer did not love all three sons equally, which is why he bequeathed to divide his field into three parts containingA,BandCtons of corn.The field should be divided by two parallel lines. The lines should be parallel to one side of the field and to each other. The lines should go strictly between the squares of the field. Each resulting part of the field should consist of at least one square.Your task is to find the number of ways to divide the field as is described above, that is, to mark two lines, dividing the field in three parts so that on one of the resulting parts grewAtons of corn,Bon another one andCon the remaining one.InputThe first line contains space-separated integersnandm— the sizes of the original (1 ≤n,m≤ 50,max(n,m) ≥ 3). Then the field's description follows:nlines, each containingmspace-separated integerscij, (0 ≤cij≤ 100) — the number of tons of corn each square contains. The last line contains space-separated integersA,B,C(0 ≤A,B,C≤ 106).OutputPrint the answer to the problem: the number of ways to divide the father's field so that one of the resulting parts containedAtons of corn, another one containedBtons, and the remaining one containedCtons. If no such way exists, print 0.ExamplesInput3 31 1 11 1 11 1 13 3 3Output2Input2 51 1 1 1 12 2 2 2 23 6 6Output3Input3 31 2 33 1 22 3 15 6 7Output0NoteThe lines dividing the field can be horizontal or vertical, but they should be parallel to each other.",
