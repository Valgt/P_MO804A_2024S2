Detect Robotstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou successfully found poor Arkady near the exit of the station you've perfectly predicted. You sent him home on a taxi and suddenly came up with a question.There are $$$n$$$ crossroads in your city and several bidirectional roads connecting some of them. Ataxi rideis a path from some crossroads to another one without passing the same crossroads twice. You have a collection of rides made by one driver and now you wonder if this driver can be a robot or they are definitely a human.You think that the driver can be a robot if for every two crossroads $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ the driver always chooses the same path whenever he drives from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$. Note that $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ here do not have to be the endpoints of a ride and that the path from $$$b$$$ to $$$a$$$ can be different. On the contrary, if the driver ever has driven two different paths from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$, they are definitely a human.Given the system of roads and the description of all rides available to you, determine if the driver can be a robot or not.InputEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of crossroads in the city.The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of rides available to you.Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines starts with a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$) — the number of crossroads visited by the driver on this ride. It is followed by $$$k$$$ integers $$$c_1$$$, $$$c_2$$$, ..., $$$c_k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le n$$$) — the crossroads in the order the driver visited them. It is guaranteed that all crossroads in one ride are distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$k$$$ among all rides of all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ and the sum of values $$$q$$$ doesn't exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ among all test cases.OutputOutput a single line for each test case.If the driver can be a robot, output \"Robot\" in a single line. Otherwise, output \"Human\".You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).ExamplesInput1 5 2 4 1 2 3 5 3 1 4 3OutputHumanInput1 4 4 3 1 2 3 3 2 3 4 3 3 4 1 3 4 1 2OutputRobotNoteIn the first example it is clear that the driver used two different ways to get from crossroads $$$1$$$ to crossroads $$$3$$$. It must be a human.In the second example the driver always drives the cycle $$$1 \\\\to 2 \\\\to 3 \\\\to 4 \\\\to 1$$$ until he reaches destination.",
