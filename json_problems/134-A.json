Find all such indicesi, that thei-th element equals the arithmetic mean of allotherelements (that is all elements except for this one).InputThe first line contains the integern(2 ≤n≤ 2·105). The second line contains elements of the sequencea1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 1000). All the elements are positive integers.OutputPrint on the first line the number of the sought indices. Print on the second line the sought indices in the increasing order. All indices are integers from1ton.If the sought elements do not exist, then the first output line should contain number0. In this case you may either not print the second line or print an empty line.ExamplesInput51 2 3 4 5Output13Input450 50 50 50Output41 2 3 4",
