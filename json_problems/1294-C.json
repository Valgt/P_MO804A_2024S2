The $$$i$$$-th test case is given on a new line as one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer on it. Print \"NO\" if it is impossible to represent $$$n$$$ as $$$a \\\\cdot b \\\\cdot c$$$ for somedistinct integers$$$a, b, c$$$ such that $$$2 \\\\le a, b, c$$$.Otherwise, print \"YES\" andanypossible such representation.ExampleInput5 64 32 97 2 12345OutputYES 2 4 8  NO NO NO YES 3 5 823",
