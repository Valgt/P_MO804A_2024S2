Centroid Probabilitiestime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputConsider every tree (connected undirected acyclic graph) with $$$n$$$ vertices ($$$n$$$ is odd, vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$), and for each $$$2 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$ the $$$i$$$-th vertex is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index.For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$) calculate the number of trees for which the $$$i$$$-th vertex will be the centroid. The answer can be huge, output it modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.A vertex is called a centroid if its removal splits the tree into subtrees with at most $$$(n-1)/2$$$ vertices each.InputThe first line contains an odd integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n < 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n$$$ is odd) — the number of the vertices in the tree.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers in a single line, the $$$i$$$-th integer is the answer for the $$$i$$$-th vertex (modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$).ExamplesInput3Output1 1 0Input5Output10 10 4 0 0Input7Output276 276 132 36 0 0 0NoteExample $$$1$$$: there are two possible trees: with edges $$$(1-2)$$$, and $$$(1-3)$$$ — here the centroid is $$$1$$$; and with edges $$$(1-2)$$$, and $$$(2-3)$$$ — here the centroid is $$$2$$$.
