The stuffing types are numerated from 1 tom. Lavrenty knows that he hasaigrams left of thei-th stuffing. It takes exactlybigrams of stuffingiandcigrams of dough to cook a bun with thei-th stuffing. Such bun can be sold forditugriks.Also he can make bunswithout stuffings. Each of such buns requiresc0grams of dough and it can be sold ford0tugriks. So Lavrenty can cook any number of buns with different stuffings or without it unless he runs out of dough and the stuffings. Lavrenty throws away all excess material left after baking.Find the maximum number of tugriks Lavrenty can earn.InputThe first line contains4integersn,m,c0andd0(1 ≤n≤ 1000,1 ≤m≤ 10,1 ≤c0,d0≤ 100).
