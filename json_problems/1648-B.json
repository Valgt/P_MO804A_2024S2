Integral Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Let's call an arrayintegralif for any two, not necessarily different, numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ from this array, $$$x \\\\ge y$$$, the number $$$\\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{x}{y} \\\\right \\\\rfloor$$$ ($$$x$$$ divided by $$$y$$$ with rounding down) is also in this array.You are guaranteed that all numbers in $$$a$$$ do not exceed $$$c$$$. Your task is to check whether this array is integral.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\\\le c \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the size of $$$a$$$ and the limit for the numbers in the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le c$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.Let $$$N$$$ be the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases and $$$C$$$ be the sum of $$$c$$$ over all test cases. It is guaranteed that $$$N \\\\le 10^6$$$ and $$$C \\\\le 10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case printYesif the array is integral andNootherwise.ExamplesInput43 51 2 54 101 3 3 71 221 11OutputYes No No YesInput11 10000001000000OutputNoNoteIn the first test case it is easy to see that the array is integral:$$$\\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{1}{1} \\\\right \\\\rfloor = 1$$$, $$$a_1 = 1$$$, this number occurs in the arry$$$\\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2}{2} \\\\right \\\\rfloor = 1$$$$$$\\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{5}{5} \\\\right \\\\rfloor = 1$$$$$$\\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2}{1} \\\\right \\\\rfloor = 2$$$, $$$a_2 = 2$$$, this number occurs in the array$$$\\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{5}{1} \\\\right \\\\rfloor = 5$$$, $$$a_3 = 5$$$, this number occurs in the array$$$\\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{5}{2} \\\\right \\\\rfloor = 2$$$, $$$a_2 = 2$$$, this number occurs in the arrayThus, the condition is met and the array is integral.In the second test case it is enough to see that$$$\\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{7}{3} \\\\right \\\\rfloor = \\\\left \\\\lfloor 2\\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\right \\\\rfloor = 2$$$, this number is not in $$$a$$$, that's why it is not integral.In the third test case $$$\\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2}{2} \\\\right \\\\rfloor = 1$$$, but there is only $$$2$$$ in the array, that's why it is not integral.",
