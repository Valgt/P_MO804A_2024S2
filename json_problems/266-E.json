Your task is to quickly run the queries of two types:Assign valuexto all elements fromltorinclusive. After such query the values of the elements of arrayal,al+ 1, ...,arbecome equal tox.Calculate and print sum, wherekdoesn't exceed5. As the value of the sum can be rather large, you should print it modulo1000000007 (109+ 7).InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 105), showing, how many numbers are in the array and the number of queries, correspondingly. The second line containsnintegers:a1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤ 109) — the initial values of the array elements.Thenmqueries follow, one per line:The assign query has the following format: \"\", (1 ≤l≤r≤n; 0 ≤x≤ 109).The query to calculate the sum has the following format: \"\", (1 ≤l≤r≤n; 0 ≤k≤ 5).All numbers in the input are integers.OutputFor each query to calculate the sum print an integer — the required sum modulo1000000007 (109+ 7).ExamplesInput4 55 10 2 1? 1 2 1= 2 2 0? 2 4 3= 1 4 1? 1 4 5Output25431300Input3 11000000000 1000000000 1000000000? 1 3 0Output999999986",
