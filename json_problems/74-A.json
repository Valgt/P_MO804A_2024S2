The given rules slightly simplified, use the problem statement as a formal document.In the beginning of the round the contestants are divided into rooms. Each room contains exactlynparticipants. During the contest the participants are suggested to solve five problems,A,B,C,DandE. For each of these problem, depending on when the given problem was solved and whether it was solved at all, the participants receive some points. Besides, a contestant can perform hacks on other contestants. For each successful hack a contestant earns100points, for each unsuccessful hack a contestant loses50points. The number of points for every contestant is represented by the sum of points he has received from all his problems, including hacks.You are suggested to determine the leader for some room; the leader is a participant who has maximum points.InputThe first line contains an integern, which is the number of contestants in the room (1 ≤n≤ 50). The nextnlines contain the participants of a given room. Thei-th line has the format of \"handleiplusiminusiaibicidiei\" — it is the handle of a contestant, the number of successful hacks, the number of unsuccessful hacks and the number of points he has received from problemsA,B,C,D,Ecorrespondingly. The handle of each participant consists of Latin letters, digits and underscores and has the length from1to20characters. There are the following limitations imposed upon the numbers:0 ≤plusi,minusi≤ 50;150 ≤ai≤ 500orai= 0, if problemAis not solved;300 ≤bi≤ 1000orbi= 0, if problemBis not solved;450 ≤ci≤ 1500orci= 0, if problemCis not solved;600 ≤di≤ 2000ordi= 0, if problemDis not solved;750 ≤ei≤ 2500orei= 0, if problemEis not solved.All the numbers are integer. All the participants have different handles. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one leader in the room (i.e. there are no two participants with the maximal number of points).OutputPrint on the single line the handle of the room leader.ExamplesInput5Petr 3 1 490 920 1000 1200 0tourist 2 0 490 950 1100 1400 0Egor 7 0 480 900 950 0 1000c00lH4x0R 0 10 150 0 0 0 0some_participant 2 1 450 720 900 0 0OutputtouristNoteThe number of points that each participant from the example earns, are as follows:Petr—3860tourist—4140Egor—4030c00lH4x0R—- 350some_participant—2220Thus, the leader of the room istourist.",
