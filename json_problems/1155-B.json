Game with Telephone Numberstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA telephone number is a sequence ofexactly$$$11$$$ digits such that its first digit is8.Vasya and Petya are playing a game. Initially they have a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ ($$$n$$$ is odd) consisting of digits. Vasya makes the first move, then players alternate turns. In one move the playermustchoose a character and erase it from the current string. For example, if the current string1121, after the player's move it may be112,111or121. The game ends when the length of string $$$s$$$ becomes11. If the resulting string is a telephone number, Vasya wins, otherwise Petya wins.You have to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy (that is, if Vasya can win the game no matter which characters Petya chooses during his moves).InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$13 \\\\le n < 10^5$$$, $$$n$$$ is odd) â€” the length of string $$$s$$$.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$|s| = n$$$) consisting only of decimal digits.OutputIf Vasya has a strategy that guarantees him victory, printYES.Otherwise printNO.ExamplesInput13 8380011223344OutputYESInput15 807345619350641OutputNONoteIn the first example Vasya needs to erase the second character. Then Petya cannot erase a character from the remaining string880011223344so that it does not become a telephone number.In the second example after Vasya's turn Petya can erase one character character8. The resulting string can't be a telephone number, because there is no digit8at all.",
