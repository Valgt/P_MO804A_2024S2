You have to find $$$4$$$positiveintegers $$$a, b, c, d$$$ such that$$$a + b + c + d = n$$$, and$$$\\\\gcd(a, b) = \\\\operatorname{lcm}(c, d)$$$.If there are several possible answers you can output any of them. It is possible to show that the answer always exists.In this problem $$$\\\\gcd(a, b)$$$ denotes thegreatest common divisorof $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and $$$\\\\operatorname{lcm}(c, d)$$$ denotes theleast common multipleof $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.Each test case contains a single line with integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the sum of $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, and $$$d$$$.OutputFor each test case output $$$4$$$positiveintegers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ such that $$$a + b + c + d = n$$$ and $$$\\\\gcd(a, b) = \\\\operatorname{lcm}(c, d)$$$.ExampleInput5478910Output1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 4 2 1 3 5 1 1NoteIn the first test case $$$\\\\gcd(1, 1) = \\\\operatorname{lcm}(1, 1) = 1$$$, $$$1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$$$.In the second test case $$$\\\\gcd(2, 2) = \\\\operatorname{lcm}(2, 1) = 2$$$, $$$2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7$$$.In the third test case $$$\\\\gcd(2, 2) = \\\\operatorname{lcm}(2, 2) = 2$$$, $$$2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8$$$.In the fourth test case $$$\\\\gcd(2, 4) = \\\\operatorname{lcm}(2, 1) = 2$$$, $$$2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 9$$$.In the fifth test case $$$\\\\gcd(3, 5) = \\\\operatorname{lcm}(1, 1) = 1$$$, $$$3 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 10$$$.",
