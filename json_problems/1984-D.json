Count the number of nonempty strings $$$t \\\\neq$$$ \"$$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$\" such that it is possible to partition$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$ $$$s$$$ into some substrings satisfying the following conditions:each substring either equals $$$t$$$ or \"$$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$\", andat least one substring equals $$$t$$$.$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$ Apartitionof a string $$$s$$$ is an ordered sequence of some $$$k$$$ strings $$$t_1, t_2, \\\\ldots, t_k$$$ (calledsubstrings) such that $$$t_1 + t_2 + \\\\ldots + t_k = s$$$, where $$$+$$$ represents the concatenation operation.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin characters ($$$2 \\\\leq |s| \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of nonempty strings $$$t \\\\neq$$$ \"$$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$\" that satisfy all constraints.ExampleInput8aaaaababacabacbaaabaaabitsetababbaaaabbbyearnineteeneightyfourOutput4 4 1 16 1 2 3 1NoteIn the first test case, $$$t$$$ can be \"$$$\\\\texttt{aa}$$$\", \"$$$\\\\texttt{aaa}$$$\", \"$$$\\\\texttt{aaaa}$$$\", or the full string.In the second test case, $$$t$$$ can be \"$$$\\\\texttt{b}$$$\", \"$$$\\\\texttt{bab}$$$\", \"$$$\\\\texttt{ba}$$$\", or the full string.In the third test case, the only such $$$t$$$ is the full string.",
