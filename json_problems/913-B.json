A rooted tree has one special vertex called the root. All edges are directed from the root. Vertexuis called achildof vertexvand vertexvis called aparentof vertexuif there exists a directed edge fromvtou. A vertex is called aleafif it doesn't have children and has a parent.Let's call a rooted tree aspruceif its every non-leaf vertex has at least3leaf children. You are given a rooted tree, check whether it's a spruce.The definition of a rooted tree can be foundhere.InputThe first line contains one integern— the number of vertices in the tree (3 ≤n≤ 1 000). Each of the nextn- 1lines contains one integerpi(1 ≤i≤n- 1) — the index of the parent of thei+ 1-th vertex (1 ≤pi≤i).Vertex1is the root. It's guaranteed that the root has at least2children.OutputPrint \"Yes\" if the tree is a spruce and \"No\" otherwise.ExamplesInput4111OutputYesInput7111222OutputNoInput81111333OutputYesNoteThe first example:The second example:It is not a spruce, because the non-leaf vertex1has only2leaf children.The third example:",
