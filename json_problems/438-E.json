The Child and Binary Treetime limit per test7 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutOur child likes computer science very much, especially he likes binary trees.Consider the sequence ofndistinct positive integers:c1,c2, ...,cn. The child calls a vertex-weighted rooted binary treegoodif and only if for every vertexv, the weight ofvis in the set{c1,c2, ...,cn}. Also our child thinks that theweightof a vertex-weighted tree is the sum of all vertices' weights.Given an integerm, can you for alls(1 ≤s≤m)calculate the number of good vertex-weighted rooted binary trees with weights? Please, check the samples for better understanding what trees are considered different.We only want to know the answer modulo998244353(7 × 17 × 223+ 1, a prime number).InputThe first line contains two integersn,m(1 ≤n≤ 105; 1 ≤m≤ 105). The second line containsnspace-separated pairwise distinct integersc1,c2, ...,cn.(1 ≤ci≤ 105).OutputPrintmlines, each line containing a single integer.
