Integer Diversitytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$. You choose any subset of the given numbers (possibly, none or all numbers) and negate these numbers (i.Â e. change $$$x \\\\to (-x)$$$). What is the maximum number of different values in the array you can achieve?InputThe first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$): the number of test cases.The next lines contain the description of the $$$t$$$ test cases, two lines per a test case.In the first line you are given one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$$$): the number of integers in the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-100 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 100$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of different elements in the array that you can achieve negating numbers in the array.ExampleInput3 4 1 1 2 2 3 1 2 3 2 0 0Output4 3 1NoteIn the first example we can, for example, negate the first and the last numbers, achieving the array $$$[-1, 1, 2, -2]$$$ with four different values.In the second example all three numbers are already different.In the third example negation does not change anything.",
