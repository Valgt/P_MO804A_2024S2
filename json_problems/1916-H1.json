The only differences between the two versions of this problem are the constraints on $$$k$$$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.You are given integers $$$n$$$, $$$p$$$ and $$$k$$$. $$$p$$$ is guaranteed to be a prime number.For each $$$r$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$, find the number of $$$n \\\\times n$$$ matrices $$$A$$$ of the field$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ of integers modulo $$$p$$$ such that the rank$$$^\\\\ddagger$$$ of $$$A$$$ is exactly $$$r$$$. Since these values are big, you are only required to output them modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.$$$^\\\\dagger$$$https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)$$$^\\\\ddagger$$$https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra)InputThe first line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$p$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$, $$$2 \\\\leq p < 998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$, $$$0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 5000$$$).It is guaranteed that $$$p$$$ is a prime number.OutputOutput $$$k+1$$$ integers, the answers for each $$$r$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.ExamplesInput3 2 3Output1 49 294 168Input1 51549919 2Output1 51549918 0",
