There arencities numbered from1tonin his country. City1is the capital of A. Also there aremroads connecting the cities. One can go from cityuitovi(and vise versa) using thei-th road, the length of this road isxi. Finally, there arektrain routes in the country. One can use thei-th train route to go from capital of the country to citysi(and vise versa), the length of this route isyi.Jzzhu doesn't want to waste the money of the country, so he is going to close some of the train routes. Please tell Jzzhu the maximum number of the train routes which can be closed under the following condition: the length of the shortest path from every city to the capital mustn't change.InputThe first line contains three integersn,m,k(2 ≤n≤ 105; 1 ≤m≤ 3·105; 1 ≤k≤ 105).Each of the nextmlines contains three integersui,vi,xi(1 ≤ui,vi≤n;ui≠vi; 1 ≤xi≤ 109).Each of the nextklines contains two integerssiandyi(2 ≤si≤n; 1 ≤yi≤ 109).It is guaranteed that there is at least one way from every city to the capital. Note, that there can be multiple roads between two cities. Also, there can be multiple routes going to the same city from the capital.OutputOutput a single integer representing the maximum number of the train routes which can be closed.ExamplesInput5 5 31 2 12 3 21 3 33 4 41 5 53 54 55 5Output2Input2 2 31 2 22 1 32 12 22 3Output2",
