Dasha and Nightmarestime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDasha, an excellent student, is studying at the best mathematical lyceum in the country. Recently, a mysterious stranger brought $$$n$$$ words consisting of small latin letters $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_n$$$ to the lyceum. Since that day, Dasha has been tormented bynightmares.Consider some pair of integers $$$\\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le j \\\\le n$$$).A nightmareis a string for which it is true:It is obtained by concatenation $$$s_{i}s_{j}$$$;Its length isodd;The number of different letters in it isexactly$$$25$$$;The number of occurrences of each letter that is in the word isodd.For example, if $$$s_i=$$$ \"abcdefg\" and $$$s_j=$$$ \"ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\", the pair $$$\\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle$$$ creates anightmare.Dasha will stop havingnightmaresif she counts their number. There are too manynightmares, so Dasha needs your help. Count the number of differentnightmares.Nightmaresare called different if the corresponding pairs $$$\\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle$$$ are different. The pairs $$$\\\\langle i_1, j_1 \\\\rangle$$$ and $$$\\\\langle i_2, j_2 \\\\rangle$$$ are called different if $$$i_1 \\\\neq i_2$$$or$$$j_1 \\\\neq j_2$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of words.The following $$$n$$$ lines contain the words $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_n$$$, consisting of small latin letters.It is guaranteed that the total length of words does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^6$$$.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of differentnightmares.ExampleInput10ftlabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabcdeffghijkllmnopqrsttuvwxyffftlaabbccddeeffgghhiijjkkllmmnnooppqqrrssttuuvvwwxxyythedevidbcdefghhiiiijklmnopqrsuwxyzgorillasilverbackabcdefgijklmnopqrstuvwxyzOutput5NoteIn the first test,nightmaresare created by pairs $$$\\\\langle 1, 3 \\\\rangle$$$, $$$\\\\langle 2, 5 \\\\rangle$$$, $$$\\\\langle 3, 4 \\\\rangle$$$, $$$\\\\langle 6, 7 \\\\rangle$$$, $$$\\\\langle 9, 10 \\\\rangle$$$.",
