Find some number that satisfies both of them.Your task is: given thenandtprint an integer strictly larger than zero consisting ofndigits that is divisible byt. If such number doesn't exist, print- 1.InputThe single line contains two numbers,nandt(1 ≤n≤ 100,2 ≤t≤ 10) — the length of the number and the number it should be divisible by.OutputPrint one such positive number without leading zeroes, — the answer to the problem, or- 1, if such number doesn't exist. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput3 2Output712",
