So he decided to repeat the operation of lengthening numberantimes.One operation of lengthening a number means adding exactly one digit to the number (in the decimal notation) to the right provided that the resulting number is divisible by Vasya's numberb. If it is impossible to obtain the number which is divisible byb, then the lengthening operation cannot be performed.Your task is to help Vasya and print the number he can get after applying the lengthening operation to numberantimes.InputThe first line contains three integers:a,b,n(1 ≤a,b,n≤ 105).OutputIn a single line print the integer without leading zeros, which Vasya can get when he applies the lengthening operations to numberantimes. If no such number exists, then print number -1. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput5 4 5Output524848Input12 11 1Output121Input260 150 10Output-1",
