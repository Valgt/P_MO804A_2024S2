Water Lilytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWhile sailing on a boat, Inessa noticed a beautiful water lily flower above the lake's surface. She came closer and it turned out that the lily was exactly $$$H$$$ centimeters above the water surface. Inessa grabbed the flower and sailed the distance of $$$L$$$ centimeters. Exactly at this point the flower touched the water surface.Suppose that the lily grows at some point $$$A$$$ on the lake bottom, and its stem is always a straight segment with one endpoint at point $$$A$$$. Also suppose that initially the flower was exactly above the point $$$A$$$, i.e. its stem was vertical. Can you determine the depth of the lake at point $$$A$$$?InputThe only line contains two integers $$$H$$$ and $$$L$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le H < L \\\\le 10^{6}$$$).OutputPrint a single number — the depth of the lake at point $$$A$$$. The absolute or relative error should not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.Formally, let your answer be $$$A$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$B$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\\\\frac{|A - B|}{\\\\max{(1, |B|)}} \\\\le 10^{-6}$$$.ExamplesInput1 2Output1.5000000000000Input3 5Output2.6666666666667",
