AND oracletime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputImplement a quantum oracle on $$$N$$$ qubits which implements the following function: $$$$$$f(\\\\vec{x}) = x_0 \\\\wedge x_1 \\\\wedge \\\\dotsb \\\\wedge x_{N-1}$$$$$$You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:an array of $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le N \\\\le 8$$$) qubits $$$x$$$ in an arbitrary state (input register),a qubit $$$y$$$ in an arbitrary state (output qubit),and performs a transformation $$$|x\\\\rangle|y\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow |x\\\\rangle|y \\\\oplus f(x)\\\\rangle$$$. The operation doesn't have an output; its \"output\" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit) : Unit {body (...) {// your code here}adjoint auto;}}",
