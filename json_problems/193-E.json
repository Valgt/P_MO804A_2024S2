This list is infinite, it starts with numbers0and1. Each number in the list, apart from the first two, is a sum of previous two modulo1013. That is, John's list is made from the Fibonacci numbers' list by replacing each number there by the remainder when divided by1013.John got interested in numberf(0 ≤f< 1013) and now wants to find its first occurrence in the list given above. Help John and find the number of the first occurence of numberfin the list or otherwise state that numberfdoes not occur in the list.The numeration in John's list starts from zero. There, the0-th position is the number0, the1-st position is the number1, the2-nd position is the number1, the3-rd position is the number2, the4-th position is the number3and so on. Thus, the beginning of the list looks like this:0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...InputThe first line contains the single integerf(0 ≤f< 1013) — the number, which position in the list we should find.Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.OutputPrint a single number — the number of the first occurrence of the given number in John's list. If this number doesn't occur in John's list, print -1.ExamplesInput13Output7Input377Output14",
