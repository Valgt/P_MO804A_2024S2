Division by Two and Permutationtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You can perform operations on it.In one operation you can replace any element of the array $$$a_i$$$ with $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{a_i}{2} \\\\rfloor$$$, that is, by an integer part of dividing $$$a_i$$$ by $$$2$$$ (rounding down).See if you can apply the operation some number of times (possible $$$0$$$) to make the array $$$a$$$ become a permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ —that is, so that it contains all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, each exactly once.For example, if $$$a = [1, 8, 25, 2]$$$, $$$n = 4$$$, then the answer is yes. You could do the following:Replace $$$8$$$ with $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{8}{2} \\\\rfloor = 4$$$, then $$$a = [1, 4, 25, 2]$$$.Replace $$$25$$$ with $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{25}{2} \\\\rfloor = 12$$$, then $$$a = [1, 4, 12, 2]$$$.Replace $$$12$$$ with $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{12}{2} \\\\rfloor = 6$$$, then $$$a = [1, 4, 6, 2]$$$.Replace $$$6$$$ with $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{6}{2} \\\\rfloor = 3$$$, then $$$a = [1, 4, 3, 2]$$$.InputThe first line of input data contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) —the number of test cases.Each test case contains exactly two lines. The first one contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$), the second one contains integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, output on a separate line:YESif you can make the array $$$a$$$ become a permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$,NOotherwise.You can outputYESandNOin any case (for example, stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput641 8 25 221 199 8 3 4 2 7 1 5 638 2 1424 7 16 7522 6 22 4 22OutputYES NO YES NO NO YESNoteThe first test case is explained in the text of the problem statement.In the second test case, it is not possible to get a permutation.",
