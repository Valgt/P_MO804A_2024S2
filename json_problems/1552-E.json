Colors and Intervalstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe numbers $$$1, \\\\, 2, \\\\, \\\\dots, \\\\, n \\\\cdot k$$$ are colored with $$$n$$$ colors. These colors are indexed by $$$1, \\\\, 2, \\\\, \\\\dots, \\\\, n$$$. For each $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$, there are exactly $$$k$$$ numbers colored with color $$$i$$$.Let $$$[a, \\\\, b]$$$ denote the interval of integers between $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ inclusive, that is, the set $$$\\\\{a, \\\\, a + 1, \\\\, \\\\dots, \\\\, b\\\\}$$$. You must choose $$$n$$$ intervals $$$[a_1, \\\\, b_1], \\\\, [a_2, \\\\, b_2], \\\\, \\\\dots, [a_n, \\\\, b_n]$$$ such that:for each $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$, it holds $$$1 \\\\le a_i < b_i \\\\le n \\\\cdot k$$$;for each $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$, the numbers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ are colored with color $$$i$$$;each number $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le n \\\\cdot k$$$ belongs to at most $$$\\\\left\\\\lceil \\\\frac{n}{k - 1} \\\\right\\\\rceil$$$ intervals.One can show that such a family of intervals always exists under the given constraints.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$, $$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le 100$$$) â€” the number of colors and the number of occurrences of each color.The second line contains $$$n \\\\cdot k$$$ integers $$$c_1, \\\\, c_2, \\\\, \\\\dots, \\\\, c_{nk}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c_j \\\\le n$$$), where $$$c_j$$$ is the color of number $$$j$$$. It is guaranteed that, for each $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$, it holds $$$c_j = i$$$ for exactly $$$k$$$ distinct indices $$$j$$$.OutputOutput $$$n$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain the two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$.If there are multiple valid choices of the intervals, output any.ExamplesInput4 3 2 4 3 1 1 4 2 3 2 1 3 4Output4 5 1 7 8 11 6 12Input1 2 1 1Output1 2Input3 3 3 1 2 3 2 1 2 1 3Output6 8 3 7 1 4Input2 3 2 1 1 1 2 2Output2 3 5 6NoteIn thefirst sample, each number can be contained in at most $$$\\\\left\\\\lceil \\\\frac{4}{3 - 1} \\\\right\\\\rceil = 2$$$ intervals.
