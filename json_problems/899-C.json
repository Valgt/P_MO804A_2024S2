He wants to split these integers intwo non-emptygroups in such a way that the absolute difference of sums of integers in each group is as small as possible.Help Petya to split the integers. Each ofnintegers should be exactly in one group.InputThe first line contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 60 000) — the number of integers Petya has.OutputPrint the smallest possible absolute difference in the first line.In the second line print the size of the first group, followed by the integers in that group. You can print these integers in arbitrary order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput4Output02 1 4Input2Output11 1NoteIn the first example you have to put integers1and4in the first group, and2and3in the second. This way the sum in each group is5, and the absolute difference is0.In the second example there are only two integers, and since both groups should be non-empty, you have to put one integer in the first group and one in the second. This way the absolute difference of sums of integers in each group is1.",
