Multiples and Power Differencestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a matrix $$$a$$$ consisting of positive integers. It has $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns.Construct a matrix $$$b$$$ consisting of positive integers. It should have the same size as $$$a$$$, and the following conditions should be met:$$$1 \\\\le b_{i,j} \\\\le 10^6$$$;$$$b_{i,j}$$$ is a multiple of $$$a_{i,j}$$$;the absolute value of the difference between numbers in any adjacent pair of cells (two cells that share the same side) in $$$b$$$ is equal to $$$k^4$$$ for some integer $$$k \\\\ge 1$$$ ($$$k$$$ is not necessarily the same for all pairs, it is own for each pair).We can show that the answer always exists.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n,m \\\\le 500$$$).Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers. The $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$i$$$-th line is $$$a_{i,j}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_{i,j} \\\\le 16$$$).OutputThe output should contain $$$n$$$ lines each containing $$$m$$$ integers. The $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$i$$$-th line should be $$$b_{i,j}$$$.ExamplesInput2 2 1 2 2 3Output1 2 2 3Input2 3 16 16 16 16 16 16Output16 32 48 32 48 64Input2 2 3 11 12 8Output327 583 408 664NoteIn the first example, the matrix $$$a$$$ can be used as the matrix $$$b$$$, because the absolute value of the difference between numbers in any adjacent pair of cells is $$$1 = 1^4$$$.In the third example:$$$327$$$ is a multiple of $$$3$$$, $$$583$$$ is a multiple of $$$11$$$, $$$408$$$ is a multiple of $$$12$$$, $$$664$$$ is a multiple of $$$8$$$;$$$|408 - 327| = 3^4$$$, $$$|583 - 327| = 4^4$$$, $$$|664 - 408| = 4^4$$$, $$$|664 - 583| = 3^4$$$.",
