Berlyand opposition, funded from a neighboring state, has organized a demonstration in Berland capital Bertown. Through the work of intelligence we know that the demonstrations are planned to last forkdays.Fortunately, Berland has a special police unit, which can save the country. It has exactlynsoldiers numbered from1ton. Berland general, the commander of the detachment, must schedule the detachment's work in these difficultkdays. In each of these days, the general must send a certain number of police officers to disperse riots. Since the detachment is large and the general is not very smart, he can only select a set of all soldiers numbered fromltor, inclusive, wherelandrare selected arbitrarily.Now the general has exactly two problems. First, he cannot send the same group twice — then soldiers get bored and they rebel. Second, not all soldiers are equally reliable. Every soldier has a reliability ofai. The reliability of the detachment is counted as the sum of reliabilities of soldiers in it. The reliability of a single soldier can be negative, then when you include him in the detachment, he will only spoil things. The general is distinguished by his great greed and shortsightedness, so each day he sends to the dissolution the most reliable group of soldiers possible (that is, of all the groups that have not been sent yet).The Berland Government has decided to know what would be the minimum reliability of the detachment, sent to disperse the demonstrations during thesekdays. The general himself can not cope with such a difficult task. Help him to not embarrass himself in front of his superiors!InputThe first line contains two integersnandk— the number of soldiers in the detachment and the number of times somebody goes on duty.The second line containsnspace-separated integersai, their absolute value doesn't exceed109— the soldiers' reliabilities.Please do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++, it is preferred to usecin,coutstreams of the%I64dspecifier.OutputPrint a single number — the sought minimum reliability of the groups that go on duty during thesekdays.ExamplesInput3 41 4 2Output4Input4 62 -1 2 -1Output1Input8 101 -2 3 -4 5 -6 7 -8Output2",
