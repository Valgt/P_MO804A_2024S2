Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the followingndays. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that ini-th daykiproducts will be put up for sale and exactlyliclients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose anyfdays fromnnext for sell-outs. On each offchosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if oni-th day shop planned to put up for salekiproducts and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep2·kiproducts. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.Noora's task is to choosefdays to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.InputThe first line contains two integersnandf(1 ≤n≤ 105, 0 ≤f≤n)denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.Each line of the followingnsubsequent lines contains two integerski,li(0 ≤ki,li≤ 109)denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on thei-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop oni-th day.OutputPrint a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.ExamplesInput4 22 13 52 31 5Output10Input4 10 20 33 50 6Output5NoteIn the first example we can choose days with numbers2and4for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to[2, 6, 2, 2]respectively. So on the first day shop will sell1product, on the second —5, on the third —2, on the fourth —2. In total1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10product units.In the second example it is possible to sell5products, if you choose third day for sell-out.",
