The cost of dinner in the restaurant at the intersection of thei-th street and thej-th avenue iscij.Jack and Emma decide to choose the restaurant in the following way. Firstly Emma chooses the street to dinner and then Jack chooses the avenue. Emma and Jack makes their choice optimally: Emma wants to maximize the cost of the dinner, Jack wants to minimize it.
