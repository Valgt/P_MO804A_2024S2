Beautiful fountains rowstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputButler Ostin wants to show Arkady that rows of odd number of fountains are beautiful, while rows of even number of fountains are not.The butler wants to show Arkadyngardens. Each garden is a row ofmcells, thei-th garden has one fountain in each of the cells betweenliandriinclusive, and there are no more fountains in that garden. The issue is that some of the gardens contain even number of fountains, it is wrong to show them to Arkady.Ostin wants to choose two integersa≤band show only part of each of the gardens that starts at cellaand ends at cellb. Of course, only such segments suit Ostin that each garden has either zero or odd number of fountains on this segment. Also, it is necessary that at least one garden has at least one fountain on the segment fromatob.Help Ostin to find the total length of all such segments, i.e. sum up the value(b-a+ 1)for each suitable pair(a,b).InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 2·105) — the number of gardens and the length of each garden.nlines follow. Thei-th of these lines contains two integersliandri(1 ≤li≤ri≤m) — the bounds of the segment that contains fountains in thei-th garden.OutputPrint one integer: the total length of all suitable segments.ExamplesInput1 52 4Output23Input3 62 43 64 4Output19NoteIn the first example the following pairs suit Ostin:(a,b):(1, 2),(1, 4),(1, 5),(2, 2),(2, 4),(2, 5),(3, 3),(4, 4),(4, 5).In the second example the following pairs suit Ostin:(a,b):(1, 2),(1, 5),(2, 2),(2, 5),(3, 3),(4, 4),(4, 6),(5, 5),(6, 6).",
