Denote this permutation asp. Thei-th element ofpwill be denoted aspi. For all pairs of distinct integersi,jbetween1andn, he wrote the numberai,j=min(pi,pj). He writesai,i= 0for all integerifrom1ton.Bob gave you all the values ofai,jthat he wrote down. Your job is to reconstruct any permutation that could have generated these values. The input will be formed so that it is guaranteed that there is at least one solution that is consistent with the information given.InputThe first line of the input will contain a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 50).The nextnlines will contain the values ofai,j. Thej-th number on thei-th line will representai,j. Thei-th number on thei-th line will be0. It's guaranteed thatai,j=aj,iand there is at least one solution consistent with the information given.OutputPrintnspace separated integers, which represents a permutation that could have generated these values. If there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput20 11 0Output2 1Input50 2 2 1 22 0 4 1 32 4 0 1 31 1 1 0 12 3 3 1 0Output2 5 4 1 3NoteIn the first case, the answer can be{1, 2}or{2, 1}.In the second case, another possible answer is{2, 4, 5, 1, 3}.",
