Ivan knows that the array is sorted in the non-decreasing order.Ivan wrote out integers2a1, 2a2, ..., 2anon a piece of paper. Now he wonders, what minimum number of integers of form2b(b≥ 0)need to be added to the piece of paper so that the sum of all integers written on the paper equalled2v- 1for some integerv(v≥ 0).Help Ivan, find the required quantity of numbers.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105). The second input line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤ 2·109). It is guaranteed thata1≤a2≤ ... ≤an.OutputPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput40 1 1 1Output0Input13Output3NoteIn the first sample you do not need to add anything, the sum of numbers already equals23- 1 = 7.In the second sample you need to add numbers20, 21, 22.",
