Game of Robotstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn late autumn eveningnrobots gathered in the cheerful company of friends. Each robot has a unique identifier — an integer from1to109.At some moment, robots decided to play the game \"Snowball\". Below there are the rules of this game. First, all robots stand in a row. Then the first robot says his identifier. After that the second robot says the identifier of the first robot and then says his own identifier. Then the third robot says the identifier of the first robot, then says the identifier of the second robot and after that says his own. This process continues from left to right until then-th robot says his identifier.Your task is to determine thek-th identifier to be pronounced.InputThe first line contains two positive integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 100 000,1 ≤k≤min(2·109,n·(n+ 1) / 2).The second line contains the sequenceid1,id2, ...,idn(1 ≤idi≤ 109) — identifiers of roborts. It is guaranteed that all identifiers are different.OutputPrint thek-th pronounced identifier (assume that the numeration starts from1).ExamplesInput2 21 2Output1Input4 510 4 18 3Output4NoteIn the first sample identifiers of robots will be pronounced in the following order:1,1,2. Ask= 2, the answer equals to1.In the second test case identifiers of robots will be pronounced in the following order:10,10,4,10,4,18,10,4,18,3. Ask= 5, the answer equals to4.",
