Jeff and Bracketstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutJeff loves regular bracket sequences.Today Jeff is going to take a piece of paper and write out the regular bracket sequence, consisting ofnmbrackets. Let's number all brackets of this sequence from0tonm-1from left to right. Jeff knows that he is going to spendaimodnliters of ink on thei-th bracket of the sequence if he paints it opened andbimodnliters if he paints it closed.You've got sequencesa,band numbersn,m. What minimum amount of ink will Jeff need to paint a regular bracket sequence of lengthnm?Operationxmodymeans taking the remainder after dividing numberxby numbery.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 20; 1 ≤m≤ 107;mis even). The next line containsnintegers:a0,a1,...,an- 1(1 ≤ai≤ 10). The next line containsnintegers:b0,b1,...,bn- 1(1 ≤bi≤ 10). The numbers are separated by spaces.OutputIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum required amount of ink in liters.ExamplesInput2 61 22 1Output12Input1 1000000023Output25000000NoteIn the first test the optimal sequence is:()()()()()(), the required number of ink liters is12.",
