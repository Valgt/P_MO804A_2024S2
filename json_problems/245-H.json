Queries for Number of Palindromestime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYou've got a strings=s1s2...s|s|of length|s|, consisting of lowercase English letters. There also areqqueries, each query is described by two integersli,ri(1 ≤li≤ri≤ |s|). The answer to the query is the number of substrings of strings[li...ri], which are palindromes.Strings[l...r] =slsl+ 1...sr(1 ≤l≤r≤ |s|)is asubstringof strings=s1s2...s|s|.Stringtis called apalindrome, if it reads the same from left to right and from right to left. Formally, ift=t1t2...t|t|=t|t|t|t| - 1...t1.InputThe first line contains strings(1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000). The second line contains a single integerq(1 ≤q≤ 106)— the number of queries. Nextqlines contain the queries. Thei-th of these lines contains two space-separated integersli,ri(1 ≤li≤ri≤ |s|)— the description of thei-th query.It is guaranteed that the given string consists only of lowercase English letters.OutputPrintqintegers — the answers to the queries. Print the answers in the order, in which the queries are given in the input. Separate the printed numbers by whitespaces.ExamplesInputcaaaba51 11 42 34 64 5Output17342NoteConsider the fourth query in the first test case. Strings[4... 6]= «aba». Its palindrome substrings are: «a», «b», «a», «aba».",
