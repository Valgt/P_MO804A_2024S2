Little Elephant and Inversionstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe Little Elephant has arraya, consisting ofnpositive integers, indexed from 1 ton. Let's denote the number with indexiasai.The Little Elephant wants to count, how many pairs of integerslandrare there, such that1 ≤l<r≤nand sequenceb=a1a2...alarar+ 1...anhas no more thankinversions.Aninversionin sequencebis a pair of elements of the sequenceb, that change their relative order after a stable sorting of the sequence. In other words, an inversion is a pair of integersiandj, such that1 ≤i<j≤ |b|andbi>bj, where|b|is the length of sequenceb, andbjis itsj-th element.Help the Little Elephant and count the number of the described pairs.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(2 ≤n≤ 105, 0 ≤k≤ 1018)— the size of arrayaand the maximum allowed number of inversions respectively. The next line containsnpositive integers, separated by single spaces,a1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109)— elements of arraya.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.OutputIn a single line print a single number — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput3 11 3 2Output3Input5 21 3 2 1 7Output6",
