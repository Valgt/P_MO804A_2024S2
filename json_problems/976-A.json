Here are some examples: \"0\", \"10\", \"1001\".You are given acorrectstrings.You can perform two different operations on this string:swap any pair of adjacent characters (for example, \"101\"\"110\");replace \"11\" with \"1\" (for example, \"110\"\"10\").Letval(s)be such a number thatsis its binary representation.Correctstringais less than some othercorrectstringbiffval(a) <val(b).Your task is to find the minimumcorrectstring that you can obtain from the given one using the operations described above. You can use these operations any number of times in any order (or even use no operations at all).InputThe first line contains integer numbern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the length of strings.The second line contains the stringsconsisting of characters \"0\" and \"1\". It is guaranteed that the stringsiscorrect.OutputPrint one string — the minimumcorrectstring that you can obtain from the given one.ExamplesInput41001Output100Input11Output1NoteIn the first example you can obtain the answer by the following sequence of operations: \"1001\"\"1010\"\"1100\"\"100\".In the second example you can't obtain smaller answer no matter what operations you use.",
