Sets and Uniontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have $$$n$$$ sets of integers $$$S_{1}, S_{2}, \\\\ldots, S_{n}$$$. We call a set $$$S$$$attainable, if it is possible to choose some (possibly, none) of the sets $$$S_{1}, S_{2}, \\\\ldots, S_{n}$$$ so that $$$S$$$ is equal to their union$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$. If you choose none of $$$S_{1}, S_{2}, \\\\ldots, S_{n}$$$, their union is an empty set.Find the maximum number of elements in an attainable $$$S$$$ such that $$$S \\\\neq S_{1} \\\\cup S_{2} \\\\cup \\\\ldots \\\\cup S_{n}$$$.$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$ The union of sets $$$A_1, A_2, \\\\ldots, A_k$$$ is defined as the set of elements present in at least one of these sets. It is denoted by $$$A_1 \\\\cup A_2 \\\\cup \\\\ldots \\\\cup A_k$$$. For example, $$$\\\\{2, 4, 6\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\{2, 3\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\{3, 6, 7\\\\} = \\\\{2, 3, 4, 6, 7\\\\}$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$).The following $$$n$$$ lines describe the sets $$$S_1, S_2, \\\\ldots, S_n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th of these lines contains an integer $$$k_{i}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k_{i} \\\\le 50$$$) — the number of elements in $$$S_{i}$$$, followed by $$$k_{i}$$$ integers $$$s_{i, 1}, s_{i, 2}, \\\\ldots, s_{i, k_{i}}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le s_{i, 1} < s_{i, 2} < \\\\ldots < s_{i, k_{i}} \\\\le 50$$$) — the elements of $$$S_{i}$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the maximum number of elements in an attainable $$$S$$$ such that $$$S \\\\neq S_{1} \\\\cup S_{2} \\\\cup \\\\ldots \\\\cup S_{n}$$$.ExampleInput433 1 2 32 4 52 3 444 1 2 3 43 2 5 63 3 5 63 4 5 651 13 3 6 101 92 1 33 5 8 912 4 28Output4 5 6 0NoteIn the first test case, $$$S = S_{1} \\\\cup S_{3} = \\\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\\\}$$$ is the largest attainable set not equal to $$$S_1 \\\\cup S_2 \\\\cup S_3 = \\\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\\\}$$$.In the second test case, we can pick $$$S = S_{2} \\\\cup S_{3} \\\\cup S_{4} = \\\\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\\\}$$$.In the third test case, we can pick $$$S = S_{2} \\\\cup S_{5} = S_{2} \\\\cup S_{3} \\\\cup S_{5} = \\\\{3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10\\\\}$$$.In the fourth test case, the only attainable set is $$$S = \\\\varnothing$$$.",
