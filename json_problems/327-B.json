That is an inequalityai<ajholds for any two indicesi,j(i<j).For any two indicesiandj(i<j),ajmustnotbe divisible byai.Iahub is in trouble, so he asks you for help. Find a Hungry sequence withnelements.InputThe input contains a single integer:n(1 ≤n≤ 105).OutputOutput a line that containsnspace-separated integersa1a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 107), representing a possible Hungry sequence.
