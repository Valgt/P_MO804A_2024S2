Strange Functionstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's define a function $$$f(x)$$$ ($$$x$$$ is a positive integer) as follows: write all digits of the decimal representation of $$$x$$$ backwards, then get rid of the leading zeroes. For example, $$$f(321) = 123$$$, $$$f(120) = 21$$$, $$$f(1000000) = 1$$$, $$$f(111) = 111$$$.Let's define another function $$$g(x) = \\\\dfrac{x}{f(f(x))}$$$ ($$$x$$$ is a positive integer as well).Your task is the following: for the given positive integer $$$n$$$, calculate the number of different values of $$$g(x)$$$ among all numbers $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le n$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n < 10^{100}$$$). This integer is given without leading zeroes.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the number of different values of the function $$$g(x)$$$, if $$$x$$$ can be any integer from $$$[1, n]$$$.ExampleInput5 4 37 998244353 1000000007 12345678901337426966631415Output1 2 9 10 26NoteExplanations for the two first test cases of the example:if $$$n = 4$$$, then for every integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le n$$$, $$$\\\\dfrac{x}{f(f(x))} = 1$$$;if $$$n = 37$$$, then for some integers $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le n$$$, $$$\\\\dfrac{x}{f(f(x))} = 1$$$ (for example, if $$$x = 23$$$, $$$f(f(x)) = 23$$$,$$$\\\\dfrac{x}{f(f(x))} = 1$$$); and for other values of $$$x$$$, $$$\\\\dfrac{x}{f(f(x))} = 10$$$ (for example, if $$$x = 30$$$, $$$f(f(x)) = 3$$$, $$$\\\\dfrac{x}{f(f(x))} = 10$$$). So, there are two different values of $$$g(x)$$$.",
