Red-Green Towerstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThere arerred andggreen blocks for construction of thered-greentower.Red-greentower can be built following next rules:Red-green tower is consisting of some number of levels;Let the red-green tower consist ofnlevels, then the first level of this tower should consist ofnblocks, second level — ofn- 1blocks, the third one — ofn- 2blocks, and so on — the last level of such tower should consist of the one block. In other words, each successive level should contain one block less than the previous one;Each level of the red-green tower should contain blocks of the same color.Lethbe the maximum possible number of levels of red-green tower, that can be built out ofrred andggreen blocks meeting the rules above. The task is to determine how many different red-green towers havinghlevels can be built out of the available blocks.Two red-green towers are considered different if there exists some level, that consists of red blocks in the one tower and consists of green blocks in the other tower.You are to write a program that will find the number of different red-green towers of heighthmodulo109+ 7.InputThe only line of input contains two integersrandg, separated by a single space — the number of available red and green blocks respectively (0 ≤r,g≤ 2·105,r+g≥ 1).OutputOutput the only integer — the number of different possible red-green towers of heighthmodulo109+ 7.ExamplesInput4 6Output2Input9 7Output6Input1 1Output2NoteThe image in the problem statement shows all possible red-green towers for the first sample.",
