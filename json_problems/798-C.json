He considers the sequenceB= [b1,b2, ...,bn]beautiful if thegcdof all its elements is bigger than1, i.e..Mike wants to change his sequence in order to make it beautiful. In one move he can choose an indexi(1 ≤i<n), delete numbersai,ai+ 1and put numbersai-ai+ 1,ai+ai+ 1in their place instead, in this order. He wants perform as few operations as possible. Find the minimal number of operations to make sequenceAbeautiful if it's possible, or tell him that it is impossible to do so.is the biggest non-negative numberdsuch thatddividesbifor everyi(1 ≤i≤n).InputThe first line contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 100 000) — length of sequenceA.The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — elements of sequenceA.OutputOutput on the first line \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to make sequenceAbeautiful by performing operations described above, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.If the answer was \"YES\", output the minimal number of moves needed to make sequenceAbeautiful.ExamplesInput21 1OutputYES1Input36 2 4OutputYES0Input21 3OutputYES1NoteIn the first example you can simply make one move to obtain sequence[0, 2]with.In the second example thegcdof the sequence is already greater than1.",
