He wants the garage to consist of a square and a right triangle that are arranged like the following illustration.Define $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ as the lengths of two of the sides in the right triangle as shown in the illustration. An integer $$$x$$$ is suitable if and only if we can construct a garage with assigningpositive integervalues for the lengths $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$a<b$$$) so that the area of the square at the bottom is exactly $$$x$$$. As a good friend of Pak Chanek, you are asked to help him find the $$$N$$$-th smallest suitable number.InputThe only line contains a single integer $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 10^9$$$).OutputAn integer that represents the $$$N$$$-th smallest suitable number.ExampleInput3Output7NoteThe $$$3$$$-rd smallest suitable number is $$$7$$$. A square area of $$$7$$$ can be obtained by assigning $$$a=3$$$ and $$$b=4$$$.",
