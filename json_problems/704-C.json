Black Widowtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNatalia Romanova is trying to test something on the new gun S.H.I.E.L.D gave her. In order to determine the result of the test, she needs to find the number of answers to a certain equation. The equation is of form:Whererepresents logical OR andrepresents logical exclusive OR (XOR), andvi,jare some boolean variables or their negations. Natalia calls the left side of the equation a XNF formula. Each statement in brackets is called a clause, andvi,jare called literals.In the equation Natalia has, the left side is actually a 2-XNF-2 containing variablesx1,x2, ...,xmand their negations. An XNF formula is 2-XNF-2 if:For each1 ≤i≤n,ki≤ 2, i.e. the size of each clause doesn't exceed two.Each variable occursin the formula at most two times(with negation and without negation in total). Please note that it's possible that a variable occurs twice but its negation doesn't occur in any clause (or vice versa).Natalia is given a formula ofmvariables, consisting ofnclauses. Please, make sure to check the samples in order to properly understand how the formula looks like.Natalia is more into fight than theory, so she asked you to tell her the number of answers to this equation. More precisely, you need to find the number of ways to setx1, ...,xmwithtrueandfalse(out of total of2mways) so that the equation is satisfied. Since this number can be extremely large, you need to print the answer modulo109+ 7.Please, note that some variable may appear twice in one clause, or not appear in the equation at all (but still, setting it tofalseortruegives different ways to set variables).InputThe first line of input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 100 000) — the number of clauses and the number of variables respectively.The nextnlines contain the formula. Thei-th of them starts with an integerki— the number of literals in thei-th clause. It is followed bykinon-zero integersai, 1, ...,ai,ki.
