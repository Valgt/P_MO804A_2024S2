Emotestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ emotes in very popular digital collectible card game (the game is pretty famous so we won't say its name). The $$$i$$$-th emote increases the opponent's happiness by $$$a_i$$$ units (we all know that emotes in this game are used to make opponents happy).You have time to use some emotes only $$$m$$$ times. You are allowed to use any emotion once, more than once, or not use it at all. The only restriction is that youcannot use the same emote more than $$$k$$$ times in a row(otherwise the opponent will think that you're trolling him).Note that two emotes $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \\\\ne j$$$) such that $$$a_i = a_j$$$ are considered different.You have to make your opponent as happy as possible. Find the maximum possible opponent's happiness.InputThe first line of the input contains three integers $$$n, m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^9$$$) — the number of emotes, the number of times you can use emotes and the maximum number of times you may use the same emote in a row.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is value of the happiness of the $$$i$$$-th emote.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum opponent's happiness if you use emotes in a way satisfying the problem statement.ExamplesInput6 9 2 1 3 3 7 4 2Output54Input3 1000000000 1 1000000000 987654321 1000000000Output1000000000000000000NoteIn the first example you may use emotes in the following sequence: $$$4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5$$$.",
