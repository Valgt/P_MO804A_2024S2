The king has already sent the message to all knights in the kingdom and they in turn agreed to participate in this grand event.As for you, you're just a simple peasant. There's no surprise that you slept in this morning and were late for the tournament (it was a weekend, after all). Now you are really curious about the results of the tournament. This time the tournament in Berland went as follows:There arenknights participating in the tournament. Each knight was assigned his unique number — an integer from 1 ton.The tournament consisted ofmfights, in thei-th fight the knights that were still in the game with numbers at leastliand at mostrihave fought for the right to continue taking part in the tournament.After thei-th fight among all participants of the fight only one knight won — the knight numberxi, he continued participating in the tournament. Other knights left the tournament.The winner of the last (them-th) fight (the knight numberxm) became the winner of the tournament.You fished out all the information about the fights from your friends. Now for each knight you want to know the name of the knight he was conquered by. We think that the knight numberbwas conquered by the knight numbera, if there was a fight with both of these knights present and the winner was the knight numbera.Write the code that calculates for each knight, the name of the knight that beat him.InputThe first line contains two integersn,m(2 ≤n≤ 3·105; 1 ≤m≤ 3·105)— the number of knights and the number of fights. Each of the followingmlines contains three integersli,ri,xi(1 ≤li<ri≤n;li≤xi≤ri)— the description of thei-th fight.It is guaranteed that the input is correct and matches the problem statement. It is guaranteed that at least two knights took part in each battle.OutputPrintnintegers. If thei-th knight lost, then thei-th number should equal the number of the knight that beat the knight numberi. If thei-th knight is the winner, then thei-th number must equal0.ExamplesInput4 31 2 11 3 31 4 4Output3 1 4 0Input8 43 5 43 7 62 8 81 8 1Output0 8 4 6 4 8 6 1NoteConsider the first test case. Knights 1 and 2 fought the first fight and knight 1 won. Knights 1 and 3 fought the second fight and knight 3 won. The last fight was between knights 3 and 4, knight 4 won.",
