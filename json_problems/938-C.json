Constructing Teststime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's denote am-free matrix as a binary (that is, consisting of only1's and0's) matrix such that every square submatrix of sizem×mof this matrix contains at least one zero.Consider the following problem:You are given two integersnandm. You have to construct anm-free square matrix of sizen×nsuch thatthe number of1's in this matrix is maximum possible. Print the maximum possible number of1's in such matrix.You don't have to solve this problem. Instead, you have to construct a few tests for it.You will be giventnumbersx1,x2, ...,xt. For every, find two integersniandmi(ni≥mi) such that the answer for the aforementioned problem is exactlyxiif we setn=niandm=mi.InputThe first line contains one integert(1 ≤t≤ 100) — the number of tests you have to construct.Thentlines follow,i-th line containing one integerxi(0 ≤xi≤ 109).Note that in hacks you have to sett= 1.OutputFor each test you have to construct, output two positive numbersniandmi(1 ≤mi≤ni≤ 109) such that the maximum number of1's in ami-freeni×nimatrix is exactlyxi. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them; and if this is impossible to construct a test, output a single integer- 1.ExampleInput32101Output5 21 1-1",
