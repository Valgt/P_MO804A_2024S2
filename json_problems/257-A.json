He's gotnsupply-line filters to plug the devices, thei-th supply-line filter hasaisockets.Overall Vasya has gotmdevices andkelectrical sockets in his flat, he can plug the devices or supply-line filters directly. Of course, he can plug the supply-line filter to any other supply-line filter. The device (or the supply-line filter) is considered plugged to electricity if it is either plugged to one ofkelectrical sockets, or if it is plugged to some supply-line filter that is in turn plugged to electricity.What minimum number of supply-line filters from the given set will Vasya need to plug all the devices he has to electricity? Note that all devices and supply-line filters take one socket for plugging and that he can use one socket to plug either one device or one supply-line filter.InputThe first line contains three integersn,m,k(1 ≤n,m,k≤ 50) — the number of supply-line filters, the number of devices and the number of sockets that he can plug to directly, correspondingly. The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 50) — numberaistands for the number of sockets on thei-th supply-line filter.OutputPrint a single number — the minimum number of supply-line filters that is needed to plug all the devices to electricity. If it is impossible to plug all the devices even using all the supply-line filters, print -1.ExamplesInput3 5 33 1 2Output1Input4 7 23 3 2 4Output2Input5 5 11 3 1 2 1Output-1NoteIn the first test case he can plug the first supply-line filter directly to electricity. After he plug it, he get 5 (3 on the supply-line filter and 2 remaining sockets for direct plugging) available sockets to plug. Thus, one filter is enough to plug 5 devices.One of the optimal ways in the second test sample is to plug the second supply-line filter directly and plug the fourth supply-line filter to one of the sockets in the second supply-line filter. Thus, he gets exactly 7 sockets, available to plug: one to plug to the electricity directly, 2 on the second supply-line filter, 4 on the fourth supply-line filter. There's no way he can plug 7 devices if he use one supply-line filter.",
