Maximal Binary Matrixtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given matrix withnrows andncolumns filled with zeroes. You should putkones in it in such a way that the resulting matrix is symmetrical with respect to the main diagonal (the diagonal that goes from the top left to the bottom right corner) and is lexicographically maximal.One matrix is lexicographically greater than the other if the first different number in the first different row from the top in the first matrix is greater than the corresponding number in the second one.If there exists no such matrix then output-1.InputThe first line consists of two numbersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 100,0 ≤k≤ 106).OutputIf the answer exists then output resulting matrix. Otherwise output-1.ExamplesInput2 1Output1 00 0Input3 2Output1 0 00 1 00 0 0Input2 5Output-1",
