They have placednchocolate bars in a line. Alice starts to eat chocolate bars one by one from left to right, and Bob — from right to left.

When the player consumes a chocolate bar, he immediately starts with another. It is not allowed to eat two chocolate bars at the same time, to leave the bar unfinished and to make pauses. If both players start to eat the same bar simultaneously, Bob leaves it to Alice as a true gentleman.How many bars each of the players will consume?InputThe first line contains one integern(1 ≤n≤ 105) — the amount of bars on the table.
