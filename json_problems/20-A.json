It is possible to use any number of characters'/'as a delimiter in path instead of one traditional'/'. For example, strings//usr///local//nginx/sbin//and/usr/local/nginx///sbinare equivalent. The character'/'(or some sequence of such characters) at the end of the path is required only in case of the path to the root directory, which can be represented as single character'/'.A path called normalized if it contains the smallest possible number of characters'/'.Your task is to transform a given path to the normalized form.InputThe first line of the input contains only lowercase Latin letters and character'/'â€” the path to some directory. All paths start with at least one character'/'. The length of the given line is no more than 100 characters, it is not empty.OutputThe path in normalized form.ExamplesInput//usr///local//nginx/sbinOutput/usr/local/nginx/sbin",
