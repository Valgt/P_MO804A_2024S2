They are numbered starting from the queue's tail: the1-st walrus stands at the end of the queue and then-th walrus stands at the beginning of the queue. Thei-th walrus has the age equal toai.Thei-th walrus becomes displeased if there's a younger walrus standing in front of him, that is, if exists suchj(i<j), thatai>aj. Thedispleasureof thei-th walrus is equal to the number of walruses between him and the furthest walrus ahead of him, which is younger than thei-th one. That is, the further that young walrus stands from him, the stronger the displeasure is.The airport manager asked you to count for each ofnwalruses in the queue his displeasure.InputThe first line contains an integern(2 ≤n≤ 105) — the number of walruses in the queue. The second line contains integersai(1 ≤ai≤ 109).Note that some walruses can have the same age but for the displeasure to emerge the walrus that is closer to the head of the queue needs to bestrictly youngerthan the other one.OutputPrintnnumbers: if thei-th walrus is pleased with everything, print \"-1\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print thei-th walrus's displeasure: the number of other walruses that stand between him and the furthest from him younger walrus.ExamplesInput610 8 5 3 50 45Output2 1 0 -1 0 -1Input710 4 6 3 2 8 15Output4 2 1 0 -1 -1 -1Input510 3 1 10 11Output1 0 -1 -1 -1",
