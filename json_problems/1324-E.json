    "statement": "E. Sleeping Scheduletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVova had a pretty weird sleeping schedule. There are $$$h$$$ hours in a day. Vova will sleep exactly $$$n$$$ times. The $$$i$$$-th time he will sleep exactly after $$$a_i$$$ hours from the time he woke up. You can assume that Vova woke up exactly at the beginning of this story (the initial time is $$$0$$$). Each time Vova sleepsexactly one day(in other words, $$$h$$$ hours).Vova thinks that the $$$i$$$-th sleeping time isgoodif he starts to sleep between hours $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ inclusive.Vova can control himself and before the $$$i$$$-th time can choose between two options: go to sleep after $$$a_i$$$ hours or after $$$a_i - 1$$$ hours.Your task is to say the maximum number ofgoodsleeping times Vova can obtain if he acts optimally.InputThe first line of the input contains four integers $$$n, h, l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2000, 3 \\\\le h \\\\le 2000, 0 \\\\le l \\\\le r < h$$$) — the number of times Vova goes to sleep, the number of hours in a day and the segment of thegoodsleeping time.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i < h$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the number of hours after which Vova goes to sleep the $$$i$$$-th time.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum number ofgoodsleeping times Vova can obtain if he acts optimally.ExampleInput7 24 21 23 16 17 14 20 20 11 22Output3NoteThe maximum number ofgoodtimes in the example is $$$3$$$.The story starts from $$$t=0$$$. Then Vova goes to sleep after $$$a_1 - 1$$$ hours, now the time is $$$15$$$. This time is not good. Then Vova goes to sleep after $$$a_2 - 1$$$ hours, now the time is $$$15 + 16 = 7$$$. This time is also not good. Then Vova goes to sleep after $$$a_3$$$ hours, now the time is $$$7 + 14 = 21$$$. This time isgood. Then Vova goes to sleep after $$$a_4 - 1$$$ hours, now the time is $$$21 + 19 = 16$$$. This time is not good. Then Vova goes to sleep after $$$a_5$$$ hours, now the time is $$$16 + 20 = 12$$$. This time is not good. Then Vova goes to sleep after $$$a_6$$$ hours, now the time is $$$12 + 11 = 23$$$. This time isgood. Then Vova goes to sleep after $$$a_7$$$ hours, now the time is $$$23 + 22 = 21$$$. This time is alsogood.",
