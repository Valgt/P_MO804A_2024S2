Useful Edgestime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a weighted undirected graph on $$$n$$$ vertices along with $$$q$$$ triples $$$(u, v, l)$$$, where in each triple $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ are vertices and $$$l$$$ is a positive integer. An edge $$$e$$$ is calledusefulif there is at least one triple $$$(u, v, l)$$$ and a path (not necessarily simple) with the following properties:$$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ are the endpoints of this path,$$$e$$$ is one of the edges of this path,the sum of weights of all edges on this path doesn't exceed $$$l$$$.Please print the number of useful edges in this graph.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2\\\\leq n\\\\leq 600$$$, $$$0\\\\leq m\\\\leq \\\\frac{n(n-1)}2$$$).Each of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq u, v\\\\leq n$$$, $$$u\\\\neq v$$$, $$$1\\\\leq w\\\\leq 10^9$$$), denoting an edge connecting vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ and having a weight $$$w$$$.The following line contains the only integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq q\\\\leq \\\\frac{n(n-1)}2$$$) denoting the number of triples.Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains three integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ and $$$l$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq u, v\\\\leq n$$$, $$$u\\\\neq v$$$, $$$1\\\\leq l\\\\leq 10^9$$$) denoting a triple $$$(u, v, l)$$$.It's guaranteed that:the graph doesn't contain loops or multiple edges;all pairs $$$(u, v)$$$ in the triples are also different.OutputPrint a single integer denoting the number of useful edges in the graph.ExamplesInput4 6 1 2 1 2 3 1 3 4 1 1 3 3 2 4 3 1 4 5 1 1 4 4Output5Input4 2 1 2 10 3 4 10 6 1 2 11 1 3 11 1 4 11 2 3 11 2 4 11 3 4 9Output1Input3 2 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 1 2 5Output2NoteIn the first example each edge is useful, except the one of weight $$$5$$$.In the second example only edge between $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ is useful, because it belongs to the path $$$1-2$$$, and $$$10 \\\\leq 11$$$. The edge between $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$, on the other hand, is not useful.In the third example both edges are useful, for there is a path $$$1-2-3-2$$$ of length exactly $$$5$$$. Please note that the path may pass through a vertex more than once.",
