The vertices are numbered from1ton, the root is the vertex number1.Each vertex has a color, let's denote the color of vertexvbycv. Initiallycv= 0.You have to color the tree into the given colors using the smallest possible number of steps. On each step you can choose a vertexvand a colorx, and then color all vectices in the subtree ofv(includingvitself) in colorx. In other words, for every vertexu, such that the path from root toupasses throughv, setcu=x.It is guaranteed that you have to color each vertex in a color different from0.You can learn what a rooted tree is using the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory).InputThe first line contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 104) — the number of vertices in the tree.The second line containsn- 1integersp2,p3, ...,pn(1 ≤pi<i), wherepimeans that there is an edge between verticesiandpi.The third line containsnintegersc1,c2, ...,cn(1 ≤ci≤n), whereciis the color you should color thei-th vertex into.It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum number of steps you have to perform to color the tree into given colors.ExamplesInput61 2 2 1 52 1 1 1 1 1Output3Input71 1 2 3 1 43 3 1 1 1 2 3Output5NoteThe tree from the first sample is shown on the picture (numbers are vetices' indices):On first step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex1into color2(numbers are colors):On seond step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex5into color1:On third step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex2into color1:The tree from the second sample is shown on the picture (numbers are vetices' indices):On first step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex1into color3(numbers are colors):On second step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex3into color1:On third step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex6into color2:On fourth step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex4into color1:On fith step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex7into color3:",
