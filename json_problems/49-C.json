The volumes are numbered from1ton. He thinks that it does not do to arrange the book simply according to their order. Vasya wants to minimize the number of the disposition’sdivisors— the positive integersisuch that for at least onej(1 ≤j≤n) is true both:jmodi= 0and at the same timep(j)modi= 0, wherep(j)is the number of the tome that stands on thej-th place andmodis the operation of taking the division remainder. Naturally, one volume can occupy exactly one place and in one place can stand exactly one volume.Help Vasya — find the volume disposition with the minimum number of divisors.InputThe first line contains numbern(1 ≤n≤ 100000) which represents the number of volumes and free places.OutputPrintnnumbers — the sought disposition with the minimum divisor number. Thej-th number (1 ≤j≤n) should be equal top(j)— the number of tome that stands on thej-th place. If there are several solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput2Output2 1Input3Output1 3 2",
