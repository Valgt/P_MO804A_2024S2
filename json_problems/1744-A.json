Number Replacementtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAn integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ is being transformed into an array of lowercase English letters using the following prodecure:While there is at least one number in the array:Choose any number $$$x$$$ from the array $$$a$$$, and any letter of the English alphabet $$$y$$$.Replace all occurrences of number $$$x$$$ with the letter $$$y$$$.For example, if we initially had an array $$$a = [2, 3, 2, 4, 1]$$$, then we could transform it the following way:Choose the number $$$2$$$ and the letterc. After that $$$a = [c, 3, c, 4, 1]$$$.Choose the number $$$3$$$ and the lettera. After that $$$a = [c, a, c, 4, 1]$$$.Choose the number $$$4$$$ and the lettert. After that $$$a = [c, a, c, t, 1]$$$.Choose the number $$$1$$$ and the lettera. After that $$$a = [c, a, c, t, a]$$$.After the transformation all letters are united into a string, in our example we get the string \"cacta\".Having the array $$$a$$$ and the string $$$s$$$ determine if the string $$$s$$$ could be got from the array $$$a$$$ after the described transformation?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.Then the description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 50$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers: $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 50$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.The third line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters.OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\", if we can get the string $$$s$$$ from the array $$$a$$$, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output each letter in any case.ExampleInput752 3 2 4 1cacta150a211 22ab41 2 2 1aaab51 2 3 2 1aaaaa61 10 2 9 3 8azzfdb71 2 3 4 1 1 2abababbOutputYES YES YES NO YES YES NONoteThe first test case corresponds to the sample described in the statement.In the second test case we can choose the number $$$50$$$ and the lettera.In the third test case we can choose the number $$$11$$$ and the lettera, after that $$$a = [a, 22]$$$. Then we choose the number $$$22$$$ and the letterband get $$$a = [a, b]$$$.In the fifth test case we can change all numbers one by one to the lettera.",
