From S To Ttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three strings $$$s$$$, $$$t$$$ and $$$p$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may perform any number (possibly, zero) operations on these strings.During each operation you choose any character from $$$p$$$, erase it from $$$p$$$ and insert it into string $$$s$$$ (you may insert this character anywhere you want: in the beginning of $$$s$$$, in the end or between any two consecutive characters).For example, if $$$p$$$ isaba, and $$$s$$$ isde, then the following outcomes are possible (the character we erase from $$$p$$$ and insert into $$$s$$$ is highlighted):aba$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ba,de$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ade;aba$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ba,de$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$dae;aba$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ba,de$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$dea;aba$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$aa,de$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$bde;aba$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$aa,de$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$dbe;aba$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$aa,de$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$deb;aba$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ab,de$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ade;aba$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ab,de$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$dae;aba$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ab,de$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$dea;Your goal is to perform several (maybe zero) operations so that $$$s$$$ becomes equal to $$$t$$$. Please determine whether it is possible.Note that you have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 100$$$) â€” the number of queries. Each query is represented by three consecutive lines.The first line of each query contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 100$$$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.The second line of each query contains the string $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |t| \\\\le 100$$$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.The third line of each query contains the string $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |p| \\\\le 100$$$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.OutputFor each query printYESif it is possible to make $$$s$$$ equal to $$$t$$$, andNOotherwise.You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill all be recognized as positive answer).ExampleInput4 ab acxb cax a aaaa aaabbcc a aaaa aabbcc ab baaa aaaaaOutputYES YES NO NONoteIn the first test case there is the following sequence of operation:$$$s = $$$ab, $$$t = $$$acxb, $$$p = $$$cax;$$$s = $$$acb, $$$t = $$$acxb, $$$p = $$$ax;$$$s = $$$acxb, $$$t = $$$acxb, $$$p = $$$a.In the second test case there is the following sequence of operation:$$$s = $$$a, $$$t = $$$aaaa, $$$p = $$$aaabbcc;$$$s = $$$aa, $$$t = $$$aaaa, $$$p = $$$aabbcc;$$$s = $$$aaa, $$$t = $$$aaaa, $$$p = $$$abbcc;$$$s = $$$aaaa, $$$t = $$$aaaa, $$$p = $$$bbcc.",
