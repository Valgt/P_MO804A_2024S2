The Clocktime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVictor has a24-hour clockthat shows the time in the format \"HH:MM\" (00$$$\\\\le$$$HH$$$\\\\le$$$23,00$$$\\\\le$$$MM$$$\\\\le$$$59). He looks at the clock every $$$x$$$ minutes, and the clock is currently showing time $$$s$$$.How manydifferentpalindromes will Victor see in total after looking at the clock every $$$x$$$ minutes, the first time being at time $$$s$$$?For example, if the clock starts out as03:12and Victor looks at the clock every $$$360$$$ minutes (i.e. every $$$6$$$ hours), then he will see the times03:12,09:12,15:12,21:12,03:12, and the times will continue to repeat. Here the time21:12is the only palindrome he will ever see, so the answer is $$$1$$$.A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, the times12:21,05:50,11:11are palindromes but13:13,22:10,02:22are not.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$5$$$ with the format \"HH:MM\" where \"HH\" is from \"00\" to \"23\" and \"MM\" is from \"00\" to \"59\" (both \"HH\" and \"MM\" have exactly two digits) and an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 1440$$$) — the number of minutes Victor takes to look again at the clock.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of different palindromes Victor will see if he looks at the clock every $$$x$$$ minutes starting from time $$$s$$$.ExampleInput603:12 36000:00 113:22 215:15 1011:11 144022:30 27Output1 16 10 0 1 1NoteThe first test case is explained in the statement.",
