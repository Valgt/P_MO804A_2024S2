He wants to insertnnumbers, in the order they are given, into the hash table. For thei-th numberxi, DZY will put it into the bucket numberedh(xi), whereh(x)is the hash function. In this problem we will assume, thath(x) =xmodp. Operationamodbdenotes taking a remainder after divisionabyb.However, each bucket can contain no more than one element. If DZY wants to insert an number into a bucket which is already filled, we say a \"conflict\" happens. Suppose the first conflict happens right after thei-th insertion, you should outputi. If no conflict happens, just output-1.InputThe first line contains two integers,pandn(2 ≤p,n≤ 300). Thennlines follow. Thei-th of them contains an integerxi(0 ≤xi≤ 109).OutputOutput a single integer — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput10 5021534153Output4Input5 501234Output-1",
