    "statement": "D. Magic Gemstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputReziba has many magic gems. Each magic gem can be split into $$$M$$$ normal gems. The amount of space each magic (and normal) gem takes is $$$1$$$ unit. A normal gem cannot be split.Reziba wants to choose a set of magic gems and split some of them, so the total space occupied by the resulting set of gems is $$$N$$$ units. If a magic gem is chosen and split, it takes $$$M$$$ units of space (since it is split into $$$M$$$ gems); if a magic gem is not split, it takes $$$1$$$ unit.How many different configurations of the resulting set of gems can Reziba have, such that the total amount of space taken is $$$N$$$ units? Print the answer modulo $$$1000000007$$$ ($$$10^9+7$$$). Two configurations are considered different if the number of magic gems Reziba takes to form them differs, or the indices of gems Reziba has to split differ.InputThe input contains a single line consisting of $$$2$$$ integers $$$N$$$ and $$$M$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le N \\\\le 10^{18}$$$, $$$2 \\\\le M \\\\le 100$$$).OutputPrint one integer, the total number of configurations of the resulting set of gems, given that the total amount of space taken is $$$N$$$ units. Print the answer modulo $$$1000000007$$$ ($$$10^9+7$$$).ExamplesInput4 2Output5Input3 2Output3NoteIn the first example each magic gem can split into $$$2$$$ normal gems, and we know that the total amount of gems are $$$4$$$.Let $$$1$$$ denote a magic gem, and $$$0$$$ denote a normal gem.The total configurations you can have is:$$$1 1 1 1$$$ (None of the gems split);$$$0 0 1 1$$$ (First magic gem splits into $$$2$$$ normal gems);$$$1 0 0 1$$$ (Second magic gem splits into $$$2$$$ normal gems);$$$1 1 0 0$$$ (Third magic gem splits into $$$2$$$ normal gems);$$$0 0 0 0$$$ (First and second magic gems split into total $$$4$$$ normal gems).Hence, answer is $$$5$$$.",
