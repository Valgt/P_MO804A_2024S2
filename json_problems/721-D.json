Maxim and Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecently Maxim has found an array ofnintegers, needed by no one. He immediately come up with idea of changing it: he invented positive integerxand decided to add or subtract it from arbitrary array elements. Formally, by applying single operation Maxim chooses integeri(1 ≤i≤n) and replaces thei-th element of arrayaieither withai+xor withai-x. Please note that the operation may be applied more than once to the same position.Maxim is a curious minimalis, thus he wants to know what is the minimum value that the product of all array elements (i.e.) can reach, if Maxim would apply no more thankoperations to it. Please help him in that.InputThe first line of the input contains three integersn,kandx(1 ≤n,k≤ 200 000, 1 ≤x≤ 109) — the number of elements in the array, the maximum number of operations and the number invented by Maxim, respectively.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an() — the elements of the array found by Maxim.OutputPrintnintegersb1,b2, ...,bnin the only line — the array elements after applying no more thankoperations to the array. In particular,should stay true for every1 ≤i≤n, but the product of all array elements should beminimum possible.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput5 3 15 4 3 5 2Output5 4 3 5 -1Input5 3 15 4 3 5 5Output5 4 0 5 5Input5 3 15 4 4 5 5Output5 1 4 5 5Input3 2 75 4 2Output5 11 -5",
