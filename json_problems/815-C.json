Karen and Supermarkettime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOn the way home, Karen decided to stop by the supermarket to buy some groceries.She needs to buy a lot of goods, but since she is a student her budget is still quite limited. In fact, she can only spend up tobdollars.The supermarket sellsngoods. Thei-th good can be bought forcidollars. Of course, each good can only be bought once.Lately, the supermarket has been trying to increase its business. Karen, being a loyal customer, was givenncoupons. If Karen purchases thei-th good, she can use thei-th coupon to decrease its price bydi. Of course, a coupon cannot be used without buying the corresponding good.There is, however, a constraint with the coupons. For alli≥ 2, in order to use thei-th coupon, Karen must also use thexi-th coupon (which may mean using even more coupons to satisfy the requirement for that coupon).Karen wants to know the following. What is the maximum number of goods she can buy, without exceeding her budgetb?InputThe first line of input contains two integersnandb(1 ≤n≤ 5000,1 ≤b≤ 109), the number of goods in the store and the amount of money Karen has, respectively.The nextnlines describe the items. Specifically:Thei-th line among these starts with two integers,cianddi(1 ≤di<ci≤ 109), the price of thei-th good and the discount when using the coupon for thei-th good, respectively.Ifi≥ 2, this is followed by another integer,xi(1 ≤xi<i), denoting that thexi-th coupon must also be used before this coupon can be used.OutputOutput a single integer on a line by itself, the number of different goods Karen can buy, without exceeding her budget.ExamplesInput6 1610 910 5 112 2 120 18 310 2 32 1 5Output4Input5 103 13 1 13 1 23 1 33 1 4Output5NoteIn the first test case, Karen can purchase the following4items:Use the first coupon to buy the first item for10 - 9 = 1dollar.Use the third coupon to buy the third item for12 - 2 = 10dollars.Use the fourth coupon to buy the fourth item for20 - 18 = 2dollars.Buy the sixth item for2dollars.The total cost of these goods is15, which falls within her budget. Note, for example, that she cannot use the coupon on the sixth item, because then she should have also used the fifth coupon to buy the fifth item, which she did not do here.In the second test case, Karen has enough money to use all the coupons and purchase everything.",
