Caramel Cloudstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt is well-known that the best decoration for a flower bed in Sweetland are vanilla muffins. Seedlings of this plant need sun to grow up. Slastyona hasmseedlings, and thej-th seedling needs at leastkjminutes of sunlight to grow up.Most of the time it's sunny in Sweetland, but sometimes some caramel clouds come, thei-th of which will appear at time moment (minute)liand disappear at time momentri. Of course, the clouds make shadows, and the seedlings can't grow when there is at least one cloud veiling the sun.Slastyona wants to grow up her muffins as fast as possible. She has exactlyCcandies, which is the main currency in Sweetland.One can dispel any cloud by payingcicandies. However, in order to comply with Sweetland's Department of Meteorology regulations,one can't dispel more than two clouds.Slastyona hasn't decided yet which of themseedlings will be planted at the princess' garden, so she needs your help. For each seedling determine the earliest moment it can grow up if Slastyona won't break the law and won't spend more candies than she has. Note that each of the seedlings is considered independently.The seedlings start to grow at time moment0.InputThe first line contains two integersnandC(0 ≤n≤ 3·105, 0 ≤C≤ 109)– the number of caramel clouds and the number of candies Slastyona has.The nextnlines contain three integers each:li,ri,ci(0 ≤li<ri≤ 109, 0 ≤ci≤ 109), describing one caramel cloud.The next line contains single integerm(1 ≤m≤ 3·105)– the number of seedlings. Each of the seedlings is described with one integerkj(1 ≤kj≤ 109)– the required number of sunny minutes.OutputFor each seedling print one integer – the minimum minute Slastyona can grow it up.ExamplesInput3 51 7 11 6 21 7 13725Output12710Input3 151 4 172 8 64 8 9251Output81Input2 103 7 910 90 10210100Output10104NoteConsider the first example. For eachkit is optimal to dispel clouds1and3. Then the remaining cloud will give shadow on time segment[1..6]. So, intervals[0..1]and[6..inf)are sunny.In the second example fork= 1it is not necessary to dispel anything, and fork= 5the best strategy is to dispel clouds2and3. This adds an additional sunny segment[4..8], which together with[0..1]allows to grow up the muffin at the eight minute.If the third example the two seedlings are completely different. For the first one it is necessary to dispel cloud1and obtain a sunny segment[0..10]. However, the same strategy gives answer180for the second seedling. Instead, we can dispel cloud2, to make segments[0..3]and[7..inf)sunny, and this allows up to shorten the time to104.",
