Minimum Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. All elements of both arrays are from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$.You can reorder elements of the array $$$b$$$ (if you want, you may leave the order of elements as it is). After that, let array $$$c$$$ be the array of length $$$n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th element of this array is $$$c_i = (a_i + b_i) \\\\% n$$$, where $$$x \\\\% y$$$ is $$$x$$$ modulo $$$y$$$.Your task is to reorder elements of the array $$$b$$$ to obtain thelexicographicallyminimum possible array $$$c$$$.Array $$$x$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is lexicographically less than array $$$y$$$ of length $$$n$$$, if there exists such $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$), that $$$x_i < y_i$$$, and for any $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le j < i$$$) $$$x_j = y_j$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the number of elements in $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i < n$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.The third line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le b_i < n$$$), where $$$b_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$b$$$.OutputPrint thelexicographicallyminimum possible array $$$c$$$. Recall that your task is to reorder elements of the array $$$b$$$ and obtain thelexicographicallyminimum possible array $$$c$$$, where the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$c$$$ is $$$c_i = (a_i + b_i) \\\\% n$$$.ExamplesInput4 0 1 2 1 3 2 1 1Output1 0 0 2Input7 2 5 1 5 3 4 3 2 4 3 5 6 5 1Output0 0 0 1 0 2 4",
