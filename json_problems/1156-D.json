A number is written on each edge, each number is either $$$0$$$ (let's call such edges $$$0$$$-edges) or $$$1$$$ (those are $$$1$$$-edges).Let's call an ordered pair of vertices $$$(x, y)$$$ ($$$x \\\\ne y$$$)validif, while traversing the simple path from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$, we never go through a $$$0$$$-edge after going through a $$$1$$$-edge. Your task is to calculate the number ofvalidpairs in the tree.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 200000$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.Then $$$n - 1$$$ lines follow, each denoting an edge of the tree. Each edge is represented by three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ and $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$0 \\\\le c_i \\\\le 1$$$, $$$x_i \\\\ne y_i$$$) — the vertices connected by this edge and the number written on it, respectively.It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.OutputPrint one integer — the number ofvalidpairs of vertices.ExampleInput7 2 1 1 3 2 0 4 2 1 5 2 0 6 7 1 7 2 1Output34NoteThe picture corresponding to the first example:",
