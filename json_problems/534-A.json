The teacher suspects that students with adjacent numbers (iandi+ 1) always studied side by side and became friends and if they take an exam sitting next to each other, they will help each other for sure.Your task is to choose the maximum number of students and make such an arrangement of students in the room that no two students with adjacent numbers sit side by side.InputA single line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 5000) — the number of students at an exam.OutputIn the first line print integerk— the maximum number of students who can be seated so that no two students with adjacent numbers sit next to each other.In the second line printkdistinct integersa1,a2, ...,ak(1 ≤ai≤n), whereaiis the number of the student on thei-th position.
