Cut the pietime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputArkady reached then-th level in Township game, so Masha decided to bake a pie for him! Of course, the pie has a shape of convexn-gon, i.e. a polygon withnvertices.Arkady decided to cut the pie in two equal in area parts by cutting it by a straight line, so that he can eat one of them and give the other to Masha. There is a difficulty because Arkady has already put a knife at some point of the pie, so he now has to cut the pie by a straight line passing trough this point.Help Arkady: find a line that passes through the point Arkady has put a knife into and cuts the pie into two parts of equal area, or determine that it's impossible. Your program has to quickly answer many queries with the same pie, but different points in which Arkady puts a knife.InputThe first line contains two integersnandq(3 ≤n≤ 104,1 ≤q≤ 105) — the number of vertices in the pie and the number of queries.nline follow describing the polygon vertices in clockwise order. Thei-th of these line contains two integersxiandyi(- 106≤xi,yi≤ 106) — the coordinates of thei-th vertex. It is guaranteed that the polygon is strictly convex, in particular, no three vertices line on the same line.An empty line follows.qlines follow describing the query points. Thei-th of these lines contain two integersxiandyi(- 106≤xi,yi≤ 106) — the coordinates of the point in which Arkady puts the knife in thei-th query. In is guaranteed that in each query the given point is strictly inside the polygon, in particular, is not on its edges.OutputFor each query print single integer — the polar angle of the line that is the answer for the corresponding query, in radians. The angle should be in the segment[0;π], the angles are measured from the direction ofOXaxis in counter-clockwise order. For example, the polar angle of theOYaxis is. If there is no answer in that query, print-1.If there are several answers, print any of them. Your answer is considered correct if the difference between the areas of the parts divided by the total area of the polygon doesn't exceed10- 4by absolute value. In other words, ifaandbare the areas of the parts after the cut, then your answer is correct if and only of.ExamplesInput3 10 00 33 01 1Output2.67794504460098710000Input5 36 56 35 00 00 55 43 35 2Output0.602287346126900490001.279339532264735800002.85805511179015910000",
