The store doesn’t give change, so he must give the store exactlycdollars, no more and no less. He hasncoins. To makecdollars from his coins, he follows the following algorithm: letSbe the set of coins being used.Sis initially empty. Alfred repeatedly adds toSthe highest-valued coin he has such that the total value of the coins inSafter adding the coin doesn’t exceedc. If there is no such coin, and the value of the coins inSis still less thanc, he gives up and goes home. Note that Alfred never removes a coin fromSafter adding it.As a programmer, you might be aware that Alfred’s algorithm can fail even when there is a set of coins with value exactlyc. For example, if Alfred has one coin worth $3, one coin worth $4, and two coins worth $5, and the moose costs $12, then Alfred will add both of the $5 coins toSand then give up, since adding any other coin would cause the value of the coins inSto exceed $12. Of course, Alfred could instead combine one $3 coin, one $4 coin, and one $5 coin to reach the total.Bob tried to convince Alfred that his algorithm was flawed, but Alfred didn’t believe him. Now Bob wants to give Alfred some coins (in addition to those that Alfred already has) such that Alfred’s algorithm fails. Bob can give Alfred any number of coins of any denomination (subject to the constraint that each coin must be worth a positive integer number of dollars). There can be multiple coins of a single denomination. He would like to minimize the total value of the coins he gives Alfred. Please find this minimum value. If there is no solution, print \"Greed is good\". You can assume that the answer, if it exists, is positive. In other words, Alfred's algorithm will work if Bob doesn't give him any coins.InputThe first line containsc(1 ≤c≤ 200 000) — the price Alfred wants to pay. The second line containsn(1 ≤n≤ 200 000) — the number of coins Alfred initially has. Thennlines follow, each containing a single integerx(1 ≤x≤c) representing the value of one of Alfred's coins.OutputIf there is a solution, print the minimum possible total value of the coins in a solution. Otherwise, print \"Greed is good\" (without quotes).ExamplesInput123534Output5Input508124816373737OutputGreed is goodNoteIn the first sample, Bob should give Alfred a single coin worth $5. This creates the situation described in the problem statement.In the second sample, there is no set of coins that will cause Alfred's algorithm to fail.",
