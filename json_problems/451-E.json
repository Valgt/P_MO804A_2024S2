He has purchasednboxes, where thei-th box containsfiflowers. All flowers in a single box are of the same color (hence they are indistinguishable). Also, no two boxes have flowers of the same color.Now Devu wants to selectexactlysflowers from the boxes to decorate his garden. Devu would like to know, in how many different ways can he select the flowers from each box? Since this number may be very large, he asks you to find the number modulo(109+ 7).Devu considers two ways different if there is at least one box from which different number of flowers are selected in these two ways.InputThe first line of input contains two space-separated integersnands(1 ≤n≤ 20,0 ≤s≤ 1014).The second line containsnspace-separated integersf1,f2, ...fn(0 ≤fi≤ 1012).OutputOutput a single integer — the number of ways in which Devu can select the flowers modulo(109+ 7).ExamplesInput2 31 3Output2Input2 42 2Output1Input3 51 3 2Output3NoteSample 1.
