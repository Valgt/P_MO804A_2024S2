    "statement": "B. And It's Non-Zerotime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array consisting of all integers from $$$[l, r]$$$ inclusive. For example, if $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 5$$$, the array would be $$$[2, 3, 4, 5]$$$. What's the minimum number of elements you can delete to make thebitwise ANDof the array non-zero?Abitwise ANDis a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary representations and performs theANDoperation on each pair of the corresponding bits.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ cases follow.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the description of the array.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the answer to the problem.ExampleInput5 1 2 2 8 4 5 1 5 100000 200000Output1 3 0 2 31072NoteIn the first test case, the array is $$$[1, 2]$$$. Currently, thebitwise ANDis $$$0$$$, as $$$1\\\\ \\\\& \\\\ 2 = 0$$$. However, after deleting $$$1$$$ (or $$$2$$$), the array becomes $$$[2]$$$ (or $$$[1]$$$), and thebitwise ANDbecomes $$$2$$$ (or $$$1$$$). This can be proven to be the optimal, so the answer is $$$1$$$.In the second test case, the array is $$$[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]$$$. Currently, thebitwise ANDis $$$0$$$. However, after deleting $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, and $$$8$$$, the array becomes $$$[2, 3, 6, 7]$$$, and thebitwise ANDbecomes $$$2$$$. This can be proven to be the optimal, so the answer is $$$3$$$. Note that there may be other ways to delete $$$3$$$ elements.",
