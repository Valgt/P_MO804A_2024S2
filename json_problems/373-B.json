Making Sequences is Funtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutWe'll defineS(n)for positive integernas follows: the number of then's digits in the decimal base. For example,S(893) = 3,S(114514) = 6.You want to make a consecutive integer sequence starting from numberm(m,m+ 1, ...). But you need to payS(n)·kto add the numbernto the sequence.You can spend a cost up tow, and you want to make the sequence as long as possible. Write a program that tells sequence's maximum length.InputThe first line contains three integersw(1 ≤w≤ 1016),m(1 ≤m≤ 1016),k(1 ≤k≤ 109).Please, do not write the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.
