Let's assume that in one second, we can choose some disjoint pairs(u1,v1), (u2,v2), ..., (uk,vk)and swap allauiandavifor everyiat the same time (1 ≤ui<vi≤n). The pairs are disjoint if everyuiandvjare different from each other.We want to sort the sequence completely in increasing order as fast as possible. Given the initial permutation, calculate the number of ways to achieve this. Two ways are different if and only if there is a timet, such that the set of pairs used for swapping at that time are different as sets (so ordering of pairs doesn't matter). If the given permutation is already sorted, it takes no time to sort, so the number of ways to sort it is1.To make the problem more interesting, we havekholes inside the permutation. So exactlyknumbers ofa1,a2, ...,anare not yet determined. For every possibility of filling the holes, calculate the number of ways, and print the total sum of these values modulo1000000007(109+ 7).InputThe first line contains two integersn(1 ≤n≤ 105)andk(0 ≤k≤ 12). The second line contains the permutation sequencea1, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤n). If a number is not yet determined, it is denoted as0. There are exactlykzeroes. All the numbersaithat aren't equal to zero are distinct.OutputPrint the total sum of the number of ways modulo1000000007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput5 01 5 2 4 3Output6Input5 21 0 2 4 0Output7",
