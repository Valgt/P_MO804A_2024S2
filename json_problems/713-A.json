Sonya and Queriestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputToday Sonya learned about long integers and invited all her friends to share the fun. Sonya has an initially empty multiset with integers. Friends give hertqueries, each of one of the following type:+ai— add non-negative integeraito the multiset. Note, that she has a multiset, thus there may be many occurrences of the same integer.-ai— delete a single occurrence of non-negative integeraifrom the multiset. It's guaranteed, that there is at least oneaiin the multiset.?s— count the number of integers in the multiset (with repetitions) that match some patternsconsisting of0and1. In the pattern,0stands for the even digits, while1stands for the odd. Integerxmatches the patterns, if the parity of thei-th from the right digit in decimal notation matches thei-th from the right digit of the pattern. If the pattern is shorter than this integer, it's supplemented with0-s from the left. Similarly, if the integer is shorter than the pattern its decimal notation is supplemented with the0-s from the left.For example, if the pattern iss= 010, than integers92,2212,50and414match the pattern, while integers3,110,25and1030do not.InputThe first line of the input contains an integert(1 ≤t≤ 100 000) — the number of operation Sonya has to perform.Nexttlines provide the descriptions of the queries in order they appear in the input file. Thei-th row starts with a characterci— the type of the corresponding operation. Ifciis equal to '+' or '-' then it's followed by a space and an integerai(0 ≤ai< 1018) given without leading zeroes (unless it's0). Ifciequals '?' then it's followed by a space and a sequence of zeroes and onse, giving the pattern of length no more than18.It's guaranteed that there will be at least one query of type '?'.It's guaranteed that any time some integer is removed from the multiset, there will be at least one occurrence of this integer in it.OutputFor each query of the third type print the number of integers matching the given pattern. Each integer is counted as many times, as it appears in the multiset at this moment of time.ExamplesInput12+ 1+ 241? 1+ 361- 241? 0101+ 101? 101- 101? 101+ 4000? 0Output21211Input4+ 200+ 200- 200? 0Output1NoteConsider the integers matching the patterns from the queries of the third type. Queries are numbered in the order they appear in the input.1and241.361.101and361.361.4000.",
