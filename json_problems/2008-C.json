An array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is considered good if and only if:the array $$$a$$$ is increasing, meaning $$$a_{i - 1} < a_i$$$ for all $$$2 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$;the differences between adjacent elements are increasing, meaning $$$a_i - a_{i-1} < a_{i+1} - a_i$$$ for all $$$2 \\\\le i < n$$$.Sakurako has come up with boundaries $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ and wants to construct a good array of maximum length, where $$$l \\\\le a_i \\\\le r$$$ for all $$$a_i$$$.Help Sakurako find the maximum length of a good array for the given $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1\\\\le l\\\\le r\\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a single integer  — the length of the longest good array Sakurako can form given $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$.ExampleInput51 21 52 210 201 1000000000Output2 3 1 5 44721NoteFor $$$l=1$$$ and $$$r=5$$$, one possible array could be $$$(1,2,5)$$$. It can be proven that an array of length $$$4$$$ does not exist for the given $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$.For $$$l=2$$$ and $$$r=2$$$, the only possible array is $$$(2)$$$.For $$$l=10$$$ and $$$r=20$$$, the only possible array is $$$(10,11,13,16,20)$$$.",
