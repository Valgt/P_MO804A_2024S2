Count The Blockstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou wrote down all integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$10^n - 1$$$, padding them with leading zeroes so their lengths are exactly $$$n$$$. For example, if $$$n = 3$$$ then you wrote out000,001, ...,998,999.A block in an integer $$$x$$$ is a consecutive segment of equal digits that cannot be extended to the left or to the right.For example, in the integer $$$00027734000$$$ there are three blocks of length $$$1$$$, one block of length $$$2$$$ and two blocks of length $$$3$$$.For all integers $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ count the number of blocks of length $$$i$$$ among the written down integers.Since these integers may be too large, print them modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe only line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputIn the only line print $$$n$$$ integers.
