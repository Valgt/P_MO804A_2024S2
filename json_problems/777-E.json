Hanoi Factorytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOf course you have heard the famous task about Hanoi Towers, but did you know that there is a special factory producing the rings for this wonderful game? Once upon a time, the ruler of the ancient Egypt ordered the workers of Hanoi Factory to create as high tower as possible. They were not ready to serve such a strange order so they had to create this new tower using already produced rings.There arenrings in factory's stock. Thei-th ring has inner radiusai, outer radiusbiand heighthi. The goal is to select some subset of rings and arrange them such that the following conditions are satisfied:Outer radiuses form a non-increasing sequence, i.e. one can put thej-th ring on thei-th ring only ifbj≤bi.Rings should not fall one into the the other. That means one can place ringjon the ringionly ifbj>ai.The total height of all rings used should be maximum possible.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 100 000) — the number of rings in factory's stock.Thei-th of the nextnlines contains three integersai,biandhi(1 ≤ai,bi,hi≤ 109,bi>ai) — inner radius, outer radius and the height of thei-th ring respectively.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum height of the tower that can be obtained.ExamplesInput31 5 12 6 23 7 3Output6Input41 2 11 3 34 6 25 7 1Output4NoteIn the first sample, the optimal solution is to take all the rings and put them on each other in order3,2,1.In the second sample, one can put the ring3on the ring4and get the tower of height3, or put the ring1on the ring2and get the tower of height4.",
