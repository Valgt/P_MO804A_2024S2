    "statement": "B. Anton and Digitstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecently Anton found a box with digits in his room. There arek2digits2,k3digits3,k5digits5andk6digits6.Anton's favorite integers are32and256. He decided to compose this integers from digits he has. He wants to make the sum of these integers as large as possible. Help him solve this task!Each digit can be used no more than once, i.e. the composed integers should contain no more thank2digits2,k3digits3and so on. Of course, unused digits are not counted in the sum.InputThe only line of the input contains four integersk2,k3,k5andk6— the number of digits2,3,5and6respectively (0 ≤k2,k3,k5,k6≤ 5·106).OutputPrint one integer — maximum possible sum of Anton's favorite integers that can be composed using digits from the box.ExamplesInput5 1 3 4Output800Input1 1 1 1Output256NoteIn the first sample, there are five digits2, one digit3, three digits5and four digits6. Anton can compose three integers256and one integer32to achieve the value256 + 256 + 256 + 32 = 800. Note, that there is one unused integer2and one unused integer6. They are not counted in the answer.In the second sample, the optimal answer is to create on integer256, thus the answer is256.",
