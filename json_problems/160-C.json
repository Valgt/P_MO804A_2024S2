Let's consider an arbitrary sequence containingn(not necessarily different) integersa1,a2, ...,an. We are interested in all possible pairs of numbers (ai,aj), (1 ≤i,j≤n). In other words, let's consider alln2pairs of numbers, picked from the given array.For example, in sequencea= {3, 1, 5}are9pairs of numbers:(3, 3), (3, 1), (3, 5), (1, 3), (1, 1), (1, 5), (5, 3), (5, 1), (5, 5).Let's sort all resulting pairs lexicographically by non-decreasing. Let us remind you that pair (p1,q1) islexicographically lessthan pair (p2,q2) only if eitherp1<p2, orp1=p2andq1<q2.Then the sequence, mentioned above, will be sorted like that:(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5)Let's number all the pair in the sorted list from1ton2. Your task is formulated like this: you should find thek-th pair in the ordered list of all possible pairs of the array you've been given.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 105, 1 ≤k≤n2). The second line contains the array containingnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(- 109≤ai≤ 109). The numbers in the array can coincide. All numbers are separated with spaces.Please do not use the%lldspecificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to usecin,cout, streams or the%I64dspecificator instead.OutputIn the single line print two numbers — the soughtk-th pair.ExamplesInput2 42 1Output2 2Input3 23 1 5Output1 3NoteIn the first sample the sorted sequence for the given array looks as:(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2). The4-th of them is pair(2, 2).The sorted sequence for the array from the second sample is given in the statement. The2-nd pair there is(1, 3).",
