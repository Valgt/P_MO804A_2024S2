Each vertex has a number written on it; numberaiis written on vertexi.Let's denoted(i,j)as the distance between verticesiandjin the tree (that is, the number of edges in the shortest path fromitoj). Also let's denote thek-blocked subtreeof vertexxas the set of verticesysuch that both these conditions are met:xis an ancestor ofy(every vertex is an ancestor of itself);d(x,y) ≤k.You are givenmqueries to the tree.i-th query is represented by two numbersxiandki, and the answer to this query is the minimum value ofajamong such verticesjsuch thatjbelongs toki-blocked subtree ofxi.Write a program that would process these queries quickly!Note that the queries are given in a modified way.InputThe first line contains two integersnandr(1 ≤r≤n≤ 100000) — the number of vertices in the tree and the index of the root, respectively.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — the numbers written on the vertices.Thenn- 1lines follow, each containing two integersxandy(1 ≤x,y≤n) and representing an edge between verticesxandy. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.Next line contains one integerm(1 ≤m≤ 106) — the number of queries to process.Thenmlines follow,i-th line containing two numberspiandqi, which can be used to restorei-th query (1 ≤pi,qi≤n).i-th query can be restored as follows:Letlastbe the answer for previous query (or0ifi= 1).
