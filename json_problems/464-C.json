Initially, Andrew has strings, consisting of digits. Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di→ti\", that means \"replace all digitsdiin stringswith substrings equal toti\". For example, ifs= 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transformssto10031003, and query \"3 →\" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it tos= 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal tosby1000000007 (109+ 7). When you representsas a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also ifsis an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!InputThe first line contains strings(1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integern(0 ≤n≤ 105) — the number of queries.The nextnlines contain the descriptions of the queries. Thei-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", wherediis exactly one digit (from 0 to 9),tiis a string consisting of digits (tican be an empty string). The sum of lengths oftifor all queries doesn't exceed105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.OutputPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by1000000007 (109+ 7).ExamplesInput12312312->00Output10031003Input12312313->Output1212Input22222->00->7Output777Input10000000080Output1NoteNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from stringsafter the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).",
