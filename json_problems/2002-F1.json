    "statement": "F1. Court Blue (Easy Version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. In this version, $$$n=m$$$ and the time limit is lower. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.In the court of the Blue King, Lelle and Flamm are having a performance match. The match consists of several rounds. In each round, either Lelle or Flamm wins.Let $$$W_L$$$ and $$$W_F$$$ denote the number of wins of Lelle and Flamm, respectively. The Blue King considers a match to besuccessfulif and only if:after every round, $$$\\\\gcd(W_L,W_F)\\\\le 1$$$;at the end of the match, $$$W_L\\\\le n, W_F\\\\le m$$$.Note that $$$\\\\gcd(0,x)=\\\\gcd(x,0)=x$$$ for every non-negative integer $$$x$$$.Lelle and Flamm can decide to stop the match whenever they want, and the final score of the performance is $$$l \\\\cdot W_L + f \\\\cdot W_F$$$.Please help Lelle and Flamm coordinate their wins and losses such that the performance issuccessful, and the total score of the performance is maximized.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$l$$$, $$$f$$$ ($$$2\\\\leq n\\\\leq m \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot 10^7$$$, $$$1\\\\leq l,f \\\\leq 10^9$$$, $$$\\\\bf{n=m}$$$): $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ gives the upper bound on the number of Lelle and Flamm's wins, $$$l$$$ and $$$f$$$ determine the final score of the performance.Unusual additional constraint: it is guaranteed that, for each test, there are no pairs of test cases with the same pair of $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total score of asuccessfulperformance.ExamplesInput83 3 2 54 4 1 46 6 2 27 7 2 39 9 9 12 2 1 45 5 1 48 8 6 7Output19 17 18 33 86 9 24 86Input120000000 20000000 1341 331Output33439999007Input21984 1984 19 849982 9982 44 35Output204143 788403NoteIn the first test case, a possible performance is as follows:Flamm wins, $$$\\\\gcd(0,1)=1$$$.Lelle wins, $$$\\\\gcd(1,1)=1$$$.Flamm wins, $$$\\\\gcd(1,2)=1$$$.Flamm wins, $$$\\\\gcd(1,3)=1$$$.Lelle wins, $$$\\\\gcd(2,3)=1$$$.Lelle and Flamm agree to stop the match.The final score is $$$2\\\\cdot2+3\\\\cdot5=19$$$.In the third test case, a possible performance is as follows:Flamm wins, $$$\\\\gcd(0,1)=1$$$.Lelle wins, $$$\\\\gcd(1,1)=1$$$.Lelle wins, $$$\\\\gcd(2,1)=1$$$.Lelle wins, $$$\\\\gcd(3,1)=1$$$.Lelle wins, $$$\\\\gcd(4,1)=1$$$.Lelle wins, $$$\\\\gcd(5,1)=1$$$.Flamm wins, $$$\\\\gcd(5,2)=1$$$.Flamm wins, $$$\\\\gcd(5,3)=1$$$.Flamm wins, $$$\\\\gcd(5,4)=1$$$.Lelle and Flamm agree to stop the match.The final score is $$$5\\\\cdot2+4\\\\cdot2=18$$$. Note that Lelle and Flamm can stop the match even if neither of them has $$$n$$$ wins.",
