ZS Shuffles Cardstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputzscoderhas a deck of $$$n+m$$$ custom-made cards, which consists of $$$n$$$ cards labelled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ jokers. Sincezscoderis lonely, he wants to play a game with himself using those cards.Initially, the deck is shuffled uniformly randomly and placed on the table.zscoderhas a set $$$S$$$ which is initially empty.Every second,zscoderdraws the top card from the deck.If the card has a number $$$x$$$ written on it,zscoderremoves the card and adds $$$x$$$ to the set $$$S$$$.If the card drawn is a joker,zscoderplaces all the cards back into the deck and reshuffles (uniformly randomly) the $$$n+m$$$ cards to form a new deck (hence the new deck now contains all cards from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and the $$$m$$$ jokers). Then, if $$$S$$$ currently contains all the elements from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the game ends. Shuffling the deck doesn't take time at all.What is the expected number of seconds before the game ends? We can show that the answer can be written in the form $$$\\\\frac{P}{Q}$$$ where $$$P, Q$$$ are relatively prime integers and $$$Q \\\\neq 0 \\\\bmod 998244353$$$. Output the value of $$$(P \\\\cdot Q^{-1})$$$ modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^{6}$$$).OutputOutput a single integer, the value of $$$(P \\\\cdot Q^{-1})$$$ modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExamplesInput2 1Output5Input3 2Output332748127Input14 9Output969862773NoteFor the first sample, it can be proven that the expected time before the game ends is $$$5$$$ seconds.For the second sample, it can be proven that the expected time before the game ends is $$$\\\\frac{28}{3}$$$ seconds.",
