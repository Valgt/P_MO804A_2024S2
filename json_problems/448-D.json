Bizon the Champion painted ann×mmultiplication table, where the element on the intersection of thei-th row andj-th column equalsi·j(the rows and columns of the table are numbered starting from 1). Then he was asked: what number in the table is thek-th largest number? Bizon the Champion always answered correctly and immediately. Can you repeat his success?Consider the given multiplication table. If you write out alln·mnumbers from the table in the non-decreasing order, then thek-th number you write out is called thek-th largest number.InputThe single line contains integersn,mandk(1 ≤n,m≤ 5·105; 1 ≤k≤n·m).OutputPrint thek-th largest number in an×mmultiplication table.ExamplesInput2 2 2Output2Input2 3 4Output3Input1 10 5Output5NoteA2 × 3multiplication table looks like this:1 2 32 4 6",
