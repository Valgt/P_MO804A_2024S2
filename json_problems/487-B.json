Let's call themaifrom left to right.Now Alexandra wants to split it into some pieces (possibly1). For each piece of strip, it must satisfy:Each piece should contain at leastlnumbers.The difference between the maximal and the minimal number on the piece should be at mosts.Please help Alexandra to find the minimal number of pieces meeting the condition above.InputThe first line contains three space-separated integersn,s,l(1 ≤n≤ 105, 0 ≤s≤ 109, 1 ≤l≤ 105).The second line containsnintegersaiseparated by spaces (- 109≤ai≤ 109).OutputOutput the minimal number of strip pieces.If there are no ways to split the strip, output -1.ExamplesInput7 2 21 3 1 2 4 1 2Output3Input7 2 21 100 1 100 1 100 1Output-1NoteFor the first sample, we can split the strip into3pieces:[1, 3, 1], [2, 4], [1, 2].For the second sample, we can't let1and100be on the same piece, so no solution exists.",
