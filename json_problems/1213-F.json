Unstable String Sorttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAuthors have come up with the string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters.You are given two permutations of its indices (not necessary equal) $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ (both of length $$$n$$$). Recall that the permutation is the array of length $$$n$$$ which contains each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once.For all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ the following properties hold: $$$s[p_i] \\\\le s[p_{i + 1}]$$$ and $$$s[q_i] \\\\le s[q_{i + 1}]$$$. It means that if you will write down all characters of $$$s$$$ in order of permutation indices, the resulting string will be sorted in the non-decreasing order.Your task is to restoreanysuch string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting ofat least $$$k$$$ distinct lowercase Latin letterswhich suits the given permutations.If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5, 1 \\\\le k \\\\le 26$$$) — the length of the string and the number of distinct characters required.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$, all $$$p_i$$$ are distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$) — the permutation $$$p$$$.The third line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$q_1, q_2, \\\\dots, q_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q_i \\\\le n$$$, all $$$q_i$$$ are distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$) — the permutation $$$q$$$.OutputIf it is impossible to find the suitable string, print \"NO\" on the first line.Otherwise print \"YES\" on the first line and string $$$s$$$ on the second line. It should consist of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters, contain at least $$$k$$$ distinct characters and suit the given permutations.If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.ExampleInput3 2 1 2 3 1 3 2OutputYES abb",
