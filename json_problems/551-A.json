    "statement": "A. GukiZ and Contesttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputProfessor GukiZ likes programming contests. He especially likes to rate his students on the contests he prepares. Now, he has decided to prepare a new contest.In total,nstudents will attend, and before the start, every one of them has some positive integer rating. Students are indexed from1ton. Let's denote the rating ofi-th student asai. After the contest ends, every student will end up with some positive integer position. GukiZ expects that his students will take places according to their ratings.He thinks that each student will take place equal to. In particular, if studentAhas rating strictly lower then studentB,Awill get the strictly better position thanB, and if two students have equal ratings, they will share the same position.GukiZ would like you to reconstruct the results by following his expectations. Help him and determine the position after the end of the contest for each of his students if everything goes as expected.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 2000), number of GukiZ's students.The second line containsnnumbersa1,a2, ...an(1 ≤ai≤ 2000) whereaiis the rating ofi-th student (1 ≤i≤n).OutputIn a single line, print the position after the end of the contest for each ofnstudents in the same order as they appear in the input.ExamplesInput31 3 3Output3 1 1Input11Output1Input53 5 3 4 5Output4 1 4 3 1NoteIn the first sample, students2and3are positioned first (there is no other student with higher rating), and student1is positioned third since there are two students with higher rating.In the second sample, first student is the only one on the contest.In the third sample, students2and5share the first position with highest rating, student4is next with third position, and students1and3are the last sharing fourth position.",
