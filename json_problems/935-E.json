Fafa and Ancient Mathematicstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAncient Egyptians are known to have understood difficult concepts in mathematics. The ancient Egyptian mathematician Ahmes liked to write a kind of arithmetic expressions on papyrus paper which he called asAhmes arithmetic expression.AnAhmes arithmetic expressioncan be defined as:\"d\" is an Ahmes arithmetic expression, wheredis a one-digit positive integer;\"(E1opE2)\" is an Ahmes arithmetic expression, whereE1andE2are valid Ahmes arithmetic expressions (without spaces) andopis either plus( + )or minus( - ).For example5,(1-1)and((1+(2-3))-5)are valid Ahmes arithmetic expressions.On his trip to Egypt, Fafa found a piece of papyrus paper having one of these Ahmes arithmetic expressions written on it. Being very ancient, the papyrus piece was very worn out. As a result, all the operators were erased, keeping only the numbers and the brackets. Since Fafa loves mathematics, he decided to challenge himself with the following task:Given the number of plus and minus operators in the original expression, find out the maximum possible value for the expression on the papyrus paper after putting the plus and minus operators in the place of the original erased operators.InputThe first line contains a stringE(1 ≤ |E| ≤ 104)— a valid Ahmes arithmetic expression. All operators are erased and replaced with '?'.The second line contains two space-separated integersPandM(0 ≤min(P,M) ≤ 100) — the number of plus and minus operators, respectively.It is guaranteed thatP+M=the number of erased operators.OutputPrint one line containing the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput(1?1)1 0Output2Input(2?(1?2))1 1Output1Input((1?(5?7))?((6?2)?7))3 2Output18Input((1?(5?7))?((6?2)?7))2 3Output16NoteThe first sample will be(1 + 1)  =  2.The second sample will be(2 + (1 - 2))  =  1.The third sample will be((1 - (5 - 7)) + ((6 + 2) + 7))  =  18.The fourth sample will be((1 + (5 + 7)) - ((6 - 2) - 7))  =  16.",
