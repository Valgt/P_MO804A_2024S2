Ehab's REAL Number Theory Problemtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ that has a special condition: every element in this array has at most 7 divisors. Find the length of the shortest non-empty subsequence of this array product of whose elements is a perfect square.A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of an array $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\\\\ldots$$$, $$$a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputOutput the length of the shortest non-empty subsequence of $$$a$$$ product of whose elements is a perfect square. If there are several shortest subsequences, you can find any of them. If there's no such subsequence, print \"-1\".ExamplesInput3 1 4 6Output1Input4 2 3 6 6Output2Input3 6 15 10Output3Input4 2 3 5 7Output-1NoteIn the first sample, you can choose a subsequence $$$[1]$$$.In the second sample, you can choose a subsequence $$$[6, 6]$$$.In the third sample, you can choose a subsequence $$$[6, 15, 10]$$$.In the fourth sample, there is no such subsequence.",
