Vasya And The Mushroomstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya's house is situated in a forest, and there is a mushroom glade near it. The glade consists of two rows, each of which can be divided intonconsecutive cells. For each cell Vasya knows how fast the mushrooms grow in this cell (more formally, how many grams of mushrooms grow in this cell each minute). Vasya spends exactly one minute to move to some adjacent cell. Vasya cannot leave the glade. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a common side. When Vasya enters some cell, he instantly collects all the mushrooms growing there.Vasya begins his journey in the left upper cell. Every minute Vasya must move to some adjacent cell, he cannot wait for the mushrooms to grow. He wants to visit all the cellsexactly onceand maximize the total weight of the collected mushrooms. Initially, all mushrooms have a weight of0. Note that Vasya doesn't need to return to the starting cell.Help Vasya! Calculate the maximum total weight of mushrooms he can collect.InputThe first line contains the numbern(1 ≤n≤ 3·105)— the length of the glade.The second line containsnnumbersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 106)— the growth rate of mushrooms in the first row of the glade.The third line containsnnumbersb1,b2, ...,bn(1 ≤bi≤ 106)is the growth rate of mushrooms in the second row of the glade.OutputOutput one number — the maximum total weight of mushrooms that Vasya can collect by choosing the optimal route. Pay attention that Vasya must visit every cell of the gladeexactly once.ExamplesInput31 2 36 5 4Output70Input31 1000 1000010 100 100000Output543210NoteIn the first test case, the optimal route is as follows:Thus, the collected weight of mushrooms will be0·1 + 1·2 + 2·3 + 3·4 + 4·5 + 5·6 = 70.In the second test case, the optimal route is as follows:Thus, the collected weight of mushrooms will be0·1 + 1·10 + 2·100 + 3·1000 + 4·10000 + 5·100000 = 543210.",
