Recently his mom has presented him a positive integera. There's only one thing Petya likes more than numbers: playing with little Masha. It turned out that Masha already has a positive integerb. Petya decided to turn his numberainto the numberbconsecutively performing the operations of the following two types:Subtract 1 from his number.Choose any integerxfrom2tok, inclusive. Then subtract number(amodx)from his numbera. Operationamodxmeans taking the remainder from division of numberaby numberx.Petya performs one operation per second. Each time he chooses an operation to perform during the current move, no matter what kind of operations he has performed by that moment. In particular, this implies that he can perform the same operation any number of times in a row.Now he wonders in what minimum number of seconds he could transform his numberainto numberb. Please note that numbersxin the operations of the second type are selected anew each time, independently of each other.InputThe only line contains three integersa,b(1 ≤b≤a≤ 1018) andk(2 ≤k≤ 15).Please do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.OutputPrint a single integer — the required minimum number of seconds needed to transform numberainto numberb.ExamplesInput10 1 4Output6Input6 3 10Output2Input1000000000000000000 1 3Output666666666666666667NoteIn the first sample the sequence of numbers that Petya gets as he tries to obtain numberbis as follows: 10→8→6→4→3→2→1.In the second sample one of the possible sequences is as follows: 6→4→3.",
