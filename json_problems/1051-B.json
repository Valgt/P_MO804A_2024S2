Relatively Prime Pairstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a set of all integers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive, $$$l < r$$$, $$$(r - l + 1) \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ and $$$(r - l)$$$ is always odd.You want to split these numbers into exactly $$$\\\\frac{r - l + 1}{2}$$$ pairs in such a way that for each pair $$$(i, j)$$$ the greatest common divisor of $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ is equal to $$$1$$$. Each number should appear in exactly one of the pairs.Print the resulting pairs or output that no solution exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.InputThe only line contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l < r \\\\le 10^{18}$$$, $$$r - l + 1 \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$(r - l)$$$ is odd).OutputIf any solution exists, print \"YES\" in the first line. Each of the next $$$\\\\frac{r - l + 1}{2}$$$ lines should contain some pair of integers.GCDof numbers in each pair should be equal to $$$1$$$. All $$$(r - l + 1)$$$ numbers should be pairwise distinct and should have values from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.If there exists no solution, print \"NO\".ExampleInput1 8OutputYES2 74 13 86 5",
