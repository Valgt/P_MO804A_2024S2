Her mother has an array ofnflowers. Each flower has some mood, the mood ofi-th flower isai. The mood can be positive, zero or negative.Let's define a subarray as a segment of consecutive flowers. The mother suggested some set of subarrays. Alyona wants to choose several of the subarrays suggested by her mother. After that, each of the flowers will add to the girl's happiness its mood multiplied by the number of chosen subarrays the flower is in.For example, consider the case when the mother has5flowers, and their moods are equal to1,  - 2, 1, 3,  - 4. Suppose the mother suggested subarrays(1,  - 2),(3,  - 4),(1, 3),(1,  - 2, 1, 3). Then if the girl chooses the third and the fourth subarrays then:the first flower adds1·1 = 1to the girl's happiness, because he is in one of chosen subarrays,the second flower adds( - 2)·1 =  - 2, because he is in one of chosen subarrays,the third flower adds1·2 = 2, because he is in two of chosen subarrays,the fourth flower adds3·2 = 6, because he is in two of chosen subarrays,the fifth flower adds( - 4)·0 = 0, because he is in no chosen subarrays.Thus, in total1 + ( - 2) + 2 + 6 + 0 = 7is added to the girl's happiness. Alyona wants to choose such subarrays from those suggested by the mother that the value added to her happiness would be as large as possible. Help her do this!Alyona can choose any number of the subarrays, even0or all suggested by her mother.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 100) — the number of flowers and the number of subarrays suggested by the mother.The second line contains the flowers moods —nintegersa1,a2, ...,an(- 100 ≤ai≤ 100).The nextmlines contain the description of the subarrays suggested by the mother. Thei-th of these lines contain two integersliandri(1 ≤li≤ri≤n) denoting the subarraya[li],a[li+ 1], ...,a[ri].Each subarray can encounter more than once.OutputPrint single integer — the maximum possible value added to the Alyona's happiness.ExamplesInput5 41 -2 1 3 -41 24 53 41 4Output7Input4 31 2 3 41 32 41 1Output16Input2 2-1 -21 11 2Output0NoteThe first example is the situation described in the statements.In the second example Alyona should choose all subarrays.The third example has answer0because Alyona can choose none of the subarrays.",
