Sereja and Subsequencestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutSereja has a sequence that consists ofnpositive integers,a1,a2, ...,an.First Sereja took a piece of squared paper and wrote alldistinctnon-empty non-decreasing subsequences of sequencea. Then for each sequence written on the squared paper, Sereja wrote on a piece of lines paper all sequences thatdo not exceedit.A sequence of positive integersx=x1,x2, ...,xrdoesn't exceed a sequence of positive integersy=y1,y2, ...,yr, if the following inequation holds:x1≤y1,x2≤y2, ...,xr≤yr.Now Sereja wonders, how many sequences are written on the lines piece of paper. Help Sereja, find the required quantity modulo1000000007(109+ 7).InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105). The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 106).OutputIn the single line print the answer to the problem modulo1000000007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput142Output42Input31 2 2Output13Input51 2 3 4 5Output719",
