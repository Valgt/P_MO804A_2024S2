Let's consider the alphabet consisting of $$$k$$$ different elements.Letbeauty$$$f(s)$$$ of the string $$$s$$$ be the number of indexes $$$i$$$, $$$1\\\\le i<|s|$$$, for which prefix of $$$s$$$ of length $$$i$$$ equals to suffix of $$$s$$$ of length $$$i$$$. For example, beauty of the string $$$abacaba$$$ equals $$$2$$$, as for $$$i = 1, 3$$$ prefix and suffix of length $$$i$$$ are equal.Consider all words of length $$$n$$$ in the given alphabet. Find the expected value of $$$f(s)^2$$$ of a uniformly chosen at random word. We can show that it can be expressed as $$$\\\\frac{P}{Q}$$$, where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are coprime and $$$Q$$$ isn't divided by $$$10^9 + 7$$$.
