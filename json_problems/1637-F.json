Towerstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The height of the $$$i$$$-th vertex is $$$h_i$$$. You can place any number of towers into vertices, for each tower you can choose which vertex to put it in, as well as choose its efficiency. Setting up a tower with efficiency $$$e$$$ costs $$$e$$$ coins, where $$$e > 0$$$.It is considered that a vertex $$$x$$$ gets a signal if for some pair of towers at the vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$u \\\\neq v$$$, but it is allowed that $$$x = u$$$ or $$$x = v$$$) with efficiencies $$$e_u$$$ and $$$e_v$$$, respectively, it is satisfied that $$$\\\\min(e_u, e_v) \\\\geq h_x$$$ and $$$x$$$ lies on the path between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.Find the minimum number of coins required to set up towers so that you can get a signal at all vertices.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 200\\\\,000$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le h_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the heights of the vertices.Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contain a pair of numbers $$$v_i, u_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v_i, u_i \\\\le n$$$) — an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum required number of coins.ExamplesInput3 1 2 1 1 2 2 3Output4Input5 1 3 3 1 3 1 3 5 4 4 3 2 3Output7Input2 6 1 1 2Output12NoteIn the first test case it's optimal to install two towers with efficiencies $$$2$$$ at vertices $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$.In the second test case it's optimal to install a tower with efficiency $$$1$$$ at vertex $$$1$$$ and two towers with efficiencies $$$3$$$ at vertices $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$.In the third test case it's optimal to install two towers with efficiencies $$$6$$$ at vertices $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$.",
