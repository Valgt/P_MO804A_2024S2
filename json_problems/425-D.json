The coordinates of each point are integers. Now he is wondering: how many squares are there with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with points painted in all its four vertexes? Help him, calculate this number.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105). Each of the nextnlines contains two integersxi,yi(0 ≤xi,yi≤ 105), the integers represent the coordinates of thei-th point. It is guaranteed that all the given points are distinct.OutputIn a single line print the required number of squares.ExamplesInput50 00 22 02 21 1Output1Input90 01 12 20 11 00 22 01 22 1Output5",
