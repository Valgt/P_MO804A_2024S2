Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given $$$n$$$ days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.The flower grows as follows:If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies.If the flower is watered in the $$$i$$$-th day, it grows by $$$1$$$ centimeter.If the flower is watered in the $$$i$$$-th and in the $$$(i-1)$$$-th day ($$$i > 1$$$), then it grows by $$$5$$$ centimeters instead of $$$1$$$.If the flower is not watered in the $$$i$$$-th day, it does not grow.At the beginning of the $$$1$$$-st day the flower is $$$1$$$ centimeter tall. What is its height after $$$n$$$ days?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains the only integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i = 0$$$ or $$$a_i = 1$$$). If $$$a_i = 1$$$, the flower is watered in the $$$i$$$-th day, otherwise it is not watered.OutputFor each test case print a single integer $$$k$$$ â€” the flower's height after $$$n$$$ days, or $$$-1$$$, if the flower dies.ExampleInput4 3 1 0 1 3 0 1 1 4 1 0 0 1 1 0Output3 7 -1 1",
