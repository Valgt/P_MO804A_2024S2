There are riots on the streets... Famous Uzhlyandian superheroes Shean the Sheep and Stas the Giraffe were called in order to save the situation. Upon the arriving, they found that citizens are worried about maximum values of the Main Uzhlyandian Functionf, which is defined as follows:In the above formula,1 ≤l<r≤nmust hold, wherenis the size of the Main Uzhlyandian Arraya, and|x|means absolute value ofx. But the heroes skipped their math lessons in school, so they asked you for help. Help them calculate the maximum value offamong all possible values oflandrfor the given arraya.InputThe first line contains single integern(2 ≤n≤ 105) — the size of the arraya.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(-109≤ai≤ 109) — the array elements.OutputPrint the only integer — the maximum value off.ExamplesInput51 4 2 3 1Output3Input41 5 4 7Output6NoteIn the first sample case, the optimal value offis reached on intervals[1, 2]and[2, 5].In the second case maximal value offis reachable only on the whole array.",
