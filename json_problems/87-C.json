Interesting Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutTwo best friends Serozha and Gena play a game.Initially there is one pile consisting ofnstones on the table. During one move one pile should be taken and divided into an arbitrary number of piles consisting ofa1>a2> ... >ak> 0stones. The piles should meet the conditiona1-a2=a2-a3= ... =ak- 1-ak= 1. Naturally, the number of pileskshould be no less than two.The friends play in turns. The player who cannot make a move loses. Serozha makes the first move. Who will win if both players play in the optimal way?InputThe single line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 105).OutputIf Serozha wins, printk, which represents the minimal number of piles into which he can split the initial one during the first move in order to win the game.If Gena wins, print \"-1\" (without the quotes).ExamplesInput3Output2Input6Output-1Input100Output8",
