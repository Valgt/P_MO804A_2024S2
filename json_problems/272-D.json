Dima and Two Sequencestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLittle Dima has two sequences of points with integer coordinates: sequence(a1, 1), (a2, 2), ..., (an,n)and sequence(b1, 1), (b2, 2), ..., (bn,n).Now Dima wants to count the number of distinct sequences of points of length2·nthat can be assembled from these sequences, such that thex-coordinates of points in the assembled sequence willnot decrease. Help him with that. Note that each element of the initial sequences should be used exactly once in the assembled sequence.Dima considers two assembled sequences(p1,q1), (p2,q2), ..., (p2·n,q2·n)and(x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (x2·n,y2·n)distinct, if there is suchi(1 ≤i≤ 2·n), that(pi,qi) ≠ (xi,yi).As the answer can be rather large, print the remainder from dividing the answer by numberm.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105). The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109). The third line containsnintegersb1,b2, ...,bn(1 ≤bi≤ 109). The numbers in the lines are separated by spaces.The last line contains integerm(2 ≤m≤ 109+ 7).OutputIn the single line print the remainder after dividing the answer to the problem by numberm.ExamplesInput1127Output1Input21 22 311Output2NoteIn the first sample you can get only one sequence:(1, 1), (2, 1).In the second sample you can get such sequences :(1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2);(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2).
