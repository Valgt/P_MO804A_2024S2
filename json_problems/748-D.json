There was his birthday recently.kof his friends came to him to congratulate him, and each of them presented to him a stringsihaving the same lengthn. We denote the beauty of thei-th string byai. It can happen thataiis negative — that means that Santa doesn't find this string beautiful at all.Santa Claus is crazy about palindromes. He is thinking about the following question: what is the maximum possible total beauty of a palindrome which can be obtained by concatenating some (possibly all) of the strings he has? Each present can be used at most once. Note that all strings havethe same lengthn.Recall that a palindrome is a string that doesn't change after one reverses it.Since the empty string is a palindrome too, the answer can't be negative. Even if allai's are negative, Santa can obtain the empty string.InputThe first line contains two positive integerskandndivided by space and denoting the number of Santa friends and the length of every string they've presented, respectively (1 ≤k,n≤ 100 000;n·k≤ 100 000).klines follow. Thei-th of them contains the stringsiand its beautyai(- 10 000 ≤ai≤ 10 000). The string consists ofnlowercase English letters, and its beauty is integer. Some of strings may coincide. Also, equal strings can have different beauties.OutputIn the only line print the required maximum possible beauty.ExamplesInput7 3abb 2aaa -3bba -1zyz -4abb 5aaa 7xyx 4Output12Input3 1a 1a 2a 3Output6Input2 5abcde 10000abcde 10000Output0NoteIn the first example Santa can obtainabbaaaxyxaaabbaby concatenating strings5,2,7,6and3(in this order).",
