A line containing the origin is called good, if projection of the given set to this line forms a symmetric multiset of points. Find the total number of good lines.Multiset is a set where equal elements are allowed.Multiset is called symmetric, if there is a pointPon the plane such that the multiset iscentrally symmetricin respect of pointP.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 2000) — the number of points in the set.Each of the nextnlines contains two integersxiandyi(- 106≤xi,yi≤  106) — the coordinates of the points. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide.OutputIf there are infinitely many good lines, print-1.Otherwise, print single integer — the number of good lines.ExamplesInput31 22 13 3Output3Input24 31 2Output-1NotePicture to the first sample test:In the second sample, any line containing the origin is good.",
