Besides, it consists of only one room. The room is divided intonrows, each row consists ofmseats.There arekpeople lined up to the box office, each person wants to buy exactly one ticket for his own entertainment. Before the box office started selling tickets, each person found the seat that seemed best for him and remembered it as a pair of coordinates(xi,yi), wherexiis the row number, andyiis the seat number in this row.It is possible that some people have chosen the same place, then when some people see their favorite seat taken in the plan of empty seats in the theater, they choose and buy a ticket to another place. Each of them has the following logic: let's assume that he originally wanted to buy a ticket to seat(x1,y1), then when he comes to the box office, he chooses such empty seat(x2,y2), which satisfies the following conditions:the value of|x1-x2| + |y1-y2|is minimumif the choice is not unique, then among the seats that satisfy the first condition, this person selects the one for which the value ofx2is minimumif the choice is still not unique, among the seats that satisfy the first and second conditions, this person selects the one for which the value ofy2is minimumYour task is to find the coordinates of a seat for each person.InputThe first input line contains three integersn,m,k(1 ≤n,m≤ 2000,1 ≤k≤min(n·m, 105) — the number of rows in the room, the number of seats in each row and the number of people in the line, correspondingly. Each of the nextklines contains two integersxi,yi(1 ≤xi≤n,1 ≤yi≤m) — the coordinates of the seat each person has chosen. Numbers on the same line are separated by a space. The pairs of coordinates are located in the order, in which people stand in the line, starting from the head (the first person in the line who stands in front of the box office) to the tail (the last person in the line).OutputPrintklines, each containing a pair of integers. Print on thei-th linexi,yi— the coordinates of the seat, for which the person who standsi-th in the line will buy the ticket.ExamplesInput3 4 61 11 11 11 21 31 3Output1 11 22 11 31 42 3Input4 3 122 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 2Output2 21 22 12 33 21 11 33 13 34 24 14 3",
