Minus and Minus Give Plustime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEveryone knows that two consecutive (adjacent) \"minus\" signs can be replaced with a single \"plus\" sign.You are given the string $$$s$$$, consisting of \"plus\" and \"minus\" signs only. Zero or more operations can be performed with it. In each operation you can choose any two adjacent \"minus\" signs, and replace them with a single \"plus\" sign. Thus, in one operation, the length of the string is reduced by exactly $$$1$$$.You are given two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$. Determine if you can use $$$0$$$ or more operations to get the string $$$t$$$ from the string $$$s$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^5$$$), denoting the number of test cases in the input. The following lines contain descriptions of the test sets, each set consists of two lines. First comes the line containing $$$s$$$ (the length of the line $$$s$$$ does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$), then comes the line containing $$$t$$$ (the length of the line $$$t$$$ does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$). The lines $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ are non-empty, and they contain only \"plus\" and \"minus\" signs.The sum of the lengths of lines $$$s$$$ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$. Similarly, the sum of the lengths of lines $$$t$$$ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$k$$$ lines: the $$$i$$$-th line must containYESif the answer to the $$$i$$$-th test case is positive, otherwiseNO. PrintYESandNOusing uppercase letters only.ExampleInput5 -+--+ -+++ -------- -+--+- - + -- --- +++ +++OutputYES YES NO NO YES",
