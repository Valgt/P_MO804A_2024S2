The goal is to make a simple polyline, without self-intersections and self-touches, such that it passes through all these points. Also, the polyline must consist of only segments parallel to the coordinate axes. You are to find the minimum number of segments this polyline may consist of.InputEach of the three lines of the input contains two integers. Thei-th line contains integersxiandyi(- 109≤xi,yi≤ 109) — the coordinates of thei-th point. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct.OutputPrint a single number — the minimum possible number of segments of the polyline.ExamplesInput1 -11 11 2Output1Input-1 -1-1 34 3Output2Input1 12 33 2Output3NoteThe variant of the polyline in the first sample:The variant of the polyline in the second sample:The variant of the polyline in the third sample:",
