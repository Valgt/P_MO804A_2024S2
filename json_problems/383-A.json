There arencows sitting in a row, numbered from1tonfrom left to right. Each cow is either facing to the left or facing to the right. When Iahub milks a cow, all the cows that see the current cow get scared and lose one unit of the quantity of milk that they can give. A cow facing left sees all the cows with lower indices than her index, and a cow facing right sees all the cows with higher indices than her index. A cow that got scared once can get scared again (and lose one more unit of milk). A cow that has been milked once cannot get scared and lose any more milk. You can assume that a cow never loses all the milk she can give (a cow gives an infinitely amount of milk).Iahub can decide the order in which he milks the cows. But he must milk each cow exactly once. Iahub wants to lose as little milk as possible. Print the minimum amount of milk that is lost.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 200000).
