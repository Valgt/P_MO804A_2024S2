Polygontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolygon is not only the best platform for developing problems but also a square matrix with side $$$n$$$, initially filled with the character0.On the polygon, military training was held. The soldiers placed a cannon above each cell in the first row and a cannon to the left of each cell in the first column. Thus, exactly $$$2n$$$ cannons were placed.Initial polygon for $$$n=4$$$.Cannons shoot character1. At any moment of time, no more than one cannon is shooting. When a1flies out of a cannon, it flies forward (in the direction of the shot) until it collides with a polygon border or another1. After that, it takes the cell in which it was before the collision and remains there. Take a look at the examples for better understanding.More formally:if a cannon stands in the row $$$i$$$, to the left of the first column, and shoots with a1, then the1starts its flight from the cell ($$$i, 1$$$) and ends in some cell ($$$i, j$$$);if a cannon stands in the column $$$j$$$, above the first row, and shoots with a1, then the1starts its flight from the cell ($$$1, j$$$) and ends in some cell ($$$i, j$$$).For example, consider the following sequence of shots:1. Shoot the cannon in the row $$$2$$$.                         2. Shoot the cannon in the row $$$2$$$.                         3. Shoot the cannon in column $$$3$$$.You have a report from the military training on your desk. This report is a square matrix with side length $$$n$$$ consisting of0and1. You wonder if the training actually happened. In other words, is there a sequence of shots such that, after the training, you get the given matrix?Each cannon can make an arbitrary number of shots. Before the training, each cell of the polygon contains0.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case starts with a line containing an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$) — the size of the polygon.This is followed by $$$n$$$ lines of length $$$n$$$, consisting of0and1— the polygon matrix after the training.The total area of the matrices in all test cases in one test does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print:YESif there is a sequence of shots leading to a given matrix;NOif such a sequence does not exist.The letters in the wordsYESandNOcan be printed in any case.ExampleInput5 4 0010 0011 0000 0000 2 10 01 2 00 00 4 0101 1111 0101 0111 4 0100 1110 0101 0111OutputYES NO YES YES NONoteThe first test case was explained in the statement.The answer to the second test case isNO, since a1in a cell ($$$1, 1$$$) flying out of any cannon would continue its flight further.",
