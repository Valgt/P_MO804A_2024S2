You havenslimes all initially with value1.You are going to play a game with these slimes. Initially, you put a single slime by itself in a row. Then, you will add the othern- 1slimes one by one. When you add a slime, you place it at the right of all already placed slimes. Then, while the last two slimes in the row have the same valuev, you combine them together to create a slime with valuev+ 1.You would like to see what the final state of the row is after you've added allnslimes. Please print the values of the slimes in the row from left to right.InputThe first line of the input will contain a single integer,n(1 ≤n≤ 100 000).OutputOutput a single line withkintegers, wherekis the number of slimes in the row after you've finished the procedure described in the problem statement. Thei-th of these numbers should be the value of thei-th slime from the left.ExamplesInput1Output1Input2Output2Input3Output2 1Input8Output4NoteIn the first sample, we only have a single slime with value1. The final state of the board is just a single slime with value1.In the second sample, we perform the following steps:Initially we place a single slime in a row by itself. Thus, row is initially1.Then, we will add another slime. The row is now1 1. Since two rightmost slimes have the same values, we should replace these slimes with one with value2. Thus, the final state of the board is2.In the third sample, after adding the first two slimes, our row is2. After adding one more slime, the row becomes2 1.In the last sample, the steps look as follows:122 133 13 23 2 14",
