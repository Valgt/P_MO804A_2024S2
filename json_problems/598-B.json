Each query is described by two 1-based indicesli,riand integerki. It means that you should cyclically shift the substrings[li...ri]kitimes. The queries should be processed one after another in the order they are given.One operation of a cyclic shift (rotation) is equivalent to moving the last character to the position of the first character and shifting all other characters one position to the right.For example, if the stringsisabacabaand the query isl1= 3,r1= 6,k1= 1then the answer isabbacaa. If after that we would process the queryl2= 1,r2= 4,k2= 2then we would get the stringbaabcaa.InputThe first line of the input contains the strings(1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10 000) in its initial state, where|s|stands for the length ofs. It contains only lowercase English letters.Second line contains a single integerm(1 ≤m≤ 300) — the number of queries.Thei-th of the nextmlines contains three integersli,riandki(1 ≤li≤ri≤ |s|, 1 ≤ki≤ 1 000 000) — the description of thei-th query.OutputPrint the resulting stringsafter processing allmqueries.ExamplesInputabacaba23 6 11 4 2OutputbaabcaaNoteThe sample is described in problem statement.",
