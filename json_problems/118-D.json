Overall the army hadn1footmen andn2horsemen. Caesar thought that an arrangement isnotbeautiful if somewhere in the line there are strictly more thatk1footmen standing successively one after another, or there are strictly more thank2horsemen standing successively one after another. Find the number ofbeautifularrangements of the soldiers.Note that alln1+n2warriors should be present at each arrangement. All footmen are considered indistinguishable among themselves. Similarly, all horsemen are considered indistinguishable among themselves.InputThe only line contains four space-separated integersn1,n2,k1,k2(1 ≤n1,n2≤ 100, 1 ≤k1,k2≤ 10) which represent how many footmen and horsemen there are and the largest acceptable number of footmen and horsemen standing in succession, correspondingly.OutputPrint the number of beautiful arrangements of the army modulo100000000(108). That is, print the number of such ways to line up the soldiers, that no more thank1footmen stand successively, and no more thank2horsemen stand successively.ExamplesInput2 1 1 10Output1Input2 3 1 2Output5Input2 4 1 1Output0NoteLet's mark a footman as1, and a horseman as2.In the first sample the only beautiful line-up is:121In the second sample 5 beautiful line-ups exist:12122,12212,21212,21221,22121",
