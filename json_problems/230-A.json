In the duel between two opponents the duel's outcome is determined by their strength. Initially, Kirito's strength equalss.If Kirito starts duelling with thei-th (1 ≤i≤n) dragon and Kirito's strength is not greater than the dragon's strengthxi, then Kirito loses the duel and dies. But if Kirito's strength is greater than the dragon's strength, then he defeats the dragon and gets a bonus strength increase byyi.Kirito can fight the dragons in any order.

As the first dragon's strength is less than 2, Kirito can fight it and defeat it. After that he gets the bonus and his strength increases to2 + 99 = 101.
