HQ9+time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutHQ9+ is a joke programming language which has only four one-character instructions:\"H\" prints \"Hello, World!\",\"Q\" prints the whole source code of the program itself (at each call),\"9\" prints the lyrics of \"99 Bottles of Beer\" song,\"+\" increments the value stored in the internal accumulator.Instructions \"H\" and \"Q\" are case-sensitive and must be uppercase. The characters of the program which are not instructions are ignored.You are given a program written in HQ9+. You have to figure out whether executing this program will produce any output.InputThe input will consist of a single linepwhich will give a program in HQ9+. Stringpwill contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. ASCII-code of each character ofpwill be between 33 (exclamation mark) and 126 (tilde), inclusive.OutputOutput \"YES\", if executing the program will produce any output, and \"NO\" otherwise (quotes for clarity only).ExamplesInputHello!OutputYESInputVK_Cup_2012!OutputNONoteIn the first case the program contains only one instruction â€” \"H\", which prints \"Hello, World!\".In the second case none of the program characters are language instructions.",
