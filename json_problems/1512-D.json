Corrupted Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a number $$$n$$$ and an array $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_{n+2}$$$, obtained according to the following algorithm:some array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ was guessed;array $$$a$$$ was written to array $$$b$$$, i.e. $$$b_i = a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$);The $$$(n+1)$$$-th element of the array $$$b$$$ is the sum of the numbers in the array $$$a$$$, i.e. $$$b_{n+1} = a_1+a_2+\\\\ldots+a_n$$$;The $$$(n+2)$$$-th element of the array $$$b$$$ was written some number $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^9$$$), i.e. $$$b_{n+2} = x$$$; Thearray $$$b$$$ was shuffled.For example, the array $$$b=[2, 3, 7, 12 ,2]$$$ it could be obtained in the following ways:$$$a=[2, 2, 3]$$$ and $$$x=12$$$;$$$a=[3, 2, 7]$$$ and $$$x=2$$$.For the given array $$$b$$$, find any array $$$a$$$ that could have been guessed initially.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second row of each test case contains $$$n+2$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_{n+2}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output:\"-1\", if the array $$$b$$$ could not be obtained from any array $$$a$$$;$$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$, otherwise.If there are several arrays of $$$a$$$, you can output any.ExampleInput4 3 2 3 7 12 2 4 9 1 7 1 6 5 5 18 2 2 3 2 9 2 3 2 6 9 2 1Output2 3 7  -1 2 2 2 3 9  1 2 6",
