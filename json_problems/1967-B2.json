You may want to read both versions. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$.Calculate the number of ordered pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ satisfying the following conditions:$$$1\\\\le a\\\\le n$$$, $$$1\\\\le b\\\\le m$$$;$$$b \\\\cdot \\\\gcd(a,b)$$$ is a multiple of $$$a+b$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n,m\\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^6$$$).It is guaranteed that neither the sum of $$$n$$$ nor the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases exceeds $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.ExampleInput61 12 33 510 8100 12331000000 1145141Output0 1 1 6 423 5933961NoteIn the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.In the fourth test case, $$$(2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8)$$$ satisfy the conditions.",
