Polycarp's Picture Gallerytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutPolycarp loves not only to take pictures, but also to show his photos to friends. On his personal website he has recently installed a widget that can displaynphotos with the scroll option. At each moment of time the widget displays exactly one photograph with the option showing the previous/next one. From the first photo, you can switch to the second one or to then-th one, from the second photo you can switch to the third one or to the first one, etc. Thus, navigation is performed in a cycle.Polycarp's collection consists ofmphoto albums, thei-th album containsaiphotos. Polycarp wants to choosenphotos and put them on a new widget. To make watching the photos interesting to the visitors, he is going to post pictures so that no two photos from one album were neighboring (each photo will have exactly two neighbors, the first photo's neighbors are the second and then-th one).Help Polycarp compile a photo gallery. Selectnphotos from his collection and put them in such order that no two photos from one album went one after the other.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(3 ≤n≤ 1000,1 ≤m≤ 40), wherenis the number of photos on the widget, andmis the number of albums. The second line containsmintegersa1,a2, ...,am(1 ≤ai≤ 1000), whereaiis the number of photos in thei-th album.OutputPrint the single number-1if there is no solution. Otherwise, printnnumberst1,t2, ...,tn, wheretirepresents the number of the album of thei-th picture in the widget. The albums are numbered from 1 in the order of their appearance in the input. If there are several solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput4 31 3 5Output3 1 3 2Input10 25 5Output2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1Input10 31 10 3Output-1",
