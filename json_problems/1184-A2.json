    "statement": "A2. Heidi Learns Hashing (Medium)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAfter learning about polynomial hashing, Heidi decided to learn about shift-xor hashing. In particular, she came across this interesting problem.Given a bitstring $$$y \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\}^n$$$ find out the number of different $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq k < n$$$) such that there exists $$$x \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\}^n$$$ for which $$$y = x \\\\oplus \\\\mbox{shift}^k(x).$$$In the above, $$$\\\\oplus$$$ is the xor operation and $$$\\\\mbox{shift}^k$$$ is the operation of shifting a bitstring cyclically to the right $$$k$$$ times. For example, $$$001 \\\\oplus 111 = 110$$$ and $$$\\\\mbox{shift}^3(00010010111000) = 00000010010111$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$), the length of the bitstring $$$y$$$.The second line contains the bitstring $$$y$$$.OutputOutput a single integer: the number of suitable values of $$$k$$$.ExampleInput4 1010Output3NoteIn the first example:$$$1100\\\\oplus \\\\mbox{shift}^1(1100) = 1010$$$$$$1000\\\\oplus \\\\mbox{shift}^2(1000) = 1010$$$$$$0110\\\\oplus \\\\mbox{shift}^3(0110) = 1010$$$There is no $$$x$$$ such that $$$x \\\\oplus x = 1010$$$, hence the answer is $$$3$$$.",
