Increasing Sequencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a sequence $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, \\\\ldots, a_{n}$$$. A sequence $$$b_{1}, b_{2}, \\\\ldots, b_{n}$$$ is calledgood, if it satisfies all of the following conditions:$$$b_{i}$$$ is a positive integer for $$$i = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, n$$$;$$$b_{i} \\\\neq a_{i}$$$ for $$$i = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, n$$$;$$$b_{1} < b_{2} < \\\\ldots < b_{n}$$$.Find the minimum value of $$$b_{n}$$$ among all good sequences $$$b_{1}, b_{2}, \\\\ldots, b_{n}$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^{9}$$$).OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the minimum value of $$$b_{n}$$$ among all good sequences $$$b$$$.ExampleInput351 3 2 6 742 3 4 511Output8 4 2NoteIn the first test case, $$$b = [2, 4, 5, 7, 8]$$$ is a good sequence. It can be proved that there is no good $$$b$$$ with $$$b_{5} < 8$$$.In the second test case, $$$b = [1, 2, 3, 4]$$$ is an optimal good sequence.In the third test case, $$$b = [2]$$$ is an optimal good sequence.",
