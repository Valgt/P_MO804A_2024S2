The rules of poker on this website are a bit strange: there are always two players in a hand, there are no bets, and the winner takes1virtual bourle from the loser.Last evening Roma started to play poker. He decided to spend no more thankvirtual bourles — he will stop immediately if the number of his loses exceeds the number of his wins byk. Also Roma will leave the game if he wins enough money for the evening, i.e. if the number of wins exceeds the number of loses byk.Next morning Roma found a piece of paper with a sequence on it representing his results. Roma doesn't remember the results exactly, and some characters in the sequence are written in a way such that it's impossible to recognize this character, so Roma can't recall whether he wonkbourles or he lost.The sequence written by Roma is a stringsconsisting of charactersW(Roma won the corresponding hand),L(Roma lost),D(draw) and?(unknown result). Roma wants to restore anyvalidsequence by changing all?characters toW,LorD. The sequence is calledvalidif all these conditions are met:In the end the absolute difference between the number of wins and loses is equal tok;There is no hand such that the absolute difference before this hand was equal tok.Help Roma to restore any such sequence.InputThe first line contains two numbersn(the length of Roma's sequence) andk(1 ≤n,k≤ 1000).The second line contains the sequencesconsisting of charactersW,L,Dand?.
