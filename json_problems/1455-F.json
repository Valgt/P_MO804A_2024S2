String and Operationstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters are among the first $$$k$$$ lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. You have to perform $$$n$$$ operations with the string.During the $$$i$$$-th operation, you take the character thatinitially occupiedthe $$$i$$$-th position, and performoneof the following actions with it:swap it with the previous character in the string (if it exists). This operation is represented asL;swap it with the next character in the string (if it exists). This operation is represented asR;cyclically change it to the previous character in the alphabet (bbecomesa,cbecomesb, and so on;abecomes the $$$k$$$-th letter of the Latin alphabet). This operation is represented asD;cyclically change it to the next character in the alphabet (abecomesb,bbecomesc, and so on; the $$$k$$$-th letter of the Latin alphabet becomesa). This operation is represented asU;do nothing. This operation is represented as0.For example, suppose the initial string istest, $$$k = 20$$$, and the sequence of operations isURLD. Then the string is transformed as follows:the first operation isU, so we change the underlined letter intestto the next one in the first $$$20$$$ Latin letters, which isa. The string is nowaest;the second operation isR, so we swap the underlined letter with the next one in the stringaest. The string is nowaset;the third operation isL, so we swap the underlined letter with the previous one in the stringaset(note that this is now the $$$2$$$-nd character of the string, but it was initially the $$$3$$$-rd one, so the $$$3$$$-rd operation is performed to it). The resulting string issaet;the fourth operation isD, so we change the underlined letter insaetto the previous one in the first $$$20$$$ Latin letters, which iss. The string is nowsaes.The result of performing the sequence of operations issaes.Given the string $$$s$$$ and the value of $$$k$$$, find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after applying a sequence of operations to $$$s$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 500$$$; $$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le 26$$$).The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ characters. Each character is one of the $$$k$$$ first letters of the Latin alphabet (in lower case).OutputFor each test case, print one line containing the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from $$$s$$$ using one sequence of operations.ExampleInput6 4 2 bbab 7 5 cceddda 6 5 ecdaed 7 4 dcdbdaa 8 3 ccabbaca 5 7 eabbaOutputaaaa baccacd aabdac aabacad aaaaaaaa abadb",
