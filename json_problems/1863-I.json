Redundant Routestime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices labeled $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, n$$$. The length of a simple path in the tree is the number of vertices in it.You are to select a set of simple paths of length at least $$$2$$$ each, but you cannot simultaneously select two distinct paths contained one in another. Find the largest possible size of such a set.Formally, a set $$$S$$$ of vertices is called arouteif it containsat least two verticesand coincides with the set of vertices of a simple path in the tree. A collection of distinct routes is called atimetable. A route $$$S$$$ in a timetable $$$T$$$ is calledredundantif there is a different route $$$S' \\\\in T$$$ such that $$$S \\\\subset S'$$$. A timetable is calledefficientif it contains no redundant routes. Find the largest possible number of routes in an efficient timetable.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 3000$$$).The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u_i, v_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$u_i \\\\neq v_i$$$) — the numbers of vertices connected by the $$$i$$$-th edge.It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.OutputPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput4 1 2 1 3 1 4Output3Input7 2 1 3 2 4 3 5 3 6 4 7 4Output7NoteIn the first example, possible efficient timetables are $$$\\\\{\\\\{1, 2\\\\}, \\\\{1, 3\\\\}, \\\\{1, 4\\\\}\\\\}$$$ and $$$\\\\{\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}, \\\\{1, 2, 4\\\\}, \\\\{1, 3, 4\\\\}\\\\}$$$.In the second example, we can choose $$$\\\\{ \\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}, \\\\{2, 3, 4\\\\}, \\\\{3, 4, 6\\\\}, \\\\{2, 3, 5\\\\}, \\\\{3, 4, 5\\\\}, \\\\{3, 4, 7\\\\}, \\\\{4, 6, 7\\\\}\\\\}$$$.",
