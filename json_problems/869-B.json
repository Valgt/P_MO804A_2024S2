Herea!denotes the factorial of integera, that is,a! = 1 × 2 × ... ×a. Specifically,0! = 1.Koyomi doesn't care much about this, but before he gets into another mess with oddities, he is interested in the number of times the phoenix will reincarnate in a timespan ofb!years, that is,. Note that whenb≥athis value is always integer.As the answer can be quite large, it would be enough for Koyomi just to knowthe last digit of the answer in decimal representation. And you're here to provide Koyomi with this knowledge.InputThe first and only line of input contains two space-separated integersaandb(0 ≤a≤b≤ 1018).OutputOutput one line containing a single decimal digit — the last digit of the value that interests Koyomi.ExamplesInput2 4Output2Input0 10Output0Input107 109Output2NoteIn the first example, the last digit ofis2;In the second example, the last digit ofis0;In the third example, the last digit ofis2.",
