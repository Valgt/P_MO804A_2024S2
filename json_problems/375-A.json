Divisible by Seventime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYou have numbera, whose decimal representation quite luckily contains digits 1, 6, 8, 9. Rearrange the digits in its decimal representation so that the resulting number will be divisible by 7.Numberadoesn't contain any leading zeroes and contains digits 1, 6, 8, 9 (it also can contain another digits). The resulting number also mustn't contain any leading zeroes.InputThe first line contains positive integerain the decimal record. It is guaranteed that the record of numberacontains digits: 1, 6, 8, 9. Numberadoesn't contain any leading zeroes. The decimal representation of numberacontains at least4and at most106characters.OutputPrint a number in the decimal notation without leading zeroes â€” the result of the permutation.If it is impossible to rearrange the digits of the numberain the required manner, print 0.ExamplesInput1689Output1869Input18906Output18690",
