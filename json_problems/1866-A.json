Ambitious Kidtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputChaneka, Pak Chanek's child, is an ambitious kid, so Pak Chanek gives her the following problem to test her ambition.Given an array of integers $$$[A_1, A_2, A_3, \\\\ldots, A_N]$$$. In one operation, Chaneka can choose one element, then increase or decrease the element's value by $$$1$$$. Chaneka can do that operation multiple times, even for different elements.What is the minimum number of operations that must be done to make it such that $$$A_1 \\\\times A_2 \\\\times A_3 \\\\times \\\\ldots \\\\times A_N = 0$$$?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$N$$$ integers $$$A_1, A_2, A_3, \\\\ldots, A_N$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\\\leq A_i \\\\leq 10^5$$$).OutputAn integer representing the minimum number of operations that must be done to make it such that $$$A_1 \\\\times A_2 \\\\times A_3 \\\\times \\\\ldots \\\\times A_N = 0$$$.ExamplesInput3 2 -6 5Output2Input1 -3Output3Input5 0 -1 0 1 0Output0NoteIn the first example, initially, $$$A_1\\\\times A_2\\\\times A_3=2\\\\times(-6)\\\\times5=-60$$$. Chaneka can do the following sequence of operations:Decrease the value of $$$A_1$$$ by $$$1$$$. Then, $$$A_1\\\\times A_2\\\\times A_3=1\\\\times(-6)\\\\times5=-30$$$Decrease the value of $$$A_1$$$ by $$$1$$$. Then, $$$A_1\\\\times A_2\\\\times A_3=0\\\\times(-6)\\\\times5=0$$$In the third example, Chaneka does not have to do any operations, because from the start, it already holds that $$$A_1\\\\times A_2\\\\times A_3\\\\times A_4\\\\times A_5=0\\\\times(-1)\\\\times0\\\\times1\\\\times0=0$$$",
