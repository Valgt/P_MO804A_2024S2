Choose Your Queriestime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ integers (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$). Initially, they are all zeroes.You have to process $$$q$$$ queries. The $$$i$$$-th query consists of two different integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$. During the $$$i$$$-th query, you have to choose an integer $$$p$$$ (which is either $$$x_i$$$ or $$$y_i$$$) and an integer $$$d$$$ (which is either $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$), and assign $$$a_p = a_p + d$$$.After each query, every element of $$$a$$$ should be a non-negative integer.Process all queries in such a way that the sum of all elements of $$$a$$$ after the last query is the minimum possible.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$ and the number of queries, respectively.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of these lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le n$$$; $$$x_i \\\\ne y_i$$$) — the description of the $$$i$$$-th query.OutputFor each query, print a line containing two characters:the first character should bexif you choose $$$p=x_i$$$, oryif you choose $$$p=y_i$$$;the second character should be+if you choose $$$d=1$$$, or-if you choose $$$d=-1$$$.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput3 41 23 23 11 2Outputy+ x+ x- y-Input4 41 22 33 43 2Outputy+ y+ x- y-Input4 22 14 3Outputy+ x+",
