Less than 5 minutes passed before Iahub remembered of trees from programming. Moreover, he invented a new problem and Iahubina has to solve it, otherwise Iahub won't give her the food.Iahub asks Iahubina: can you build a rooted tree, such thateach internal node (a node with at least one son) has at least two sons;nodeihascinodes in its subtree?Iahubina has to guess the tree. Being a smart girl, she realized that it's possible no tree can follow Iahub's restrictions. In this way, Iahub will eat all the food. You need to help Iahubina: determine if there's at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions.The required tree must containnnodes.InputThe first line of the input contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 24). Next line containsnpositive integers: thei-th number representsci(1 ≤ci≤n).OutputOutput on the first line \"YES\" (without quotes) if there exist at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions, otherwise output \"NO\" (without quotes).ExamplesInput41 1 1 4OutputYESInput51 1 5 2 1OutputNO",
