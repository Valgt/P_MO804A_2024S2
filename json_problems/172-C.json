    "statement": "C. Bustime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThere is a bus stop near the university. The lessons are over, andnstudents come to the stop. Thei-th student will appear at the bus stop at timeti(allti's are distinct).We shall assume that the stop is located on the coordinate axisOx, at pointx= 0, and the bus goes along the rayOx, that is, towards the positive direction of the coordinate axis, and back. Thei-th student needs to get to the point with coordinatexi(xi> 0).The bus moves by the following algorithm. Initially it is at point 0. The students consistently come to the stop and get on it. The bus has a seating capacity which is equal tompassengers. At the moment whenmstudents get on the bus, it starts moving in the positive direction of the coordinate axis. Also it starts moving when the last (n-th) student gets on the bus. The bus is moving at a speed of 1 unit of distance per 1 unit of time, i.e. it covers distanceyin timey.Every time the bus passes the point at which at least one student needs to get off, it stops and these students get off the bus. The students need1 + [k/ 2]units of time to get off the bus, wherekis the number of students who leave at this point. Expression[k/ 2]denotes rounded downk/ 2. As soon as the last student leaves the bus, the bus turns around and goes back to the pointx= 0. It doesn't make any stops until it reaches the point. At the given point the bus fills with students once more, and everything is repeated.If students come to the stop when there's no bus, they form a line (queue) and get on the bus in the order in which they came. Any number of students get on the bus in negligible time, you should assume that it doesn't take any time. Any other actions also take no time. The bus has no other passengers apart from the students.Write a program that will determine for each student the time when he got off the bus. The moment a student got off the bus is the moment the bus stopped at the student's destination stop (despite the fact that the group of students need some time to get off).InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersn,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 105) — the number of students and the number of passengers the bus can transport, correspondingly. Nextnlines contain descriptions of the students, one per line. Each line contains a pair of integersti,xi(1 ≤ti≤ 105, 1 ≤xi≤ 104). The lines are given in the order of strict increasing ofti. Values ofxican coincide.OutputPrintnnumbersw1,w2, ...,wn,wi— the moment of time when thei-th student got off the bus. Print the numbers on one line and separate them with single spaces.ExamplesInput1 103 5Output8Input2 13 54 5Output8 19Input5 43 54 55 56 57 1Output11 11 11 11 20Input20 428 1331 1335 636 452 653 483 284 487 193 6108 4113 6116 1125 2130 2136 13162 2166 4184 1192 2Output51 51 43 40 93 89 86 89 114 121 118 121 137 139 139 152 195 199 193 195NoteIn the first sample the bus waits for the first student for3units of time and drives him to his destination in additional5units of time. So the student leaves the bus at the moment of time3 + 5 = 8.In the second sample the capacity of the bus equals1, that's why it will drive the first student alone. This student is the same as the student from the first sample. So the bus arrives to his destination at the moment of time8, spends1 + [1 / 2] = 1units of time on getting him off, and returns back to0in additional5units of time. That is, the bus returns to the bus stop at the moment of time14. By this moment the second student has already came to the bus stop. So he immediately gets in the bus, and is driven to his destination in additional5units of time. He gets there at the moment14 + 5 = 19.In the third sample the bus waits for the fourth student for6units of time, then drives for5units of time, then gets the passengers off for1 + [4 / 2] = 3units of time, then returns for5units of time, and then drives the fifth student for1unit of time.",
