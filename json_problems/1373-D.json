Maximum Sum on Even Positionstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. Indices of the array start from zero (i. e. the first element is $$$a_0$$$, the second one is $$$a_1$$$, and so on).You can reverseat most onesubarray (continuous subsegment) of this array. Recall that the subarray of $$$a$$$ with borders $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ is $$$a[l; r] = a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\\\dots, a_{r}$$$.Your task is to reverse such a subarray that the sum of elements onevenpositions of the resulting array ismaximized(i. e. the sum of elements $$$a_0, a_2, \\\\dots, a_{2k}$$$ for integer $$$k = \\\\lfloor\\\\frac{n-1}{2}\\\\rfloor$$$ should be maximum possible).You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_0, a_1, \\\\dots, a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer on the separate line — themaximumpossible sum of elements onevenpositions after reversingat most onesubarray (continuous subsegment) of $$$a$$$.ExampleInput4 8 1 7 3 4 7 6 2 9 5 1 2 1 2 1 10 7 8 4 5 7 6 8 9 7 3 4 3 1 2 1Output26 5 37 5",
