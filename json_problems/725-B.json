Food on the Planetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA new airplane SuperPuperJet has an infinite number of rows, numbered with positive integers starting with1from cockpit to tail. There are six seats in each row, denoted with letters from 'a' to 'f'. Seats 'a', 'b' and 'c' are located to the left of an aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit), while seats 'd', 'e' and 'f' are located to the right. Seats 'a' and 'f' are located near the windows, while seats 'c' and 'd' are located near the aisle.It's lunch time and two flight attendants have just started to serve food. They move from the first rows to the tail, always maintaining a distance of two rows from each other because of the food trolley. Thus, at the beginning the first attendant serves row1while the second attendant serves row3. When both rows are done they move one row forward: the first attendant serves row2while the second attendant serves row4. Then they move three rows forward and the first attendant serves row5while the second attendant serves row7. Then they move one row forward again and so on.Flight attendants work with the same speed: it takes exactly1second to serve one passenger and1second to move one row forward. Each attendant first serves the passengers on the seats to the right of the aisle and then serves passengers on the seats to the left of the aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit). Moreover, they always serve passengers in order from the window to the aisle. Thus, the first passenger to receive food in each row is located in seat 'f', and the last one — in seat 'c'. Assume that all seats are occupied.Vasya has seatsin rownand wants to know how many seconds will pass before he gets his lunch.InputThe only line of input contains a description of Vasya's seat in the formatns, wheren(1 ≤n≤ 1018) is the index of the row andsis the seat in this row, denoted as letter from 'a' to 'f'.

As they first serve seats located to the right of the aisle in order from window to aisle, Vasya has to wait3more seconds. The total is6 + 1 + 3 = 10.",
