Working routinetime limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasiliy finally got to work, where there is a huge amount of tasks waiting for him. Vasiliy is given a matrix consisting ofnrows andmcolumns andqtasks. Each task is to swap two submatrices of the given matrix.For each task Vasiliy knows six integersai,bi,ci,di,hi,wi, whereaiis the index of the row where the top-left corner of the first rectangle is located,biis the index of its column,ciis the index of the row of the top-left corner of the second rectangle,diis the index of its column,hiis the height of the rectangle andwiis its width.It's guaranteed that two rectangles in one query do not overlap and do not touch, that is, no cell belongs to both rectangles, and no two cells belonging to different rectanglesshare a side. However, rectangles are allowed to share an angle.Vasiliy wants to know how the matrix will look like after all tasks are performed.InputThe first line of the input contains three integersn,mandq(2 ≤n,m≤ 1000,1 ≤q≤ 10 000) — the number of rows and columns in matrix, and the number of tasks Vasiliy has to perform.Then follownlines containingmintegersvi,j(1 ≤vi,j≤ 109) each — initial values of the cells of the matrix.Each of the followingqlines contains six integersai,bi,ci,di,hi,wi(1 ≤ai,ci,hi≤n,1 ≤bi,di,wi≤m).OutputPrintnlines containingmintegers each — the resulting matrix.ExamplesInput4 4 21 1 2 21 1 2 23 3 4 43 3 4 41 1 3 3 2 23 1 1 3 2 2Output4 4 3 34 4 3 32 2 1 12 2 1 1Input4 2 11 11 12 22 21 1 4 1 1 2Output2 21 12 21 1",
