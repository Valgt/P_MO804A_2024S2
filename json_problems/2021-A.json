    "statement": "A. Meaning Meantime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPak Chanek has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. Since he is currently learning how to calculate the floored average of two numbers, he wants to practice it on his array $$$a$$$.While the array $$$a$$$ has at least two elements, Pak Chanek will perform the following three-step operation:Pick two different indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i, j \\\\leq |a|$$$; $$$i \\\\neq j$$$), note that $$$|a|$$$ denotes the current size of the array $$$a$$$.Append $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{a_i+a_j}{2} \\\\rfloor$$$$$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$$ to the end of the array.Remove elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ from the array and concatenate the remaining parts of the array.For example, suppose that $$$a=[5,4,3,2,1,1]$$$. If we choose $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=5$$$, the resulting array will be $$$a=[4,3,2,1,3]$$$. If we choose $$$i=4$$$ and $$$j=3$$$, the resulting array will be $$$a=[5,4,1,1,2]$$$.After all operations, the array will consist of a single element $$$x$$$. Find the maximum possible value of $$$x$$$ if Pak Chanek performs the operations optimally.$$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$$$$$\\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor$$$ denotes the floor function of $$$x$$$, which is the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $$$x$$$. For example, $$$\\\\lfloor 6 \\\\rfloor = 6$$$, $$$\\\\lfloor 2.5 \\\\rfloor=2$$$, $$$\\\\lfloor -3.6 \\\\rfloor=-4$$$ and $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\pi \\\\rfloor=3$$$InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.Do note that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases is not bounded.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible value of $$$x$$$ after all numbers have been picked.ExampleInput351 7 8 4 532 6 555 5 5 5 5Output6 4 5NoteIn the first test case, the array is initially $$$a=[1,7,8,4,5]$$$. Pak Chanek will perform the following operations:Pick $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=2$$$, then $$$a=[8,4,5,4]$$$.Pick $$$i=3$$$ and $$$j=2$$$, then $$$a=[8,4,4]$$$.Pick $$$i=2$$$ and $$$j=3$$$, then $$$a=[8,4]$$$.Pick $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=2$$$, then $$$a=[6]$$$.After all the operations, the array consists of a single element $$$x=6$$$. It can be proven that there is no series of operations that results in $$$x$$$ greater than $$$6$$$ in the end.",
