Relatively Prime Graphtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call an undirected graph $$$G = (V, E)$$$relatively primeif and only if for each edge $$$(v, u) \\\\in E$$$  $$$GCD(v, u) = 1$$$ (the greatest common divisor of $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ is $$$1$$$). If there is no edge between some pair of vertices $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ then the value of $$$GCD(v, u)$$$ doesn't matter. The vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$|V|$$$.Construct arelatively primegraph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges such that it is connected and it contains neither self-loops nor multiple edges.If there exists no valid graph with the given number of vertices and edges then output\"Impossible\".If there are multiple answers then print any of them.InputThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges.OutputIf there exists no valid graph with the given number of vertices and edges then output\"Impossible\".Otherwise print the answer in the following format:The first line should contain the word\"Possible\".The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines should contain the $$$i$$$-th edge $$$(v_i, u_i)$$$ of the resulting graph ($$$1 \\\\le v_i, u_i \\\\le n, v_i \\\\neq u_i$$$).
