April Fools' Problem (medium)time limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe marmots need to preparekproblems for HC2overndays. Each problem, once prepared, also has to be printed.The preparation of a problem on dayi(at most one per day) costsaiCHF, and the printing of a problem on dayi(also at most one per day) costsbiCHF. Of course, a problem cannot be printed before it has been prepared (but doing both on the same day is fine).What is the minimum cost of preparation and printing?InputThe first line of input contains two space-separated integersnandk(1 ≤k≤n≤ 2200). The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1, ...,an() — the preparation costs.
