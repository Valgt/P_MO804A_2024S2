Multiplicitytime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$.The array $$$b$$$ is called to be asubsequenceof $$$a$$$ if it is possible to remove some elements from $$$a$$$ to get $$$b$$$.Array $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_k$$$ is called to begoodif it is not empty and for every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le k$$$) $$$b_i$$$ is divisible by $$$i$$$.Find the number of good subsequences in $$$a$$$ modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.Two subsequences are considered different if index sets of numbers included in them are different. That is, the values ​of the elements ​do not matter in the comparison of subsequences. In particular, the array $$$a$$$ has exactly $$$2^n - 1$$$ different subsequences (excluding an empty subsequence).InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The next line contains integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$).OutputPrint exactly one integer — the number of good subsequences taken modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExamplesInput21 2Output3Input52 2 1 22 14Output13NoteIn the first example, all three non-empty possible subsequences are good: $$$\\\\{1\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{1, 2\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{2\\\\}$$$In the second example, the possible good subsequences are: $$$\\\\{2\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{2, 2\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{2, 22\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{2, 14\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{2\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{2, 22\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{2, 14\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{1\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{1, 22\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{1, 14\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{22\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{22, 14\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{14\\\\}$$$.Note, that some subsequences are listed more than once, since they occur in the original array multiple times.",
