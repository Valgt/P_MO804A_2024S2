    "statement": "C. Greg and Friendstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutOne day Greg and his friends were walking in the forest. Overall there werenpeople walking, including Greg. Soon he found himself in front of a river. The guys immediately decided to get across the river. Luckily, there was a boat by the river bank, just where the guys were standing. We know that the boat can hold people with the total weight of at mostkkilograms.Greg immediately took a piece of paper and listed there the weights of all people in his group (including himself). It turned out that each person weights either 50 or 100 kilograms. Now Greg wants to know what minimum number of times the boat needs to cross the river to transport the whole group to the other bank. The boat needs at least one person to navigate it from one bank to the other. As the boat crosses the river, it can have any non-zero number of passengers as long as their total weight doesn't exceedk.Also Greg is wondering, how many ways there are to transport everybody to the other side in the minimum number of boat rides. Two ways are considered distinct if during some ride they have distinct sets of people on the boat.Help Greg with this problem.InputThe first line contains two integersn,k(1 ≤n≤ 50, 1 ≤k≤ 5000)— the number of people, including Greg, and the boat's weight limit. The next line containsnintegers — the people's weights. A person's weight is either50kilos or100kilos.You can consider Greg and his friends indexed in some way.OutputIn the first line print an integer — the minimum number of rides. If transporting everyone to the other bank is impossible, print an integer-1.In the second line print the remainder after dividing the number of ways to transport the people in the minimum number of rides by number1000000007(109+ 7). If transporting everyone to the other bank is impossible, print integer0.ExamplesInput1 5050Output11Input3 10050 50 100Output52Input2 5050 50Output-10NoteIn the first test Greg walks alone and consequently, he needs only one ride across the river.In the second test you should follow the plan:transport two50kg. people;transport one50kg. person back;transport one100kg. person;transport one50kg. person back;transport two50kg. people.That totals to5rides. Depending on which person to choose at step 2, we can get two distinct ways.",
