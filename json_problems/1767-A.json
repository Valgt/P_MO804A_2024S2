    "statement": "A. Cut the Triangletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a non-degenerate triangle (a non-degenerate triangle is a triangle with positive area). The vertices of the triangle have coordinates $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$, $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ and $$$(x_3, y_3)$$$.You want to draw a straight line to cut the triangle intotwo non-degenerate triangles. Furthermore, the line you draw should beeither horizontal or vertical.Can you draw the line to meet all the constraints?Here are some suitable ways to draw the line:However, these ways to draw the line are not suitable (the first line cuts the triangle into a triangle and a quadrangle; the second line doesn't cut the triangle at all; the third line is neither horizontal nor vertical):InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of four lines. The first of them is empty. The $$$i$$$-th of the next three lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le 10^8$$$) — the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th vertex of the triangle.Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, the triangle formed by three vertices has positive area (i. e. it is non-degenerate).OutputFor each test case, printYESif it is possible to cut the triangle according to the statement, orNOotherwise. You may print each letter in any case (YES,yes,Yeswill all be recognized as positive answer,NO,noandnOwill all be recognized as negative answer).ExampleInput44 76 83 54 54 76 85 81 82 53 66 66 3OutputYES YES YES NO",
