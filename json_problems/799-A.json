Carrot Cakestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn some game by Playrix it takestminutes for an oven to bakekcarrot cakes, all cakes are ready at the same momenttminutes after they started baking. Arkady needs at leastncakes to complete a task, but he currently don't have any. However, he has infinitely many ingredients and one oven. Moreover, Arkady can build one more similar oven to make the process faster, it would takedminutes to build the oven. While the new oven is being built, only old one can bake cakes, after the new oven is built, both ovens bake simultaneously. Arkady can't build more than one oven.Determine if it is reasonable to build the second oven, i.e. will it decrease the minimum time needed to getncakes or not. If the time needed with the second oven is the same as with one oven, then it is unreasonable.InputThe only line contains four integersn,t,k,d(1 ≤n,t,k,d≤ 1 000) — the number of cakes needed, the time needed for one oven to bakekcakes, the number of cakes baked at the same time, the time needed to build the second oven.OutputIf it is reasonable to build the second oven, print \"YES\". Otherwise print \"NO\".ExamplesInput8 6 4 5OutputYESInput8 6 4 6OutputNOInput10 3 11 4OutputNOInput4 2 1 4OutputYESNoteIn the first example it is possible to get8cakes in12minutes using one oven. The second oven can be built in5minutes, so after6minutes the first oven bakes4cakes, the second oven bakes4more ovens after11minutes. Thus, it is reasonable to build the second oven.In the second example it doesn't matter whether we build the second oven or not, thus it takes12minutes to bake8cakes in both cases. Thus, it is unreasonable to build the second oven.In the third example the first oven bakes11cakes in3minutes, that is more than needed10. It is unreasonable to build the second oven, because its building takes more time that baking the needed number of cakes using the only oven.",
