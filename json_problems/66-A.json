Naturally he is facing the problem of choosing a programming language. After long considerations he realized that Java is the best choice. The main argument in favor of choosing Java was that it has a very large integer data type, called BigInteger.But having attended several classes of the club, Petya realized that not all tasks require using the BigInteger type. It turned out that in some tasks it is much easier to use small data types. That's why a question arises: \"Which integer type to use if one wants to store a positive integern?\"Petya knows only 5 integer types:1)byteoccupies 1 byte and allows you to store numbers from- 128to1272)shortoccupies 2 bytes and allows you to store numbers from- 32768to327673)intoccupies 4 bytes and allows you to store numbers from- 2147483648to21474836474)longoccupies 8 bytes and allows you to store numbers from- 9223372036854775808to92233720368547758075)BigIntegercan store any integer number, but at that it is not a primitive type, and operations with it are much slower.For all the types given above the boundary values are included in the value range.From this list, Petya wants to choose the smallest type that can store a positive integern. Since BigInteger works much slower, Peter regards it last. Help him.InputThe first line contains a positive numbern. It consists of no more than100digits and doesn't contain any leading zeros. The numberncan't be represented as an empty string.Please, do not use%lldspecificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to usecout(also you may use%I64d).OutputPrint the first type from the list \"byte,short,int,long,BigInteger\", that can store the natural numbern, in accordance with the data given above.ExamplesInput127OutputbyteInput130OutputshortInput123456789101112131415161718192021222324OutputBigInteger",
