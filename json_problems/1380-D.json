The power of the $$$i$$$-th warrior is $$$a_i$$$. All powers are pairwise distinct.You have two types of spells which you may cast:Fireball: you spend $$$x$$$ mana and destroyexactly$$$k$$$ consecutive warriors;Berserk: you spend $$$y$$$ mana, choose two consecutive warriors, and the warrior with greater power destroys the warrior with smaller power.For example, let the powers of warriors be $$$[2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 5, 4]$$$, and $$$k = 3$$$. If you cast Berserk on warriors with powers $$$8$$$ and $$$11$$$, the resulting sequence of powers becomes $$$[2, 3, 7, 11, 5, 4]$$$. Then, for example, if you cast Fireball on consecutive warriors with powers $$$[7, 11, 5]$$$, the resulting sequence of powers becomes $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$.You want to turn the current sequence of warriors powers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ into $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_m$$$. Calculate the minimum amount of mana you need to spend on it.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of sequence $$$a$$$ and the length of sequence $$$b$$$ respectively.The second line contains three integers $$$x, k, y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x, y, \\\\le 10^9; 1 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$) — the cost of fireball, the range of fireball and the cost of berserk respectively.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that all integers $$$a_i$$$ are pairwise distinct.The fourth line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that all integers $$$b_i$$$ are pairwise distinct.OutputPrint the minimum amount of mana for turning the sequnce $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ into $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_m$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.ExamplesInput5 2 5 2 3 3 1 4 5 2 3 5Output8Input4 4 5 1 4 4 3 1 2 2 4 3 1Output-1Input4 4 2 1 11 1 3 2 4 1 3 2 4Output0",
