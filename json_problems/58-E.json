He wrote down an expressiona+b=cin his notebook. When the teacher checked Vasya's work it turned out that Vasya had solved the problem incorrectly. Now Vasya tries to find excuses. He says that he simply forgot to write down several digits in numbersa,bandc, but he can't remember what numbers they actually were. Help Vasya, find such numbersx,yandz, with which the following conditions are met:x+y=z,from the expressionx+y=zseveral digits can be erased in such a way that the result will bea+b=c,the expressionx+y=zshould have the minimal length.InputThe first and only input line contains the expressiona+b=c(1 ≤a,b,c≤ 106,a,bandcdon't contain leading zeroes) which is the expression Vasya wrote down.OutputPrint the correct expressionx+y=z(x,yandzare non-negative numbers without leading zeroes). The expressiona+b=cmust be met inx+y=zas a subsequence. The printed solution should have the minimal possible number of characters. If there are several such solutions, you can print any of them.ExamplesInput2+4=5Output21+4=25Input1+1=3Output1+31=32Input1+1=2Output1+1=2",
