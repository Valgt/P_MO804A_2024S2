    "statement": "A. Make it Increasingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers, and an array $$$b$$$, with length $$$n$$$. Initially $$$b_i=0$$$ for each $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$.In one move you can choose an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$), and add $$$a_i$$$ to $$$b_i$$$ or subtract $$$a_i$$$ from $$$b_i$$$. What is the minimum number of moves needed to make $$$b$$$ increasing (that is, every element is strictly greater than every element before it)?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 5000$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers, $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) â€” the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputPrint a single integer, the minimum number of moves to make $$$b$$$ increasing.ExamplesInput5 1 2 3 4 5Output4Input7 1 2 1 2 1 2 1Output10Input8 1 8 2 7 3 6 4 5Output16NoteExample $$$1$$$: you can subtract $$$a_1$$$ from $$$b_1$$$, and add $$$a_3$$$, $$$a_4$$$, and $$$a_5$$$ to $$$b_3$$$, $$$b_4$$$, and $$$b_5$$$ respectively. The final array will be [$$$-1$$$, $$$0$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$] after $$$4$$$ moves.Example $$$2$$$: you can reach [$$$-3$$$, $$$-2$$$, $$$-1$$$, $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$] in $$$10$$$ moves.",
