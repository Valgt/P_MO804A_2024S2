However, sometimes they argue over little things. Recently, they started a new company, but they are having trouble finding a name for the company.To settle this problem, they've decided to play a game. The company name will consist ofnletters. Oleg and Igor each have a set ofnletters (which might contain multiple copies of the same letter, the sets can be different). Initially, the company name is denoted bynquestion marks. Oleg and Igor takes turns to play the game, Oleg moves first. In each turn, a player can choose one of the letterscin his set and replace any of the question marks withc. Then, a copy of the lettercis removed from his set. The game ends when all the question marks has been replaced by some letter.For example, suppose Oleg has the set of letters{i,o,i}and Igor has the set of letters{i,m,o}. One possible game is as follows :Initially, the company name is???.Oleg replaces the second question mark with'i'. The company name becomes?i?. The set of letters Oleg have now is{i,o}.Igor replaces the third question mark with'o'. The company name becomes?io. The set of letters Igor have now is{i,m}.Finally, Oleg replaces the first question mark with'o'. The company name becomesoio. The set of letters Oleg have now is{i}.In the end, the company name isoio.Oleg wants the company name to be as lexicographically small as possible while Igor wants the company name to be as lexicographically large as possible. What will be the company name if Oleg and Igor always play optimally?A strings=s1s2...smis called lexicographically smaller than a stringt=t1t2...tm(wheres≠t) ifsi<tiwhereiis the smallest index such thatsi≠ti.
