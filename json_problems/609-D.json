    "statement": "D. Gadgets for dollars and poundstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNura wants to buykgadgets. She has onlysburles for that. She can buy each gadget for dollars or for pounds. So each gadget is selling only for some type of currency. The type of currency and the cost in that currency are not changing.Nura can buy gadgets forndays. For each day you know the exchange rates of dollar and pound, so you know the cost of conversion burles to dollars or to pounds.Each day (from1ton) Nura can buy some gadgets by current exchange rate. Each day she can buy any gadgets she wants, but each gadget can be bought no more than once duringndays.Help Nura to find the minimum day index when she will havekgadgets. Nura always pays with burles, which are converted according to the exchange rate of the purchase day. Nura can't buy dollars or pounds, she always stores only burles. Gadgets are numbered with integers from1tomin order of their appearing in input.InputFirst line contains four integersn,m,k,s(1 ≤n≤ 2·105, 1 ≤k≤m≤ 2·105, 1 ≤s≤ 109) — number of days, total number and required number of gadgets, number of burles Nura has.Second line containsnintegersai(1 ≤ai≤ 106) — the cost of one dollar in burles oni-th day.Third line containsnintegersbi(1 ≤bi≤ 106) — the cost of one pound in burles oni-th day.Each of the nextmlines contains two integersti,ci(1 ≤ti≤ 2, 1 ≤ci≤ 106) — type of the gadget and it's cost. For the gadgets of the first type cost is specified in dollars. For the gadgets of the second type cost is specified in pounds.OutputIf Nura can't buykgadgets print the only line with the number-1.Otherwise the first line should contain integerd— the minimum day index, when Nura will havekgadgets. On each of the nextklines print two integersqi,di— the number of gadget and the day gadget should be bought. All valuesqishould be different, but the valuesdican coincide (so Nura can buy several gadgets at one day). The days are numbered from1ton.In case there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput5 4 2 21 2 3 2 13 2 1 2 31 12 11 22 2Output31 12 3Input4 3 2 20069 70 71 72104 105 106 1071 12 21 2Output-1Input4 3 1 1000000000900000 910000 940000 990000990000 999000 999900 9999901 876542 765431 65432Output-1",
