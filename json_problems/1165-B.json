Polycarp Trainingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp wants to train before another programming competition. During the first day of his training he should solve exactly $$$1$$$ problem, during the second day — exactly $$$2$$$ problems, during the third day — exactly $$$3$$$ problems, and so on. During the $$$k$$$-th day he should solve $$$k$$$ problems.Polycarp has a list of $$$n$$$ contests, the $$$i$$$-th contest consists of $$$a_i$$$ problems. During each day Polycarp has to chooseexactly oneof the contests he didn't solve yet and solve it. He solvesexactly $$$k$$$ problems from this contest. Other problems are discarded from it. If there are no contests consisting of at least $$$k$$$ problems that Polycarp didn't solve yet during the $$$k$$$-th day, then Polycarp stops his training.How many days Polycarp can train if he chooses the contests optimally?InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of contests.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of problems in the $$$i$$$-th contest.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum number of days Polycarp can train if he chooses the contests optimally.ExamplesInput4 3 1 4 1Output3Input3 1 1 1Output1Input5 1 1 1 2 2Output2",
