She wants to impress judges and show her mathematical skills.Her problem is following: for given string, consisting of only 0 and 1, tell if it's possible to remove some digits in such a way, that remaining number is a representation of some positive integer, divisible by 64, in the binary numerical system.InputIn the only line given a non-empty binary stringswith length up to100.OutputPrint «yes» (without quotes) if it's possible to remove digits required way and «no» otherwise.ExamplesInput100010001OutputyesInput100OutputnoNoteIn the first test case, you can get string1 000 000after removing two ones which is a representation of number64in the binary numerical system.You can read more about binary numeral system representation here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_system",
