He came to the potion store where he can buy any potion. Each potion is characterized by two integers — amount of experience and cost. The efficiency of a potion is the ratio of the amount of experience to the cost. Efficiency may be a non-integer number.For each two integer numbersaandbsuch thatl≤a≤randx≤b≤ythere is a potion with experienceaand costbin the store (that is, there are(r-l+ 1)·(y-x+ 1)potions).Kirill wants to buy a potion which has efficiencyk. Will he be able to do this?InputFirst string contains five integer numbersl,r,x,y,k(1 ≤l≤r≤ 107,1 ≤x≤y≤ 107,1 ≤k≤ 107).OutputPrint \"YES\" without quotes if a potion with efficiency exactlykcan be bought in the store and \"NO\" without quotes otherwise.You can output each of the letters in any register.ExamplesInput1 10 1 10 1OutputYESInput1 5 6 10 1OutputNO",
