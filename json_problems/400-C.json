They brought a really huge candy matrix, it's big even for Sereja! Let's number the rows of the giant matrix from1tonfrom top to bottom and the columns — from1tom, from left to right. We'll represent the cell on the intersection of thei-th row andj-th column as(i,j). Just as is expected, some cells of the giant candy matrix contain candies. Overall the matrix haspcandies: thek-th candy is at cell(xk,yk).The time moved closer to dinner and Inna was already going to eatpof her favourite sweets from the matrix, when suddenly Sereja (for the reason he didn't share with anyone) rotated the matrixxtimes clockwise by 90 degrees. Then he performed the horizontal rotate of the matrixytimes. And then he rotated the matrixztimes counterclockwise by 90 degrees. The figure below shows how the rotates of the matrix looks like.Inna got really upset, but Duma suddenly understood two things: the candies didn't get damaged and he remembered which cells contained Inna's favourite sweets before Sereja's strange actions. Help guys to find the new coordinates in the candy matrix after the transformation Sereja made!InputThe first line of the input contains fix integersn,m,x,y,z,p(1 ≤n,m≤ 109; 0 ≤x,y,z≤ 109; 1 ≤p≤ 105).Each of the followingplines contains two integersxk,yk(1 ≤xk≤n; 1 ≤yk≤m)— the initial coordinates of thek-th candy. Two candies can lie on the same cell.OutputFor each of thepcandies, print on a single line its space-separated new coordinates.ExamplesInput3 3 3 1 1 91 11 21 32 12 22 33 13 23 3Output1 31 21 12 32 22 13 33 23 1NoteJust for clarity. Horizontal rotating is like a mirroring of the matrix. For matrix:QWER      REWQASDF  ->  FDSAZXCV      VCXZ",
