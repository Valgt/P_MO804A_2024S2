Keyboard Designtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp has a dictionary of $$$n$$$ words, consisting of $$$12$$$ first letters of the Latin alphabet. The words are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. In every pair of adjacent characters in each word, the characters are different. For every word $$$i$$$, Monocarp also has an integer $$$c_i$$$ denoting how often he uses this word.Monocarp wants to design a keyboard that would allow him to type some of the words easily. A keyboard can be denoted as a sequence of $$$12$$$ first letters of the Latin alphabet, where each letter fromatolappears exactly once.A word can be typed with the keyboard easily if, for every pair of adjacent characters in the word, these characters are adjacent in the keyboard as well. Theoptimalityof the keyboard is the sum of $$$c_i$$$ over all words $$$i$$$ that can be typed easily with it.Help Monocarp to design a keyboard with the maximum possible optimality.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of words.Then, $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains an integer $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le 10^5$$$) and a string $$$s_i$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le |s_i| \\\\le 2000$$$) denoting the $$$i$$$-th word. Each character of $$$s_i$$$ is one of $$$12$$$ first letters of Latin alphabet, in lowercase. For every $$$j \\\\in [1, |s_i| - 1]$$$, the $$$j$$$-th character of $$$s_i$$$ is different from the $$$(j+1)$$$-th one.Additional constraint on the input: $$$\\\\sum \\\\limits_{i=1}^{n} |s_i| \\\\le 2000$$$.OutputPrint a sequence of $$$12$$$ first letters of the Latin alphabet, where each letter fromatolappears exactly once, denoting the optimal keyboard. If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.ExamplesInput3 7 abacaba 10 cba 4 dbOutputhjkildbacefgInput1 100 abcaOutputabcdefghijkl",
