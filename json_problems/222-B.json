Cosmic Tablestime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe Free Meteor Association (FMA) has got a problem: as meteors are moving, the Universal Cosmic Descriptive Humorous Program (UCDHP) needs to add a special module that would analyze this movement.UCDHP stores some secret information about meteors as ann×mtable with integers in its cells. The order of meteors in the Universe is changing. That's why the main UCDHP module receives the following queries:The query to swap two table rows;The query to swap two table columns;The query to obtain a secret number in a particular table cell.As the main UCDHP module is critical, writing the functional of working with the table has been commissioned to you.InputThe first line contains three space-separated integersn,mandk(1 ≤n,m≤ 1000,1 ≤k≤ 500000) — the number of table columns and rows and the number of queries, correspondingly.Nextnlines containmspace-separated numbers each — the initial state of the table. Each numberpin the table is an integer and satisfies the inequality0 ≤p≤ 106.Nextklines contain queries in the format \"sixiyi\", wheresiis one of the characters \"с\", \"r\" or \"g\", andxi,yiare two integers.Ifsi= \"c\", then the current query is the query to swap columns with indexesxiandyi(1 ≤x,y≤m,x≠y);Ifsi= \"r\", then the current query is the query to swap rows with indexesxiandyi(1 ≤x,y≤n,x≠y);Ifsi= \"g\", then the current query is the query to obtain the number that located in thexi-th row and in theyi-th column (1 ≤x≤n, 1 ≤y≤m).The table rows are considered to be indexed from top to bottom from 1 ton, and the table columns — from left to right from 1 tom.OutputFor each query to obtain a number (si= \"g\") print the required number. Print the answers to the queries in the order of the queries in the input.ExamplesInput3 3 51 2 34 5 67 8 9g 3 2r 3 2c 2 3g 2 2g 3 2Output896Input2 3 31 2 43 1 5c 2 1r 1 2g 1 3Output5NoteLet's see how the table changes in the second test case.After the first operation is fulfilled, the table looks like that:2 1 41 3 5After the second operation is fulfilled, the table looks like that:1 3 52 1 4So the answer to the third query (the number located in the first row and in the third column) will be 5.",
