Is it possible to reorder it in such way so that the sum of the first $$$n$$$ elementsisn'tequal to the sum of the last $$$n$$$ elements?InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$), where $$$2n$$$ is the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$2n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\\\\ldots$$$, $$$a_{2n}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputIf there's no solution, print \"-1\" (without quotes). Otherwise, print a single line containing $$$2n$$$ space-separated integers. They must form a reordering of $$$a$$$. You are allowed to not change the order.ExamplesInput3 1 2 2 1 3 1Output2 1 3 1 1 2Input1 1 1Output-1NoteIn the first example, the first $$$n$$$ elements have sum $$$2+1+3=6$$$ while the last $$$n$$$ elements have sum $$$1+1+2=4$$$. The sums aren't equal.In the second example, there's no solution.",
