Correcting Mistakestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAnalyzing the mistakes people make while typing search queries is a complex and an interesting work. As there is no guaranteed way to determine what the user originally meant by typing some query, we have to use different sorts of heuristics.Polycarp needed to write a code that could, given two words, check whether they could have been obtained from the same word as a result of typos. Polycarpus suggested that the most common typo is skipping exactly one letter as you type a word.Implement a program that can, given two distinct wordsSandTof the same lengthndetermine how many wordsWof lengthn+ 1are there with such property that you can transformWinto bothS, andTby deleting exactly one character.
