Peter wants all numbers in the sequence to equalh. He can perform the operation of \"adding one on the segment[l,r]\": add one to all elements of the sequence with indices fromltor(inclusive). At that, Peter never chooses any element as the beginning of the segment twice. Similarly, Peter never chooses any element as the end of the segment twice. In other words, for any two segments[l1,r1]and[l2,r2], where Peter added one, the following inequalities hold:l1≠l2andr1≠r2.How many distinct ways are there to make all numbers in the sequence equalh? Print this number of ways modulo1000000007 (109+ 7). Two ways are considered distinct if one of them has a segment that isn't in the other way.InputThe first line contains two integersn,h(1 ≤n,h≤ 2000).
