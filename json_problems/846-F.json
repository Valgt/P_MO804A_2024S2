You pick two integer numberslandrfrom1ton, inclusive (numbers are picked randomly, equiprobably and independently). Ifl>r, then you swap values oflandr. You have to calculate the expected value of the number of unique elements in segment of the array from indexlto indexr, inclusive (1-indexed).InputThe first line contains one integer numbern(1 ≤n≤ 106). The second line containsninteger numbersa1,a2, ...an(1 ≤ai≤ 106)— elements of the array.OutputPrint one number — the expected number of unique elements in chosen segment.Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed10- 4— formally, the answer is correct if, wherexis jury's answer, andyis your answer.ExamplesInput21 2Output1.500000Input22 2Output1.000000",
