The table hasnpiles of coins lying on it, thei-th pile hasaicoins. Furlo and Rublo move in turns, Furlo moves first. In one move you are allowed to:choose some pile, let's denote the current number of coins in it asx;choose some integery(0 ≤y<x;x1 / 4≤y≤x1 / 2)and decrease the number of coins in this pile toy. In other words, after the described move the pile will haveycoins left.The player who can't make a move, loses.Your task is to find out, who wins in the given game if both Furlo and Rublo play optimally well.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 77777)— the number of piles. The next line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 777777777777)— the sizes of piles. The numbers are separated by single spaces.Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.OutputIf both players play optimally well and Furlo wins, print \"Furlo\", otherwise print \"Rublo\". Print the answers without the quotes.ExamplesInput11OutputRubloInput21 2OutputRubloInput101 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10OutputFurlo",
