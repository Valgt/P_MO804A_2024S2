The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.The picture corresponds to the third example.Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.InputThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le w, h \\\\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\\\right\\\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.OutputPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.ExamplesInput3 3 1Output8Input7 9 1Output28Input7 9 2Output40NoteThe first example is shown on the picture below.The second example is shown on the picture below.The third example is shown in the problem description.",
