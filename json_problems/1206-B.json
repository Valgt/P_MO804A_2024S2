Make Product Equal Onetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$. With a cost of one coin you can perform the following operation:Choose one of these numbers and add or subtract $$$1$$$ from it.In particular, we can apply this operation to the same number several times.We want to make the product of all these numbers equal to $$$1$$$, in other words, we want $$$a_1 \\\\cdot a_2$$$ $$$\\\\dots$$$ $$$\\\\cdot a_n = 1$$$.For example, for $$$n = 3$$$ and numbers $$$[1, -3, 0]$$$ we can make product equal to $$$1$$$ in $$$3$$$ coins: add $$$1$$$ to second element, add $$$1$$$ to second element again, subtract $$$1$$$ from third element, so that array becomes $$$[1, -1, -1]$$$. And $$$1\\\\cdot (-1) \\\\cdot (-1) = 1$$$.What is the minimum cost we will have to pay to do that?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of numbers.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the numbers.OutputOutput a single number — the minimal number of coins you need to pay to make the product equal to $$$1$$$.ExamplesInput2 -1 1Output2Input4 0 0 0 0Output4Input5 -5 -3 5 3 0Output13NoteIn the first example, you can change $$$1$$$ to $$$-1$$$ or $$$-1$$$ to $$$1$$$ in $$$2$$$ coins.In the second example, you have to apply at least $$$4$$$ operations for the product not to be $$$0$$$.In the third example, you can change $$$-5$$$ to $$$-1$$$ in $$$4$$$ coins, $$$-3$$$ to $$$-1$$$ in $$$2$$$ coins, $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$ in $$$4$$$ coins, $$$3$$$ to $$$1$$$ in $$$2$$$ coins, $$$0$$$ to $$$1$$$ in $$$1$$$ coin.",
