This operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in languageC++andJavait is represented as \"^\" and inPascal— as \"xor\".Help him find among all permutations of integers from0tonthe permutation with the maximum beauty.InputThe single line contains a positive integern(1 ≤n≤ 106).OutputIn the first line print integermthe maximum possible beauty.
