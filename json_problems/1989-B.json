Substring and Subsequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both consisting of lowercase Latin letters.Asubsequenceof a string is a string which can be obtained by removing several (possibly zero) characters from the original string. Asubstringof a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.For example, consider the stringabac:a,b,c,ab,aa,ac,ba,bc,aba,abc,aac,bacandabacare its subsequences;a,b,c,ab,ba,ac,aba,bacandabacare its substrings.Your task is to calculate the minimum possible length of the string that contains $$$a$$$ as a substring and $$$b$$$ as a subsequence.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a string $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |a| \\\\le 100$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |b| \\\\le 100$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible length of the string that contains $$$a$$$ as a substring and $$$b$$$ as a subsequence.ExampleInput5abacbercfmmmmmmcontesttestcdeabcefgOutput4 4 3 7 7NoteIn the examples below, the characters that correspond to the subsequence equal to $$$b$$$ are bolded.In the first example, one of the possible answers iscaba.In the second example, one of the possible answers isercf.In the third example, one of the possible answers ismmm.In the fourth example, one of the possible answers iscontest.In the fifth example, one of the possible answers isabcdefg.",
