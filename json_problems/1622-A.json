    "statement": "A. Construct a Rectangletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are three sticks with integer lengths $$$l_1, l_2$$$ and $$$l_3$$$.You are asked to break exactly one of them into two pieces in such a way that:both pieces have positive (strictly greater than $$$0$$$)integerlength;the total length of the pieces is equal to the original length of the stick;it's possible to construct a rectangle from the resulting four sticks such that each stick is used as exactly one of its sides.A square is also considered a rectangle.Determine if it's possible to do that.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The only line of each testcase contains three integers $$$l_1, l_2, l_3$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le 10^8$$$) — the lengths of the sticks.OutputFor each testcase, print \"YES\" if it's possible to break one of the sticks into two pieces with positive integer length in such a way that it's possible to construct a rectangle from the resulting four sticks. Otherwise, print \"NO\".You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESare all recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput4 6 1 5 2 5 2 2 4 2 5 5 4OutputYES NO YES YESNoteIn the first testcase, the first stick can be broken into parts of length $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$. We can construct a rectangle with opposite sides of length $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$.In the second testcase, breaking the stick of length $$$2$$$ can only result in sticks of lengths $$$1, 1, 2, 5$$$, which can't be made into a rectangle. Breaking the stick of length $$$5$$$ can produce results $$$2, 3$$$ or $$$1, 4$$$ but neither of them can't be put into a rectangle.In the third testcase, the second stick can be broken into parts of length $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$. The resulting rectangle has opposite sides $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ (which is a square).In the fourth testcase, the third stick can be broken into parts of length $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$. The resulting rectangle has opposite sides $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$.",
