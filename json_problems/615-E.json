He decided to start his search from an infinite field tiled by hexagons. For convenience the coordinate system is introduced, take a look at the picture to see how the coordinates of hexagon are defined:Ayrat is searching through the field. He started at point(0, 0)and is moving along the spiral (see second picture). Sometimes he forgets where he is now.
