XOR Inversetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers. You have to choose a non-negative integer $$$x$$$ and form a new array $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$ according to the following rule: for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, $$$b_i = a_i \\\\oplus x$$$ ($$$\\\\oplus$$$ denotes the operationbitwise XOR).An inversion in the $$$b$$$ array is a pair of integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n$$$ and $$$b_i > b_j$$$.You should choose $$$x$$$ in such a way that the number of inversions in $$$b$$$ is minimized. If there are several options for $$$x$$$ — output the smallest one.InputFirst line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$.Second line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.OutputOutput two integers: the minimum possible number of inversions in $$$b$$$, and the minimum possible value of $$$x$$$, which achieves those number of inversions.ExamplesInput4 0 1 3 2Output1 0Input9 10 7 9 10 7 5 5 3 5Output4 14Input3 8 10 3Output0 8NoteIn the first sample it is optimal to leave the array as it is by choosing $$$x = 0$$$.In the second sample the selection of $$$x = 14$$$ results in $$$b$$$: $$$[4, 9, 7, 4, 9, 11, 11, 13, 11]$$$. It has $$$4$$$ inversions:$$$i = 2$$$, $$$j = 3$$$;$$$i = 2$$$, $$$j = 4$$$;$$$i = 3$$$, $$$j = 4$$$;$$$i = 8$$$, $$$j = 9$$$.In the third sample the selection of $$$x = 8$$$ results in $$$b$$$: $$$[0, 2, 11]$$$. It has no inversions.",
