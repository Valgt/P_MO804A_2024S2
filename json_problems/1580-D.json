Subsequencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice has an integer sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ andall elements are different. She will choose a subsequence of $$$a$$$ of length $$$m$$$, and defines the value of a subsequence $$$a_{b_1},a_{b_2},\\\\ldots,a_{b_m}$$$ as $$$$$$\\\\sum_{i = 1}^m (m \\\\cdot a_{b_i}) - \\\\sum_{i = 1}^m \\\\sum_{j = 1}^m f(\\\\min(b_i, b_j), \\\\max(b_i, b_j)),$$$$$$ where $$$f(i, j)$$$ denotes $$$\\\\min(a_i, a_{i + 1}, \\\\ldots, a_j)$$$.Alice wants you to help her to maximize the value of the subsequence she choose.A sequence $$$s$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$t$$$ if $$$s$$$ can be obtained from $$$t$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le n \\\\le 4000$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i < 2^{31}$$$).OutputPrint the maximal value Alice can get.ExamplesInput6 4 15 2 18 12 13 4Output100Input11 5 9 3 7 1 8 12 10 20 15 18 5Output176Input1 1 114514Output0Input2 1 666 888Output0NoteIn the first example, Alice can choose the subsequence $$$[15, 2, 18, 13]$$$, which has the value $$$4 \\\\cdot (15 + 2 + 18 + 13) - (15 + 2 + 2 + 2) - (2 + 2 + 2 + 2) - (2 + 2 + 18 + 12) - (2 + 2 + 12 + 13) = 100$$$. In the second example, there are a variety of subsequences with value $$$176$$$, and one of them is $$$[9, 7, 12, 20, 18]$$$.",
