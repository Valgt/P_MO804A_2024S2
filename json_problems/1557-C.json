They create an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers where every element is less than $$$2^k$$$.Moamen wins if $$$a_1 \\\\,\\\\&\\\\, a_2 \\\\,\\\\&\\\\, a_3 \\\\,\\\\&\\\\, \\\\ldots \\\\,\\\\&\\\\, a_n \\\\ge a_1 \\\\oplus a_2 \\\\oplus a_3 \\\\oplus \\\\ldots \\\\oplus a_n$$$.Here $$$\\\\&$$$ denotes thebitwise AND operation, and $$$\\\\oplus$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operation.Please calculate the number of winning for Moamen arrays $$$a$$$.As the result may be very large, print the value modulo $$$1\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,007$$$ ($$$10^9 + 7$$$).InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 5$$$)— the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n\\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print a single value — the number of different arrays that Moamen wins with.Print the result modulo $$$1\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,007$$$ ($$$10^9 + 7$$$).ExampleInput3 3 1 2 1 4 0Output5 2 1NoteIn the first example, $$$n = 3$$$, $$$k = 1$$$. As a result, all the possible arrays are $$$[0,0,0]$$$, $$$[0,0,1]$$$, $$$[0,1,0]$$$, $$$[1,0,0]$$$, $$$[1,1,0]$$$, $$$[0,1,1]$$$, $$$[1,0,1]$$$, and $$$[1,1,1]$$$.Moamen wins in only $$$5$$$ of them: $$$[0,0,0]$$$, $$$[1,1,0]$$$, $$$[0,1,1]$$$, $$$[1,0,1]$$$, and $$$[1,1,1]$$$.",
