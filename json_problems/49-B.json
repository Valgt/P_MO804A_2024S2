Unfortunately, he often forgets to write the base of notation in which the expression is written. Once he saw a note in his notebook sayinga+b= ?, and that the base of the positional notation wasn’t written anywhere. Now Vasya has to choose a basepand regard the expression as written in the baseppositional notation. Vasya understood that he can get different results with different bases, and some bases are even invalid. For example, expression78 + 87in the base 16 positional notation is equal toFF16, in the base 15 positional notation it is equal to11015, in the base 10 one — to16510, in the base 9 one — to1769, and in the base 8 or lesser-based positional notations the expression is invalid as all the numbers should be strictly less than the positional notation base. Vasya got interested in what is the length of the longest possible expression value. Help him to find this length.The length of a number should be understood as the number of numeric characters in it. For example, the length of the longest answer for78 + 87 = ?is 3. It is calculated like that in the base 15 (11015), base 10 (16510), base 9 (1769) positional notations, for example, and in some other ones.InputThe first letter contains two space-separated numbersaandb(1 ≤a,b≤ 1000) which represent the given summands.OutputPrint a single number — the length of the longest answer.ExamplesInput78 87Output3Input1 1Output2",
