Today they play a game with strings with the following rules. Firstly Toastman tells Appleman two stringssandtboth consisting only of letters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'. Then Appleman must build stringsas quickly as possible. Initially he has empty string, and in one second he can append to end of the current string any contiguous substring oft.Now, Toastman and Appleman are beginning to play the game. Toastman has already told stringtto Appleman, but he hasn't come up with stringsyet. Toastman only thinks, that he should choose stringsconsisting ofncharacters. Of course, he wants to find the worst string for Appleman (such string, that Appleman will spend as much time as possible during the game). Tell Toastman, how much time will Appleman spend during the game if Toastman finds the worst string for him. You can assume that Appleman plays optimally, therefore he builds any stringsin minimal possible time.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 1018). The second line contains stringt(1 ≤ |t| ≤ 105). Stringtconsists of only letters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'. Each letter appears at least once in stringt.OutputPrint a single integer — the largest possible time Appleman needs.ExamplesInput5ABCCADOutput5Input5AAABACADBABBBCBDCACBCCCDDDBDCDDOutput4NoteIn the first example, Toastman can choosesequal to \"AAAAA\".In the second example, Toastman can choosesequal to \"DADDA\".",
