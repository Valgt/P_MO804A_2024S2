Distinguish plus state and minus statetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a qubit which is guaranteed to be either inor instate.Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 1 if it was astate or -1 if it wasstate. The state of the qubit after the operations does not matter.InputYou have to implement an operation which takes a qubit as an input and returns an integer.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;operation Solve (q : Qubit) : Int{body{// your code here}}}",
