Recently her class studied right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. It appeared, that there are triples of positive integers such that you can construct a right triangle with segments of lengths corresponding to triple. Such triples are calledPythagorean triples.For example, triples(3, 4, 5),(5, 12, 13)and(6, 8, 10)are Pythagorean triples.Here Katya wondered if she can specify the length of some side of right triangle and find any Pythagorean triple corresponding to such length? Note that the side which length is specified can be a cathetus as well as hypotenuse.Katya had no problems with completing this task. Will you do the same?InputThe only line of the input contains single integern(1 ≤n≤ 109) — the length of some side of a right triangle.OutputPrint two integersmandk(1 ≤m,k≤ 1018), such thatn,mandkform a Pythagorean triple, in the only line.In case if there is no any Pythagorean triple containing integern, print- 1in the only line. If there are many answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput3Output4 5Input6Output8 10Input1Output-1Input17Output144 145Input67Output2244 2245NoteIllustration for the first sample.",
