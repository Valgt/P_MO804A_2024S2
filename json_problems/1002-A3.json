Generate superposition of two basis statestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are givenNqubits (1 ≤N≤ 8) in zero state. You are also given two bitstringsbits0andbits1which describe two different basis states onNqubitsand.Your task is to generate a state which is an equal superposition of the given basis states:You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:an array of qubitsqs,two arrays of Boolean valuesbits0andbits1representing the basis statesand. These arrays will have the same length as the array of qubits.bits0andbits1will differ in at least one position.The operation doesn't have an output; its \"output\" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;operation Solve (qs : Qubit[], bits0 : Bool[], bits1 : Bool[]) : (){body{// your code here}}}",
