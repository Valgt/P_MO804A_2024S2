Leaf Setstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an undirected tree, consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices.The vertex is called a leaf if it has exactly one vertex adjacent to it.The distance between some pair of vertices is the number of edges in the shortest path between them.Let's call some set of leavesbeautifulif the maximum distance between any pair of leaves in it is less or equal to $$$k$$$.You want to splitallleaves intonon-intersectingbeautiful sets. What is the minimal number of sets in such a split?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the maximum distance between any pair of leaves in each beautiful set.Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$v_i$$$ and $$$u_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v_i, u_i \\\\le n$$$) — the description of the $$$i$$$-th edge.It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimal number of beautiful sets the split can have.ExamplesInput9 31 21 32 42 53 66 76 83 9Output2Input5 31 22 33 44 5Output2Input6 11 21 31 41 51 6Output5NoteHere is the graph for the first example:",
