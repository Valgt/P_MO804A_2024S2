Comfortably Numbtime limit per test8 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers.Thenumbnessof a subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\\\ldots, a_r$$$ (for arbitrary $$$l \\\\leq r$$$) is defined as $$$$$$\\\\max(a_l, a_{l+1}, \\\\ldots, a_r) \\\\oplus (a_l \\\\oplus a_{l+1} \\\\oplus \\\\ldots \\\\oplus a_r),$$$$$$ where $$$\\\\oplus$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operation.Find the maximum numbness over all subarrays.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print one integer â€” the maximum numbness over all subarrays of the given array.ExampleInput251 2 3 4 5310 47 52Output7 47NoteFor the first test case, for the subarray $$$[3, 4, 5]$$$, its maximum value is $$$5$$$. Hence, its numbness is $$$3 \\\\oplus 4 \\\\oplus 5 \\\\oplus 5$$$ = $$$7$$$. This is the maximum possible numbness in this array.In the second test case the subarray $$$[47, 52]$$$ provides the maximum numbness.",
