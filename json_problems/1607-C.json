Minimum Extractiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYelisey has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers.If $$$a$$$ has length strictly greater than $$$1$$$, then Yelisei can apply an operation calledminimum extractionto it:First, Yelisei finds the minimal number $$$m$$$ in the array. If there are several identical minima, Yelisey can choose any of them.Then the selected minimal element is removed from the array. After that, $$$m$$$ is subtracted from each remaining element.Thus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by $$$1$$$.For example, if $$$a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4]$$$, then the minimum element in it is $$$a_3 = -4$$$, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to $$$a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]$$$.Since Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array $$$a$$$ to be as big as possible.Formally speaking, he wants to make theminimumof the numbers in array $$$a$$$ to bemaximal possible(i.e. he want to maximize a minimum). To do this, Yelisey can apply theminimum extractionoperation to the array as many times as he wants (possibly, zero). Note that the operation cannot be applied to an array of length $$$1$$$.Help him find what maximal value can the minimal element of the array have after applying several (possibly, zero)minimum extractionoperations to the array.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The next $$$2t$$$ lines contain descriptions of the test cases.In the description of each test case, the first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the original length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of the description lists $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines, each of them containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is a single integer — the maximal possible minimum in $$$a$$$, which can be obtained by several applications of the described operation to it.ExampleInput8 1 10 2 0 0 3 -1 2 0 4 2 10 1 7 2 2 3 5 3 2 -4 -2 0 2 -1 1 1 -2Output10 0 2 5 2 2 2 -2NoteIn the first example test case, the original length of the array $$$n = 1$$$. Thereforeminimum extractioncannot be applied to it. Thus, the array remains unchanged and the answer is $$$a_1 = 10$$$.In the second set of input data, the array will always consist only of zeros.In the third set, the array will be changing as follows: $$$[\\\\color{blue}{-1}, 2, 0] \\\\to [3, \\\\color{blue}{1}] \\\\to [\\\\color{blue}{2}]$$$. The minimum elements are highlighted with $$$\\\\color{blue}{\\\\text{blue}}$$$. The maximal one is $$$2$$$.In the fourth set, the array will be modified as $$$[2, 10, \\\\color{blue}{1}, 7] \\\\to [\\\\color{blue}{1}, 9, 6] \\\\to [8, \\\\color{blue}{5}] \\\\to [\\\\color{blue}{3}]$$$. Similarly, the maximum of the minimum elements is $$$5$$$.",
