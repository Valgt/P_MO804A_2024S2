You know the areas of its three faces that have a common vertex. Your task is to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of this parallelepiped.InputThe first and the single line contains three space-separated integers — the areas of the parallelepiped's faces. The area's values are positive( > 0)and do not exceed104. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one parallelepiped that satisfies the problem statement.OutputPrint a single number — the sum of all edges of the parallelepiped.ExamplesInput1 1 1Output12Input4 6 6Output28NoteIn the first sample the parallelepiped has sizes1 × 1 × 1, in the second one —2 × 2 × 3.",
