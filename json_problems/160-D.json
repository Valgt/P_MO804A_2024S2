Edges in MSTtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYou are given a connected weighted undirected graph without any loops and multiple edges.Let us remind you that a graph'sspanning treeis defined as an acyclic connected subgraph of the given graph that includes all of the graph's vertexes. Theweightof a tree is defined as the sum of weights of the edges that the given tree contains. Theminimum spanning tree(MST) of a graph is defined as the graph's spanning tree having the minimum possible weight. For any connected graph obviously exists the minimum spanning tree, but in the general case, a graph's minimum spanning tree is not unique.Your task is to determine the following for each edge of the given graph: whether it is either included inanyMST, or includedat least in oneMST, ornot included in anyMST.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(2 ≤n≤ 105,) — the number of the graph's vertexes and edges, correspondingly. Then followmlines, each of them contains three integers — the description of the graph's edges as \"aibiwi\" (1 ≤ai,bi≤n, 1 ≤wi≤ 106,ai≠bi), whereaiandbiare the numbers of vertexes connected by thei-th edge,wiis the edge's weight. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and doesn't contain loops or multiple edges.OutputPrintmlines — the answers for all edges. If thei-th edge is included in any MST, print \"any\"; if thei-th edge is included at least in one MST, print \"at least one\"; if thei-th edge isn't included in any MST, print \"none\". Print the answers for the edges in the order in which the edges are specified in the input.ExamplesInput4 51 2 1011 3 1002 3 22 4 23 4 1Outputnoneanyat least oneat least oneanyInput3 31 2 12 3 11 3 2OutputanyanynoneInput3 31 2 12 3 11 3 1Outputat least oneat least oneat least oneNoteIn the second sample the MST is unique for the given graph: it contains two first edges.In the third sample any two edges form the MST for the given graph. That means that each edge is included at least in one MST.",
