Nastia and a Good Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNastia has received an array of $$$n$$$ positive integers as a gift.She calls such an array $$$a$$$ good that for all $$$i$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$) takes place $$$gcd(a_{i - 1}, a_{i}) = 1$$$, where $$$gcd(u, v)$$$ denotes thegreatest common divisor (GCD)of integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.You can perform the operation: select twodifferentindices $$$i, j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i, j \\\\le n$$$, $$$i \\\\neq j$$$) and two integers $$$x, y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x, y \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^9$$$) so that $$$\\\\min{(a_i, a_j)} = \\\\min{(x, y)}$$$. Then change $$$a_i$$$ to $$$x$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ to $$$y$$$.The girl asks you to make the array good usingat most$$$n$$$ operations.It can be proven that this is always possible.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the array which Nastia has received as a gift.It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ in one test doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each of $$$t$$$ test cases print a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$) — the number of operations. You don't need to minimize this number.In each of the next $$$k$$$ lines print $$$4$$$ integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\neq j \\\\le n$$$, $$$1 \\\\le x, y \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^9$$$) so that $$$\\\\min{(a_i, a_j)} = \\\\min{(x, y)}$$$ — in this manner you replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$x$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ with $$$y$$$.If there are multiple answers, print any.ExampleInput2 5 9 6 3 11 15 3 7 5 13Output2 1 5 11 9 2 5 7 6 0NoteConsider the first test case.Initially $$$a = [9, 6, 3, 11, 15]$$$.In the first operation replace $$$a_1$$$ with $$$11$$$ and $$$a_5$$$ with $$$9$$$. It's valid, because $$$\\\\min{(a_1, a_5)} = \\\\min{(11, 9)} = 9$$$.After this $$$a = [11, 6, 3, 11, 9]$$$.In the second operation replace $$$a_2$$$ with $$$7$$$ and $$$a_5$$$ with $$$6$$$. It's valid, because $$$\\\\min{(a_2, a_5)} = \\\\min{(7, 6)} = 6$$$.After this $$$a = [11, 7, 3, 11, 6]$$$ — a good array.In the second test case, the initial array is already good.",
