Your task is to restore the initial tetragon.InputThe first input line contains one numberT— amount of tests (1 ≤T≤ 5·104). Each of the followingTlines contains numbersx1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3— coordinates of different points that are the centers of three equal sides (non-negative integer numbers, not exceeding 10).OutputFor each test output two lines. If the required tetragon exists, output in the first lineYES, in the second line — four pairs of numbers — coordinates of the polygon's vertices in clockwise or counter-clockwise order. Don't forget, please, that the tetragon should be strictly convex, i.e. no 3 of its points lie on one line. Output numbers with 9 characters after a decimal point.If the required tetragon doen't exist, outputNOin the first line, and leave the second line empty.ExamplesInput31 1 2 2 3 30 1 1 0 2 29 3 7 9 9 8OutputNOYES3.5 1.5 0.5 2.5 -0.5 -0.5 2.5 0.5NO",
