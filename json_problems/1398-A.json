Bad Triangletime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots , a_n$$$, which is sorted in non-decreasing order ($$$a_i \\\\le a_{i + 1})$$$.Find three indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le i < j < k \\\\le n$$$ and it isimpossibleto construct a non-degenerate triangle (a triangle with nonzero area) having sides equal to $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_j$$$ and $$$a_k$$$ (for example it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle with sides $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ but impossible with sides $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$7$$$). If it is impossible to find such triple, report it.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots , a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$; $$$a_{i - 1} \\\\le a_i$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print the answer to it in one line.If there is a triple of indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$i < j < k$$$) such that it isimpossibleto construct a non-degenerate triangle having sides equal to $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_j$$$ and $$$a_k$$$, print that three indices in ascending order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.Otherwise, print-1.ExampleInput3 7 4 6 11 11 15 18 20 4 10 10 10 11 3 1 1 1000000000Output2 3 6 -1 1 2 3NoteIn the first test case it is impossible with sides $$$6$$$, $$$11$$$ and $$$18$$$. Note, that this is not the only correct answer.In the second test case you always can construct a non-degenerate triangle.",
