Letters Rearrangingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.You can rearrange all letters of this string as you wish. Your task is to obtain agoodstring by rearranging the letters of the given string or report that it is impossible to do it.Let's call a stringgoodif it is not a palindrome. Palindrome is a string which is read from left to right the same as from right to left. For example, strings \"abacaba\", \"aa\" and \"z\" are palindromes and strings \"bba\", \"xd\" are not.You have to answer $$$t$$$independentqueries.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) â€” number of queries.Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains one string. The $$$i$$$-th line contains a string $$$s_i$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letter. It is guaranteed that thelengthof $$$s_i$$$ isfrom $$$1$$$ to $$$1000$$$(inclusive).OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines. In the $$$i$$$-th line print the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query:-1if it is impossible to obtain agoodstring by rearranging the letters of $$$s_i$$$ andany goodstring which can be obtained from the given one (by rearranging the letters) otherwise.ExampleInput3 aa abacaba xddOutput-1 abaacba xddNoteIn the first query we cannot rearrange letters to obtain agoodstring.Other examples (not all) of correct answers to the second query: \"ababaca\", \"abcabaa\", \"baacaba\".In the third query we can do nothing to obtain agoodstring.",
