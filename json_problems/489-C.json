Your task is to find the smallest and the largest of the numbers that have lengthmand sum of digitss. The required numbers should be non-negative integers written in the decimal base without leading zeroes.InputThe single line of the input contains a pair of integersm,s(1 ≤m≤ 100, 0 ≤s≤ 900) — the length and the sum of the digits of the required numbers.OutputIn the output print the pair of the required non-negative integer numbers — first the minimum possible number, then — the maximum possible number. If no numbers satisfying conditions required exist, print the pair of numbers \"-1 -1\" (without the quotes).ExamplesInput2 15Output69 96Input3 0Output-1 -1",
