Beaver Gametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutTwo beavers, Timur and Marsel, play the following game.There arenlogs, each of exactlymmeters in length. The beavers move in turns. For each move a beaver chooses a log and gnaws it into some number (more than one) ofequalparts, the length of each one is expressed by an integer and is no less thankmeters. Each resulting part is also a log which can be gnawed in future by any beaver. The beaver that can't make a move loses. Thus, the other beaver wins.Timur makes the first move. The players play in the optimal way. Determine the winner.InputThe first line contains three integersn,m,k(1 ≤n,m,k≤ 109).OutputPrint \"Timur\", if Timur wins, or \"Marsel\", if Marsel wins. You should print everything without the quotes.ExamplesInput1 15 4OutputTimurInput4 9 5OutputMarselNoteIn the first sample the beavers only have one log, of15meters in length. Timur moves first. The only move he can do is to split the log into3parts each5meters in length. Then Marsel moves but he can't split any of the resulting logs, ask= 4. Thus, the winner is Timur.In the second example the beavers have4logs9meters in length. Timur can't split any of them, so that the resulting parts possessed the length of not less than5meters, that's why he loses instantly.",
