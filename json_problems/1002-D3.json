Oracle for majority functiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputImplement a quantum oracle on 3 qubits which implements a majority function. Majority function on 3-bit vectors is defined as follows:if vectorhas two or three 1s, and 0 if it has zero or one 1s.For an explanation on how this type of quantum oracles works, seeIntroduction to quantum oracles.You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:an array of 3 qubitsxin arbitrary state (input register),a qubityin arbitrary state (output qubit).The operation doesn't have an output; its \"output\" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit) : (){body{// your code here}}}",
