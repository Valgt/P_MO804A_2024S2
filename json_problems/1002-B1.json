Distinguish zero state and W statetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are givenNqubits (2 ≤N≤ 8) which are guaranteed to be in one of the two states:state, orstate.Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 0 if it wasstate or 1 if it was W state. The state of the qubits after the operations does not matter.You have to implement an operation which takes an array ofNqubits as an input and returns an integer.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int{body{// your code here}}}",
