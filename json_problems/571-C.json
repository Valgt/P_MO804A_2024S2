CNF 2time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output'In Boolean logic, a formula is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) or clausal normal form if it is a conjunction of clauses, where a clause is a disjunction of literals' (cited from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form)In the other words, CNF is a formula of type, where&represents a logical \"AND\" (conjunction),represents a logical \"OR\" (disjunction), andvijare some boolean variables or their negations. Each statement in brackets is called aclause, andvijare calledliterals.You are given a CNF containing variablesx1, ...,xmand their negations. We know that each variable occurs in at most two clauses (with negation and without negation in total). Your task is to determine whether this CNF issatisfiable, that is, whether there are such values of variables where the CNF value is true. If CNF is satisfiable, then you also need to determine the values of the variables at which the CNF is true.It is guaranteed that each variable occurs at most once in each clause.InputThe first line contains integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 2·105) — the number of clauses and the number variables, correspondingly.Nextnlines contain the descriptions of each clause. Thei-th line first contains first numberki(ki≥ 1) — the number of literals in thei-th clauses. Then follow space-separated literalsvij(1 ≤ |vij| ≤m).
