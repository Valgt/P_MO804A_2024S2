X Axistime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three points with integer coordinates $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, and $$$x_3$$$ on the $$$X$$$ axis ($$$1 \\\\leq x_i \\\\leq 10$$$). You can choose any point with an integer coordinate $$$a$$$ on the $$$X$$$ axis. Note that the point $$$a$$$ may coincide with $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, or $$$x_3$$$. Let $$$f(a)$$$ be the total distance from the given points to the point $$$a$$$. Find the smallest value of $$$f(a)$$$.The distance between points $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ is equal to $$$|a - b|$$$. For example, the distance between points $$$a = 5$$$ and $$$b = 2$$$ is $$$3$$$.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows their descriptions.The single line of each test case contains three integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, and $$$x_3$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x_i \\\\leq 10$$$) — the coordinates of the points.OutputFor each test case, output the smallest value of $$$f(a)$$$.ExampleInput81 1 11 5 98 2 810 9 32 1 12 4 17 3 51 9 4Output0 8 6 7 1 3 4 8NoteIn the first test case, the smallest value of $$$f(a)$$$ is achieved when $$$a = 1$$$: $$$f(1) = |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 0$$$.In the second test case, the smallest value of $$$f(a)$$$ is achieved when $$$a = 5$$$: $$$f(5) = |1 - 5| + |5 - 5| + |9 - 5| = 8$$$.In the third test case, the smallest value of $$$f(a)$$$ is achieved when $$$a = 8$$$: $$$f(8) = |8 - 8| + |2 - 8| + |8 - 8| = 6$$$.In the fourth test case, the smallest value of $$$f(a)$$$ is achieved when $$$a = 9$$$: $$$f(10) = |10 - 9| + |9 - 9| + |3 - 9| = 7$$$.",
