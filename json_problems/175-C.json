Geometry Horsetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutVasya plays the Geometry Horse.The game goal is to destroy geometric figures of the game world. A certain number of points is given for destroying each figure depending on the figure type and the current factor value.There arentypes of geometric figures. The number of figures of typekiand figure costciis known for each figure type. A player getsci·fpoints for destroying one figure of typei, wherefis the current factor. The factor value can be an integer number from1tot+ 1, inclusive. At the beginning of the game the factor value is equal to 1. The factor is set toi+ 1after destruction ofpi(1 ≤i≤t)figures, so the(pi+ 1)-th figure to be destroyed is considered with factor equal toi+ 1.Your task is to determine the maximum number of points Vasya can get after he destroys all figures. Take into account that Vasya is so tough that he can destroy figures in any order chosen by him.InputThe first line contains the only integer numbern(1 ≤n≤ 100)— the number of figure types.Each of the followingnlines contains two integer numberskiandci(1 ≤ki≤ 109, 0 ≤ci≤ 1000), separated with space — the number of figures of thei-th type and the cost of onei-type figure, correspondingly.The next line contains the only integer numbert(1 ≤t≤ 100)— the number that describe the factor's changes.The next line containstinteger numberspi(1 ≤p1<p2< ... <pt≤ 1012), separated with spaces.Please, do not use the%lldspecificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to usecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecificator.OutputPrint the only number — the maximum number of points Vasya can get.ExamplesInput15 1023 6Output70Input23 85 10120Output74NoteIn the first example Vasya destroys three figures first and gets3·1·10 = 30points. Then the factor will become equal to2and after destroying the last two figures Vasya will get2·2·10 = 40points. As a result Vasya will get70points.In the second example all8figures will be destroyed with factor1, so Vasya will get(3·8 + 5·10)·1 = 74points.",
