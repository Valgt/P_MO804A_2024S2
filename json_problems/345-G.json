The following two conditions must hold:there exists a stringtsuch, that each string from found subgroup is its suffix;the number of strings in the found subgroup is as large as possible.Your task is to print the number of strings in the found subgroup.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 105)— the number of strings in the group. Each of the nextnlines contains a string. Thei-th line contains non-empty stringsi.Each string consists only from lowercase Latin letters.
