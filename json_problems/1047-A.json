He loves all things about it.Now he has a positive integer $$$n$$$. He wants to split $$$n$$$ into $$$3$$$ positive integers $$$a,b,c$$$, such that $$$a+b+c=n$$$ and none of the $$$3$$$ integers is a multiple of $$$3$$$. Help him to find a solution.InputA single line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the integer Little C has.OutputPrint $$$3$$$ positive integers $$$a,b,c$$$ in a single line, such that $$$a+b+c=n$$$ and none of them is a multiple of $$$3$$$.It can be proved that there is at least one solution. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput3Output1 1 1Input233Output77 77 79",
