Each second, you do the following. With probabilitypa/ (pa+pb), add 'a' to the end of the sequence. Otherwise (with probabilitypb/ (pa+pb)), add 'b' to the end of the sequence.You stop once there are at leastksubsequences that form 'ab'. Determine the expected number of times 'ab' is a subsequence in the resulting sequence. It can be shown that this can be represented byP/Q, wherePandQare coprime integers, and.

For instance, we get the sequence 'ab' with probability 1/4, 'bbab' with probability 1/16, and 'aab' with probability 1/8. Note, it's impossible for us to end with a sequence like 'aabab', since we would have stopped our algorithm once we had the prefix 'aab'.The expected amount of times that 'ab' will occur across all valid sequences is 2.For the second sample, the answer is equal to.",
