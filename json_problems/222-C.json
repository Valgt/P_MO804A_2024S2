Reducing Fractionstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutTo confuse the opponents, the Galactic Empire represents fractions in an unusual format. The fractions are represented as two sets of integers. The product of numbers from the first set gives the fraction numerator, the product of numbers from the second set gives the fraction denominator. However, it turned out that the programs that work with fractions in this representations aren't complete, they lack supporting the operation of reducing fractions. Implement this operation and the Empire won't forget you.InputThe first input line contains two space-separated integersn,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 105) that show how many numbers the first set (the numerator) and the second set (the denominator) contain, correspondingly.The second line containsnspace-separated integers:a1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 107) — the numbers that are multiplied to produce the numerator.The third line containsmspace-separated integers:b1,b2, ...,bm(1 ≤bi≤ 107) — the numbers that are multiplied to produce the denominator.OutputPrint the answer to the problem in the form, similar to the form of the input data. The number of values in the sets you printnout,moutmust satisfy the inequality1 ≤nout,mout≤ 105, and the actual values in the setsaout,iandbout,imust satisfy the inequality1 ≤aout,i,bout,i≤ 107.Separate the values in the lines by spaces. The printed fraction must be reduced, that is, there mustn't be such integerx(x> 1), that the numerator and the denominator of the printed fraction are divisible byx. If there are several matching answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput3 2100 5 250 10Output2 32 11 1 1Input4 32 5 10 20100 1 3Output1 1203NoteIn the first test sample the numerator equals 1000, the denominator equals 500. If we reduce fraction 1000/500 by the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator (by 500), we obtain fraction 2/1.In the second test sample the numerator equals 2000, the denominator equals 300. If we reduce fraction 2000/300 by the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator (by 100), we obtain fraction 20/3.",
