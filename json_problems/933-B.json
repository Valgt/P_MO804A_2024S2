But now he regrets doing this...Given two integerspandk, find a polynomialf(x)with non-negative integer coefficients strictly less thank, whose remainder ispwhen divided by(x+k). That is,f(x) =q(x)·(x+k) +p, whereq(x)is a polynomial (not necessarily with integer coefficients).InputThe only line of input contains two space-separated integerspandk(1 ≤p≤ 1018,2 ≤k≤ 2 000).OutputIf the polynomial does not exist, print a single integer-1, or output two lines otherwise.In the first line print a non-negative integerd— the number of coefficients in the polynomial.In the second line printdspace-separated integersa0,a1, ...,ad- 1, describing a polynomialfulfilling the given requirements.
