Heidi and Library (easy)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYour search for Heidi is over – you finally found her at a library, dressed up as a human. In fact, she has spent so much time there that she now runs the place! Her job is to buy books and keep them at the library so that people can borrow and read them. There arendifferent books, numbered1throughn.We will look at the library's operation duringnconsecutive days. Heidi knows in advance that on thei-th day (1 ≤i≤n) precisely one person will come to the library, request to borrow the bookai, read it in a few hours, and return the book later on the same day.Heidi desperately wants to please all her guests, so she will make sure to always have the bookaiavailable in the library on thei-th day. During the night before thei-th day, she has the option of going to the bookstore (which operates at nights to avoid competition with the library) and buying any book for the price of 1 CHF. Of course, if she already has a book at the library, she does not need to buy it again. Initially, the library contains no books.There is a problem, though. The capacity of the library isk– this means that at any time, there can be at mostkbooks at the library. If buying a new book would cause Heidi to have more thankbooks, she must first get rid of some book that she already has, in order to make room for the new book. If she later needs a book that she got rid of, she will need to buy that book again.You are givenkand the sequence of requests for booksa1,a2, ...,an. What is the minimum cost (in CHF) of buying new books to satisfy all the requests?InputThe first line of input will contain two integersnandk(1 ≤n,k≤ 80). The second line will containnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤n) – the sequence of book requests.OutputOn a single line print the minimum cost of buying books at the store so as to satisfy all requests.ExamplesInput4 801 2 2 1Output2Input4 11 2 2 1Output3Input4 21 2 3 1Output3NoteIn the first test case, Heidi is able to keep all books forever. Therefore, she only needs to buy the book1before the first day and the book2before the second day.In the second test case, she can only keep one book at a time. Therefore she will need to buy new books on the first, second and fourth day.In the third test case, before buying book3on the third day, she must decide which of the books1and2she should get rid of. Of course, she should keep the book1, which will be requested on the fourth day.",
