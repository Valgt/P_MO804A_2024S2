Remove One Elementtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.You can removeat most oneelement from this array. Thus, the final length of the array is $$$n-1$$$ or $$$n$$$.Your task is to calculate the maximum possible length of thestrictly increasingcontiguous subarray of the remaining array.Recall that the contiguous subarray $$$a$$$ with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ is $$$a[l \\\\dots r] = a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\\\dots, a_r$$$. The subarray $$$a[l \\\\dots r]$$$ is called strictly increasing if $$$a_l < a_{l+1} < \\\\dots < a_r$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum possible length of thestrictly increasingcontiguous subarray of the array $$$a$$$ after removing at most one element.ExamplesInput5 1 2 5 3 4Output4Input2 1 2Output2Input7 6 5 4 3 2 4 3Output2NoteIn the first example, you can delete $$$a_3=5$$$. Then the resulting array will be equal to $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$ and the length of its largest increasing subarray will be equal to $$$4$$$.",
