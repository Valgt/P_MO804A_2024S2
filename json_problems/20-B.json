Any coefficient may be equal to 0.OutputIn case of infinite root count print the only integer-1. In case of no roots print the only integer0. In other cases print the number of root on the first line and the roots on the following lines in the ascending order. Print roots with at least 5 digits after the decimal point.ExamplesInput1 -5 6Output22.00000000003.0000000000",
