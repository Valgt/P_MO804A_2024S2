Sum of 2050time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA number is called2050-numberif it is $$$2050$$$, $$$20500$$$, ..., ($$$2050 \\\\cdot 10^k$$$ for integer $$$k \\\\ge 0$$$).Given a number $$$n$$$, you are asked to represent $$$n$$$ as the sum of some (not necessarily distinct) 2050-numbers. Compute the minimum number of 2050-numbers required for that.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1\\\\le T\\\\leq 1\\\\,000$$$) denoting the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 10^{18}$$$) denoting the number to be represented.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum number of 2050-numbers in one line.If $$$n$$$ cannot be represented as the sum of 2050-numbers, output $$$-1$$$ instead.ExampleInput6 205 2050 4100 20500 22550 25308639900Output-1 1 2 1 2 36NoteIn the third case, $$$4100 = 2050 + 2050$$$.In the fifth case, $$$22550 = 20500 + 2050$$$.",
