Additionally, it is guaranteed thatpforms a non-decreasing sequence at all times.OutputPrint a real number for every request of type2— the probability that boy will \"dominate\" on that interval. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed10- 4.Namely: let's assume that one of your answers isa, and the corresponding answer of the jury isb. The checker program will consider your answer correct if|a-b| ≤ 10- 4.ExampleInput3 131 31 22 32 1 12 1 22 1 32 2 22 2 32 3 31 2 2 32 1 12 1 22 1 32 2 22 2 32 3 3Output0.33333333330.20000000000.16666666670.50000000000.40000000000.66666666670.33333333330.25000000000.22222222220.66666666670.57142857140.6666666667",
