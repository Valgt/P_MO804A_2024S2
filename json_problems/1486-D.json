    "statement": "D. Max Mediantime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are a given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Find a subarray $$$a[l..r]$$$ with length at least $$$k$$$ with the largest median.A median in an array of length $$$n$$$ is an element which occupies position number $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n + 1}{2} \\\\rfloor$$$ after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example: $$$median([1, 2, 3, 4]) = 2$$$, $$$median([3, 2, 1]) = 2$$$, $$$median([2, 1, 2, 1]) = 1$$$.Subarray $$$a[l..r]$$$ is a contiguous part of the array $$$a$$$, i. e. the array $$$a_l,a_{l+1},\\\\ldots,a_r$$$ for some $$$1 \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq n$$$, its length is $$$r - l + 1$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq n$$$).OutputOutput one integer $$$m$$$ — the maximum median you can get.ExamplesInput5 3 1 2 3 2 1Output2Input4 2 1 2 3 4Output3NoteIn the first example all the possible subarrays are $$$[1..3]$$$, $$$[1..4]$$$, $$$[1..5]$$$, $$$[2..4]$$$, $$$[2..5]$$$ and $$$[3..5]$$$ and the median for all of them is $$$2$$$, so the maximum possible median is $$$2$$$ too.In the second example $$$median([3..4]) = 3$$$.",
