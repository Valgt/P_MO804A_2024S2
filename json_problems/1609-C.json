Complex Market Analysistime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWhile performing complex market analysis William encountered the following problem:For a given array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ and a natural number $$$e$$$, calculate the number of pairs of natural numbers $$$(i, k)$$$ which satisfy the following conditions:$$$1 \\\\le i, k$$$$$$i + e \\\\cdot k \\\\le n$$$.Product $$$a_i \\\\cdot a_{i + e} \\\\cdot a_{i + 2 \\\\cdot e} \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot a_{i + k \\\\cdot e} $$$ is a prime number.A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10\\\\,000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$e$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le e \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5)$$$, the number of items in the array and number $$$e$$$, respectively.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6)$$$, the contents of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case output the answer in the following format:Output one line containing the number of pairs of numbers $$$(i, k)$$$ which satisfy the conditions.ExampleInput6 7 3 10 2 1 3 1 19 3 3 2 1 13 1 9 3 2 4 2 1 1 1 1 4 2 3 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2Output2 0 4 0 5 0NoteIn the first example test case two pairs satisfy the conditions:$$$i = 2, k = 1$$$, for which the product is: $$$a_{2} \\\\cdot a_{5} = 2$$$ which is a prime number.$$$i = 3, k = 1$$$, for which the product is: $$$a_{3} \\\\cdot a_{6} = 19$$$ which is a prime number.In the second example test case there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.In the third example test case four pairs satisfy the conditions:$$$i = 1, k = 1$$$, for which the product is: $$$a_{1} \\\\cdot a_{4} = 2$$$ which is a prime number.$$$i = 1, k = 2$$$, for which the product is: $$$a_{1} \\\\cdot a_{4} \\\\cdot a_{7} = 2$$$ which is a prime number.$$$i = 3, k = 1$$$, for which the product is: $$$a_{3} \\\\cdot a_{6} = 2$$$ which is a prime number.$$$i = 6, k = 1$$$, for which the product is: $$$a_{6} \\\\cdot a_{9} = 2$$$ which is a prime number.In the fourth example test case there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.In the fifth example test case five pairs satisfy the conditions:$$$i = 1, k = 1$$$, for which the product is: $$$a_{1} \\\\cdot a_{2} = 2$$$ which is a prime number.$$$i = 1, k = 2$$$, for which the product is: $$$a_{1} \\\\cdot a_{2} \\\\cdot a_{3} = 2$$$ which is a prime number.$$$i = 1, k = 3$$$, for which the product is: $$$a_{1} \\\\cdot a_{2} \\\\cdot a_{3} \\\\cdot a_{4} = 2$$$ which is a prime number.$$$i = 2, k = 1$$$, for which the product is: $$$a_{2} \\\\cdot a_{3} = 2$$$ which is a prime number.$$$i = 2, k = 2$$$, for which the product is: $$$a_{2} \\\\cdot a_{3} \\\\cdot a_{4} = 2$$$ which is a prime number.In the sixth example test case there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.",
