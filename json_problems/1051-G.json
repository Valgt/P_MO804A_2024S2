That can be performed only if there exists at least one such position $$$j$$$ that $$$i \\\\ne j$$$ and $$$a_i = a_j$$$. The cost of this operation is $$$b_i$$$;Choose some position $$$i$$$ anddecrease$$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$. That can be performed only if there exists at least one such position $$$j$$$ that $$$a_i = a_j + 1$$$. The cost of this operation is $$$-b_i$$$.Each operation can be performed arbitrary number of times (possibly zero).Let $$$f(S)$$$ be minimum possible $$$x$$$ such that there exists a sequence of operations with total cost $$$x$$$, after which all $$$a_i$$$ from $$$S$$$ are pairwise distinct.Now for the task itself ...You are given a sequence $$$P$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ pairs of integers $$$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \\\\dots, (a_n, b_n)$$$. All $$$b_i$$$ are pairwise distinct. Let $$$P_i$$$ be the sequence consisting of the first $$$i$$$ pairs of $$$P$$$. Your task is to calculate the values of $$$f(P_1), f(P_2), \\\\dots, f(P_n)$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of pairs in sequence $$$P$$$.Next $$$n$$$ lines contain the elements of $$$P$$$: $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that all values of $$$b_i$$$ are pairwise distinct.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers — the $$$i$$$-th number should be equal to $$$f(P_i)$$$.ExamplesInput51 13 35 54 22 4Output000-5-16Input42 42 32 21 1Output0371",
