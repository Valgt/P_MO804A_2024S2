    "statement": "E. Unique Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. A subarray of $$$a$$$ is one of its contiguous subsequences (i. e. an array $$$[a_l, a_{l+1}, \\\\dots, a_r]$$$ for some integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le l < r \\\\le n$$$). Let's call a subarrayuniqueif there is an integer that occurs exactly once in the subarray.You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose an element of the array and replace it with any integer.Your task is to calculate the minimum number of aforementioned operation in order for all the subarrays of the array $$$a$$$ to be unique.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$).Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of aforementioned operation in order for all the subarrays of the array $$$a$$$ to be unique.ExampleInput432 1 244 4 4 453 1 2 1 251 3 2 1 2Output0 2 1 0NoteIn the second test case, you can replace the $$$1$$$-st and the $$$3$$$-rd element, for example, like this: $$$[3, 4, 1, 4]$$$.In the third test case, you can replace the $$$4$$$-th element, for example, like this: $$$[3, 1, 2, 3, 2]$$$.",
