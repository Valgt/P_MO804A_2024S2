When the courier delivered the pizza, he was very upset, because several pieces of sausage lay on the crust, and he does not really like the crust.The pizza is a circle of radiusrand center at the origin. Pizza consists of the main part — circle of radiusr-dwith center at the origin, and crust around the main part of the widthd. Pieces of sausage are also circles. The radius of thei-th piece of the sausage isri, and the center is given as a pair (xi,yi).Gleb asks you to help determine the number of pieces of sausage caught on the crust. A piece of sausage got on the crust, if it completely lies on the crust.InputFirst string contains two integer numbersrandd(0 ≤d<r≤ 500) — the radius of pizza and the width of crust.Next line contains one integer numbern— the number of pieces of sausage (1 ≤n≤ 105).Each of nextnlines contains three integer numbersxi,yiandri(- 500 ≤xi,yi≤ 500,0 ≤ri≤ 500), wherexiandyiare coordinates of the center ofi-th peace of sausage,ri— radius ofi-th peace of sausage.OutputOutput the number of pieces of sausage that lay on the crust.ExamplesInput8 477 8 1-7 3 20 2 10 -2 2-3 -3 10 6 25 3 1Output2Input10 840 0 90 0 101 0 11 0 2Output0NoteBelow is a picture explaining the first example.
