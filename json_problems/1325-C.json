You want to write some labels on the tree's edges such that the following conditions hold:Every label is an integer between $$$0$$$ and $$$n-2$$$ inclusive.All the written labels are distinct.The largest value among $$$MEX(u,v)$$$ over all pairs of nodes $$$(u,v)$$$ is as small as possible.Here, $$$MEX(u,v)$$$ denotes the smallest non-negative integer that isn't written on any edge on the unique simple path from node $$$u$$$ to node $$$v$$$.InputThe first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes in the tree.Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two space-separated integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u,v \\\\le n$$$) that mean there's an edge between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It's guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.OutputOutput $$$n-1$$$ integers. The $$$i^{th}$$$ of them will be the number written on the $$$i^{th}$$$ edge (in the input order).ExamplesInput3 1 2 1 3Output0 1Input6 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 5 6Output0 3 2 4 1NoteThe tree from the second sample:",
