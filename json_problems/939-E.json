Maximize!time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a multisetSconsisting of positive integers (initially empty). There are two kind of queries:Add a positive integer toS, the newly added integer is not less than any number in it.Find a subsetsof the setSsuch that the valueis maximum possible. Heremax(s)means maximum value of elements ins,— the average value of numbers ins. Output this maximum possible value of.InputThe first line contains a single integerQ(1 ≤Q≤ 5·105) — the number of queries.Each of the nextQlines contains a description of query. For queries of type1two integers1andxare given, wherex(1 ≤x≤ 109) is a number that you should add toS. It's guaranteed thatxis not less than any number inS. For queries of type2, a single integer2is given.It's guaranteed that the first query has type1, i. e.Sis not empty when a query of type2comes.OutputOutput the answer for each query of the second type in the order these queries are given in input. Each number should be printed in separate line.Your answer is considered correct, if each of your answers has absolute or relative error not greater than10- 6.Formally, let your answer bea, and the jury's answer beb.
