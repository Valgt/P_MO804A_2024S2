For each day we know the forecast for the average air temperature that day.Vasya has a new set of winter tires which allows him to drive safely no more thankdays at any average air temperature. Afterkdays of using it (regardless of the temperature of these days) the set of winter tires wears down and cannot be used more. It is not necessary that thesekdays form a continuous segment of days.Before the first winter day Vasya still usessummer tires. It is possible to drive safely on summer tires any number of days when the average air temperature isnon-negative. It is impossible to drive on summer tires at days when the average air temperature is negative.Vasya can change summer tires to winter tires and vice versa at the beginning of any day.Find the minimum number of times Vasya needs to change summer tires to winter tires and vice versa to drive safely during the winter. At the end of the winter the car can be with any set of tires.InputThe first line contains two positive integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 2·105,0 ≤k≤n) — the number of winter days and the number of days winter tires can be used. It is allowed to drive on winter tires at any temperature, but no more thankdays in total.The second line contains a sequence ofnintegerst1,t2, ...,tn(- 20 ≤ti≤ 20) — the average air temperature in thei-th winter day.OutputPrint the minimum number of times Vasya has to change summer tires to winter tires and vice versa to drive safely during all winter. If it is impossible, print-1.ExamplesInput4 3-5 20 -3 0Output2Input4 2-5 20 -3 0Output4Input10 62 -5 1 3 0 0 -4 -3 1 0Output3NoteIn the first example before the first winter day Vasya should change summer tires to winter tires, use it for three days, and then change winter tires to summer tires because he can drive safely with the winter tires for just three days. Thus, the total number of tires' changes equals two.In the second example before the first winter day Vasya should change summer tires to winter tires, and then after the first winter day change winter tires to summer tires. After the second day it is necessary to change summer tires to winter tires again, and after the third day it is necessary to change winter tires to summer tires. Thus, the total number of tires' changes equals four.",
