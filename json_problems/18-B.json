Grasshopper Bob starts to jump along the platforms from point0, with each jump he moves exactlydunits right. Find out the coordinate of the point, where Bob will fall down. The grasshopper falls down, if he finds himself not on the platform, but if he finds himself on the edge of the platform, he doesn't fall down.InputThe first input line contains 4 integer numbersn,d,m,l(1 ≤n,d,m,l≤ 106,l<m) — respectively: amount of platforms, length of the grasshopper Bob's jump, and numbersmandlneeded to find coordinates of thek-th platform:[(k- 1)m, (k- 1)m+l].OutputOutput the coordinates of the point, where the grosshopper will fall down.
