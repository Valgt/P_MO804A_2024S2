Almost Rectangletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a square field of size $$$n \\\\times n$$$ in which two cells are marked. These cells can be in the same row or column.You are to mark two more cells so that they are the corners of a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.For example, if $$$n=4$$$ and a rectangular field looks like this (there are asterisks in the marked cells):$$$$$$ \\\\begin{matrix} . & . & * & . \\\\\\\\ . & . & . & . \\\\\\\\ * & . & . & . \\\\\\\\ . & . & . & . \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix} $$$$$$Then you can mark two more cells as follows$$$$$$ \\\\begin{matrix} * & . & * & . \\\\\\\\ . & . & . & . \\\\\\\\ * & . & * & . \\\\\\\\ . & . & . & . \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix} $$$$$$If there are several possible solutions, then print any of them.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 400$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first row of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 400$$$) — the number of rows and columns in the table.The following $$$n$$$ lines each contain $$$n$$$ characters '.' or '*' denoting empty and marked cells, respectively.It is guaranteed that the sums of $$$n$$$ for all test cases do not exceed $$$400$$$.It is guaranteed that there are exactly two asterisks on the field. They can be in the same row/column.It is guaranteed that the solution exists.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ rows of $$$n$$$ characters — a field with four asterisks marked corresponding to the statements. If there multiple correct answers, print any of them.ExampleInput6 4 ..*. .... *... .... 2 *. .* 2 .* .* 3 *.* ... ... 5 ..... ..*.. ..... .*... ..... 4 .... .... *... *...Output*.*. .... *.*. .... ** ** ** ** *.* *.* ... ..... .**.. ..... .**.. ..... .... .... **.. **..",
