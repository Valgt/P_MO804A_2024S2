Cyphertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLuca has a cypher made up of a sequence of $$$n$$$ wheels, each with a digit $$$a_i$$$ written on it. On the $$$i$$$-th wheel, he made $$$b_i$$$ moves. Each move is one of two types:upmove (denoted by $$$\\\\texttt{U}$$$): it increases the $$$i$$$-th digit by $$$1$$$. After applying the up move on $$$9$$$, it becomes $$$0$$$.downmove (denoted by $$$\\\\texttt{D}$$$): it decreases the $$$i$$$-th digit by $$$1$$$. After applying the down move on $$$0$$$, it becomes $$$9$$$.Example for $$$n=4$$$. The current sequence is0 0 0 0.Luca knows the final sequence of wheels and the moves for each wheel. Help him find the original sequence and crack the cypher.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of wheels.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 9$$$) — the digit shown on the $$$i$$$-th wheel after all moves have been performed.Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains the integer $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq b_i \\\\leq 10$$$) and $$$b_i$$$ characters that are either $$$\\\\texttt{U}$$$ or $$$\\\\texttt{D}$$$ — the number of moves performed on the $$$i$$$-th wheel, and the moves performed. $$$\\\\texttt{U}$$$ and $$$\\\\texttt{D}$$$ represent anupmove and adownmove respectively.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ space-separated digits  — the initial sequence of the cypher.ExampleInput339 3 13 DDD4 UDUU2 DU20 99 DDDDDDDDD9 UUUUUUUUU50 5 9 8 310 UUUUUUUUUU3 UUD8 UUDUUDDD10 UUDUUDUDDU4 UUUUOutput2 1 1  9 0  0 4 9 6 9NoteIn the first test case, we can prove that initial sequence was $$$[2,1,1]$$$. In that case, the following moves were performed:On the first wheel: $$$2 \\\\xrightarrow[\\\\texttt{D}]{} 1 \\\\xrightarrow[\\\\texttt{D}]{} 0 \\\\xrightarrow[\\\\texttt{D}]{} 9$$$.On the second wheel: $$$1 \\\\xrightarrow[\\\\texttt{U}]{} 2 \\\\xrightarrow[\\\\texttt{D}]{} 1 \\\\xrightarrow[\\\\texttt{U}]{} 2 \\\\xrightarrow[\\\\texttt{U}]{} 3$$$.On the third wheel: $$$1 \\\\xrightarrow[\\\\texttt{D}]{} 0 \\\\xrightarrow[\\\\texttt{U}]{} 1$$$.The final sequence was $$$[9,3,1]$$$, which matches the input.",
