Pretty Permutationstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ cats in a line, labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, with the $$$i$$$-th cat at position $$$i$$$. They are bored of gyrating in the same spot all day, so they want to reorder themselves such that no cat is in the same place as before. They are also lazy, so they want to minimize the total distance they move. Help them decide what cat should be at each location after the reordering.For example, if there are $$$3$$$ cats, this is a valid reordering: $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$. No cat is in its original position. The total distance the cats move is $$$1 + 1 + 2 = 4$$$ as cat $$$1$$$ moves one place to the right, cat $$$2$$$ moves one place to the right, and cat $$$3$$$ moves two places to the left.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first and only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of cats.It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, an answer always exist.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ answers, one for each test case. Each answer consists of $$$n$$$ integers — a permutation with the minimum total distance. If there are multiple answers, print any.ExampleInput2 2 3Output2 1  3 1 2NoteFor the first test case, there is only one possible permutation that satisfies the conditions: $$$[2, 1]$$$.The second test case was described in the statement. Another possible answer is $$$[2, 3, 1]$$$.",
