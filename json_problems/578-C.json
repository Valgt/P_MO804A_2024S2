Weakness and Poornesstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a sequence of n integersa1,a2, ...,an.Determine a real numberxsuch that theweaknessof the sequencea1-x,a2-x, ...,an-xis as small as possible.Theweaknessof a sequence is defined as the maximum value of thepoornessover all segments (contiguous subsequences) of a sequence.Thepoornessof a segment is defined as the absolute value of sum of the elements of segment.InputThe first line contains one integern(1 ≤n≤ 200 000), the length of a sequence.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(|ai| ≤ 10 000).OutputOutput a real number denoting the minimum possibleweaknessofa1-x,a2-x, ...,an-x. Your answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed10- 6.ExamplesInput31 2 3Output1.000000000000000Input41 2 3 4Output2.000000000000000Input101 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6Output4.500000000000000NoteFor the first case, the optimal value ofxis2so the sequence becomes- 1,0,1and the max poorness occurs at the segment \"-1\" or segment \"1\". The poorness value (answer) equals to1in this case.For the second sample the optimal value ofxis2.5so the sequence becomes- 1.5,  - 0.5, 0.5, 1.5and the max poorness occurs on segment \"-1.5 -0.5\" or \"0.5 1.5\". The poorness value (answer) equals to2in this case.",
