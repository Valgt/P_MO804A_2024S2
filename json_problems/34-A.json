A reconnaissance unit can be made of such twoneighbouringsoldiers, whose heights difference is minimal, i.e.|ai-aj|is minimal. So each of them will be less noticeable with the other. Output any pair of soldiers that can form a reconnaissance unit.InputThe first line contains integern(2 ≤n≤ 100) — amount of soldiers. Then follow the heights of the soldiers in their order in the circle —nspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 1000).
