Diverse Substringstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA non-empty digit string isdiverseif the number of occurrences of each character in it doesn't exceed the number of distinct characters in it.For example:string \"7\" is diverse because7appears in it $$$1$$$ time and the number of distinct characters in it is $$$1$$$;string \"77\" isnotdiverse because7appears in it $$$2$$$ times and the number of distinct characters in it is $$$1$$$;string \"1010\" is diverse because both0and1appear in it $$$2$$$ times and the number of distinct characters in it is $$$2$$$;string \"6668\" isnotdiverse because6appears in it $$$3$$$ times and the number of distinct characters in it is $$$2$$$.You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of only digits $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$. Find how many of its $$$\\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$$ substrings are diverse.A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.Note that if the same diverse string appears in $$$s$$$ multiple times, each occurrence should be counted independently. For example, there are two diverse substrings in \"77\" both equal to \"7\", so the answer for the string \"77\" is $$$2$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that all characters of $$$s$$$ are digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print one integer — the number of diverse substrings of the given string $$$s$$$.ExampleInput71727741010501100639999652345618789987887987998798Output1 2 10 12 10 15 106NoteIn the first test case, the diverse substring is \"7\".In the second test case, the only diverse substring is \"7\", which appears twice, so the answer is $$$2$$$.In the third test case, the diverse substrings are \"0\" ($$$2$$$ times), \"01\", \"010\", \"1\" ($$$2$$$ times), \"10\" ($$$2$$$ times), \"101\" and \"1010\".In the fourth test case, the diverse substrings are \"0\" ($$$3$$$ times), \"01\", \"011\", \"0110\", \"1\" ($$$2$$$ times), \"10\", \"100\", \"110\" and \"1100\".In the fifth test case, the diverse substrings are \"3\", \"39\", \"399\", \"6\", \"9\" ($$$4$$$ times), \"96\" and \"996\".In the sixth test case, all $$$15$$$ non-empty substrings of \"23456\" are diverse.",
