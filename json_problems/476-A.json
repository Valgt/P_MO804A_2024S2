He can climb1or2steps at each move. Dreamoon wants the number of moves to be a multiple of an integerm.What is the minimal number of moves making him climb to the top of the stairs that satisfies his condition?InputThe single line contains two space separated integersn,m(0 <n≤ 10000, 1 <m≤ 10).OutputPrint a single integer — the minimal number of moves being a multiple ofm.

All these numbers are not multiples of 5.",
