Sereja is an active boy, so he is now going to completemoperations. Each operation will have one of the three forms:Makevi-th array element equal toxi. In other words, perform the assignmentavi=xi.Increase each array element byyi. In other words, performnassignmentsai=ai+yi(1 ≤i≤n).Take a piece of paper and write out theqi-th array element. That is, the elementaqi.Help Sereja, complete all his operations.InputThe first line contains integersn,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 105). The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109)— the original array.Nextmlines describe operations, thei-th line describes thei-th operation. The first number in thei-th line is integerti(1 ≤ti≤ 3)that represents the operation type. Ifti= 1, then it is followed by two integersviandxi,(1 ≤vi≤n, 1 ≤xi≤ 109). Ifti= 2, then it is followed by integeryi(1 ≤yi≤ 104). And ifti= 3, then it is followed by integerqi(1 ≤qi≤n).OutputFor each third type operation print valueaqi. Print the values in the order, in which the corresponding queries follow in the input.ExamplesInput10 111 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 103 23 92 103 13 101 1 102 102 103 13 103 9Output291120304039",
