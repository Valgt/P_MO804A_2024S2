A Random Code Problemtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer array $$$a_0, a_1, \\\\dots, a_{n - 1}$$$, and an integer $$$k$$$. You perform the following code with it:long long ans = 0; // create a 64-bit signed variable which is initially equal to 0for(int i = 1; i <= k; i++){int idx = rnd.next(0, n - 1); // generate a random integer between 0 and n - 1, both inclusive// each integer from 0 to n - 1 has the same probability of being chosenans += a[idx];a[idx] -= (a[idx] % i);}Your task is to calculate the expected value of the variableansafter performing this code.Note that the input is generated according to special rules (see the input format section).InputThe only line contains six integers $$$n$$$, $$$a_0$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$M$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^7$$$; $$$1 \\\\le a_0, x, y < M \\\\le 998244353$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 17$$$).The array $$$a$$$ in the input is constructed as follows:$$$a_0$$$ is given in the input;for every $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$, the value of $$$a_i$$$ can be calculated as $$$a_i = (a_{i - 1} \\\\cdot x + y) \\\\bmod M$$$.OutputLet the expected value of the variableansafter performing the code be $$$E$$$. It can be shown that $$$E \\\\cdot n^k$$$ is an integer. You have to output this integer modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExamplesInput3 10 3 5 13 88Output382842030Input2 15363 270880 34698 17 2357023Output319392398NoteThe array in the first example test is $$$[10, 35, 22]$$$.
