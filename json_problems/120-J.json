    "statement": "J. Minimum Sumtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputinput.txtoutputoutput.txtYou are given a set ofnvectors on a plane. For each vector you are allowed to multiply any of its coordinates by-1. Thus, each vectorvi= (xi,yi)can be transformed into one of the following four vectors:vi1= (xi,yi),vi2= ( -xi,yi),vi3= (xi,  -yi),vi4= ( -xi,  -yi).You should find two vectors from the set and determine which of their coordinates should be multiplied by-1so that the absolute value of the sum of the resulting vectors was minimally possible. More formally, you should choose two vectorsvi,vj(1 ≤i,j≤n,i≠j) and two numbersk1,k2(1 ≤k1,k2≤ 4), so that the value of the expression|vik1+vjk2|were minimum.InputThe first line contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 105). Thennlines contain vectors as pairs of integers \"xiyi\" (- 10000 ≤xi,yi≤ 10000), one pair per line.OutputPrint on the first line four space-separated numbers \"ik1jk2\" — the answer to the problem. If there are several variants the absolute value of whose sums is minimum, you can print any of them.ExamplesInput5-7 -39 0-8 67 -84 -5Output3 2 4 2Input53 2-4 7-6 0-8 45 1Output3 4 5 4NoteA sum of two vectorsv= (xv,yv)andu= (xu,yu)is vectors=v+u= (xv+xu,yv+yu).An absolute value of vectorv= (x,y)is number.In the second sample there are several valid answers, such as:(3 1 4 2), (3 1 4 4), (3 4 4 1), (3 4 4 3), (4 1 3 2), (4 1 3 4), (4 2 3 1).",
