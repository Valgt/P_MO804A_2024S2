The arc is made of a semicircle with radiusr(the cupboard's top) and two walls of heighth(the cupboard's sides). The cupboard's depth isr, that is, it looks like a rectangle with baserand heighth+rfrom the sides. The figure below shows what the cupboard looks like (the front view is on the left, the side view is on the right).Xenia got lots of balloons for her birthday. The girl hates the mess, so she wants to store the balloons in the cupboard. Luckily, each balloon is a sphere with radius.
