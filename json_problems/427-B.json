As the prison can't accommodate all of them, the city mayor has decided to transfercof the prisoners to a prison located in another city.For this reason, he made thenprisoners to stand in a line, with a number written on their chests. The number is the severity of the crime he/she has committed. The greater the number, the more severe his/her crime was.Then, the mayor told you to choose thecprisoners, who will be transferred to the other prison. He also imposed two conditions. They are,The chosencprisoners has to form a contiguous segment of prisoners.Any of the chosen prisoner's crime level should not be greater thent. Because, that will make the prisoner a severe criminal and the mayor doesn't want to take the risk of his running away during the transfer.Find the number of ways you can choose thecprisoners.InputThe first line of input will contain three space separated integersn(1 ≤n≤ 2·105),t(0 ≤t≤ 109)andc(1 ≤c≤n).
