Each lamp is colored red, green or blue. The color of the $$$i$$$-th lamp is $$$s_i$$$ ('R', 'G' and 'B' — colors of lamps in the garland).You have to recolor some lamps in this garland (recoloring a lamp means changing its initial color to another) in such a way that the obtained garland isnice.A garland is calledniceif any two lamps of the same color have distance divisible by three between them. I.e. if the obtained garland is $$$t$$$, then for each $$$i, j$$$ such that $$$t_i = t_j$$$ should be satisfied $$$|i-j|~ mod~ 3 = 0$$$. The value $$$|x|$$$ means absolute value of $$$x$$$, the operation $$$x~ mod~ y$$$ means remainder of $$$x$$$ when divided by $$$y$$$.For example, the following garlands arenice: \"RGBRGBRG\", \"GB\", \"R\", \"GRBGRBG\", \"BRGBRGB\". The following garlands are notnice: \"RR\", \"RGBG\".Among all ways to recolor the initial garland to make itniceyou have to choose one with theminimumnumber of recolored lamps. If there are multiple optimal solutions, printanyof them.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of lamps.The second line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ characters 'R', 'G' and 'B' — colors of lamps in the garland.OutputIn the first line of the output print one integer $$$r$$$ — theminimumnumber of recolors needed to obtain anicegarland from the given one.In the second line of the output print one string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ — anicegarland obtained from the initial one withminimumnumber of recolors.
