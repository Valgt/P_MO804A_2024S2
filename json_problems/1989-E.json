In other words, $$$b_i = \\\\min \\\\limits_{j \\\\in [1, n], a_j \\\\ne a_i} |i - j|$$$.For example, if $$$a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1]$$$, then $$$b = [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1]$$$.Calculate the number of different arrays $$$b$$$ you can obtain if you consider all possible arrays $$$a$$$, and print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le \\\\min(n, 10)$$$).OutputPrint one integer â€” the number of different arrays $$$b$$$ you can obtain, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExamplesInput2 2Output1Input4 3Output3Input6 2Output20Input6 5Output3Input133 7Output336975971",
