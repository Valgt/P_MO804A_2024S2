Integer Movestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere's a chip in the point $$$(0, 0)$$$ of the coordinate plane. In one operation, you can move the chip from some point $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ to some point $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ if the Euclidean distance between these two points is aninteger(i.e. $$$\\\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}$$$ is integer).Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to move the chip from the point $$$(0, 0)$$$ to the point $$$(x, y)$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 3000$$$) — number of test cases.The single line of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le x, y \\\\le 50$$$) — the coordinates of the destination point.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations required to move the chip from the point $$$(0, 0)$$$ to the point $$$(x, y)$$$.ExampleInput38 60 09 15Output1 0 2NoteIn the first example, one operation $$$(0, 0) \\\\rightarrow (8, 6)$$$ is enough. $$$\\\\sqrt{(0-8)^2+(0-6)^2}=\\\\sqrt{64+36}=\\\\sqrt{100}=10$$$ is an integer.In the second example, the chip is already at the destination point.In the third example, the chip can be moved as follows: $$$(0, 0) \\\\rightarrow (5, 12) \\\\rightarrow (9, 15)$$$. $$$\\\\sqrt{(0-5)^2+(0-12)^2}=\\\\sqrt{25+144}=\\\\sqrt{169}=13$$$ and $$$\\\\sqrt{(5-9)^2+(12-15)^2}=\\\\sqrt{16+9}=\\\\sqrt{25}=5$$$ are integers.",
