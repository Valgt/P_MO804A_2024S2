Here is a pseudocode of filling in a matrix of size(m+ 1) × (m+ 1):Maxim asks you to count, how many numbersm(1 ≤m≤n)are there, such that the sum of values in the cells in the row numberm+ 1of the resulting matrix equalst.Expression (xxory) means applying the operation of bitwise excluding \"OR\" to numbersxandy. The given operation exists in all modern programming languages.
