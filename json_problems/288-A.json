But most of all he adores strings of lengthn.One day he wanted to find a string that meets the following conditions:The string consists ofnlowercase English letters (that is, the string's length equalsn), exactlykof these letters are distinct.No two neighbouring letters of a string coincide; that is, if we represent a string ass=s1s2...sn, then the following inequality holds,si≠si+ 1(1 ≤i<n).Among all strings that meet points 1 and 2, the required string is lexicographically smallest.Help him find such string or state that such string doesn't exist.Stringx=x1x2...xpislexicographically lessthan stringy=y1y2...yq, if eitherp<qandx1=y1,x2=y2, ... ,xp=yp, or there is such numberr(r<p,r<q), thatx1=y1,x2=y2, ... ,xr=yrandxr+ 1<yr+ 1. The characters of the strings are compared by their ASCII codes.InputA single line contains two positive integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 106, 1 ≤k≤ 26)— the string's length and the number of distinct letters.OutputIn a single line print the required string. If there isn't such string, print \"-1\" (without the quotes).ExamplesInput7 4OutputababacdInput4 7Output-1",
