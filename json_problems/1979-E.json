Manhattan Triangletime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe Manhattan distance between two points $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ is defined as: $$$$$$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|.$$$$$$We call aManhattan trianglethree points on the plane, the Manhattan distances between each pair of which are equal.You are given a set of pairwise distinct points and aneveninteger $$$d$$$. Your task is to find any Manhattan triangle, composed of three distinct points from the given set, where the Manhattan distance between any pair of vertices is equal to $$$d$$$.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\\\le d \\\\le 4 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$d$$$ is even) — the number of points and the required Manhattan distance between the vertices of the triangle.The $$$(i + 1)$$$-th line of each test case contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point. It is guaranteed that all points are pairwise distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output three distinct integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i,j,k \\\\le n$$$) — the indices of the points forming the Manhattan triangle. If there is no solution, output \"$$$0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0$$$\" (without quotes).If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.ExampleInput66 43 10 00 -25 -33 -52 -25 40 00 -25 -33 -52 -26 63 10 00 -25 -33 -52 -24 43 00 3-3 00 -310 82 1-5 -1-4 -1-5 -30 1-2 5-4 4-4 20 0-4 14 400000100000 100000-100000 100000100000 -100000-100000 -100000Output2 6 1 4 3 5 3 5 1 0 0 0 6 1 3 0 0 0NoteIn the first test case:Points $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, and $$$F$$$ form a Manhattan triangle, the Manhattan distance between each pair of vertices is $$$4$$$. Points $$$D$$$, $$$E$$$, and $$$F$$$ can also be the answer.In the third test case:Points $$$A$$$, $$$C$$$, and $$$E$$$ form a Manhattan triangle, the Manhattan distance between each pair of vertices is $$$6$$$.In the fourth test case, there are no two points with a Manhattan distance of $$$4$$$, and therefore there is no suitable Manhattan triangle.",
