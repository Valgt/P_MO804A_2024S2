Valuable Cardstime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn his favorite cafe Kmes once again wanted to try the herring under a fur coat. Previously, it would not have been difficult for him to do this, but the cafe recently introduced a new purchasing policy.Now, in order to make a purchase, Kmes needs to solve the following problem: $$$n$$$ cards with prices for different positions are laid out in front of him, on the $$$i$$$-th card there is an integer $$$a_i$$$, among these prices there is no whole positive integer $$$x$$$.Kmes is asked to divide these cards into the minimum number ofbadsegments (so that each card belongs to exactly one segment). A segment is consideredbadif it is impossible to select a subset of cards with a product equal to $$$x$$$. All segments, in which Kmes will divide the cards, must bebad.Formally, the segment $$$(l, r)$$$ isbadif there are no indices $$$i_1 < i_2 < \\\\ldots < i_k$$$ such that $$$l \\\\le i_1, i_k \\\\le r$$$, and $$$a_{i_1} \\\\cdot a_{i_2} \\\\ldots \\\\cdot a_{i_k} = x$$$.Help Kmes determine the minimum number ofbadsegments in order to enjoy his favorite dish.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each set of input data gives you $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5, 2 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of cards and the integer, respectively.The second line of each set of input data contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5, a_i \\\\neq x$$$) — the prices on the cards.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all sets of test data does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each set of input data, output the minimum number ofbadsegments.ExampleInput86 42 3 6 2 1 29 10000050000 25000 12500 6250 3125 2 4 8 165 21 1 1 1 18 64 3 4 3 4 3 4 37 126 11 1 3 11 10 210 52 4 4 2 4 4 4 3 1 17 84 6 5 1 2 4 18 273 9 17 26 2 20 9 3Output3 2 1 1 2 1 3 3",
