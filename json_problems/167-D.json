They love to build cities and roads.The country used to havekcities, thej-th city (1 ≤j≤k) was located at a point (xj,yj). It was decided to create anothern-kcities. And thei-th one (k<i≤n) was created at a point with coordinates (xi,yi):xi= (a·xi- 1+b)mod(109+ 9)yi= (c·yi- 1+d)mod(109+ 9)Herea,b,c,dare primes. Also,a≠c,b≠d.After the construction of allncities, the wizards have noticed something surprising. It turned out that for every two different citiesiandj,xi≠xjandyi≠yjholds.The cities are built, it's time to build roads! It was decided to use the most difficult (and, of course, the most powerful) spell for the construction of roads. Using this spell creates a road between the towns ofu,v(yu>yv) if and only if for any citywwhich lies strictly inside the corner at the pointu,v(see below), there is a citysthat does not lie in the corner, which is located along thex-coordinate strictly betweenwanduand simultaneouslyys>yv.Acorneron the pointsp2(x2,y2),p1(x1,y1) (y1<y2) is the set of points (x,y), for which at least one of the two conditions is fulfilled:min(x1,x2) ≤x≤max(x1,x2)andy≥y1y1≤y≤y2and(x-x2)·(x1-x2) ≥ 0The pictures showing two different cornersIn order to test the spell, the wizards will apply it to all the cities that lie on thex-coordinate in the interval[L,R]. After the construction of roads the national government wants to choose the maximum number of pairs of cities connected by the road, so that no city occurs in two or more pairs. Your task is for eachmoffered variants of valuesL,Rto calculate the maximum number of such pairs after the construction of the roads. Please note that the cities that do not lie in the interval[L,R]on thex-coordinate, do not affect the construction of roads in any way.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersn,k(1 ≤k≤n≤ 105,k≤ 30). Nextklines contain coordinates of the cities' location points from the first to thek-th one. Thej-th line contains space-separated pair of integersxj,yj(0 ≤xj,yj< 109+ 9) — coordinates of thej-th city.The next line contains space-separated integersa,b,c,d(2 ≤a,b,c,d< 109+ 9). It is guaranteed that those numbers are prime and also thata≠c,b≠d.It's guaranteed, that for every two different citiesiandj,xi≠xjandyi≠yjholds.The next line contains integerm(1 ≤m≤ 105) — the number of variants to build the roads. Nextmlines contain pairs of space-separated integersLi,Ri(0 ≤Li≤Ri< 109+ 9) — the variants of choosing the cities to build the roads.OutputFor any pair of numbersLi,Riprint the answer to the problem on a single line. Print the answers for the pairs in the order, in which the pairs are given in the input data.ExamplesInput6 60 01 12 23 34 45 52 3 3 240 51 42 33 3Output3210Input6 10 03 5 23917 1140 10000000080 10100 150200 10000Output2101NoteIn the first sample the roads connect the cities in a chain in the order of increasing ofx.In the second sample the remaining 5 cities will be located at points(5,  11); (20,  263098); (65,  292514823); (200,  76958738); (605,  622120197).",
