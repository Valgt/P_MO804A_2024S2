Hyperregular Bracket Stringstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ intervals. The $$$i$$$-th interval is $$$[l_i,r_i]$$$ where $$$1 \\\\leq l_i \\\\leq r_i \\\\leq n$$$.Let us call aregularbracket sequence$$$^{\\\\dagger,\\\\ddagger}$$$ of length $$$n$$$hyperregularif for each $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq k$$$, the substring $$$\\\\overline{s_{l_i} s_{l_{i}+1} \\\\ldots s_{r_i}}$$$ is also a regular bracket sequence.Your task is to count the number of hyperregular bracket sequences. Since this number can be really large, you are only required to find it modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ A bracket sequence is a string containing only the characters \"(\" and \")\".$$$^\\\\ddagger$$$ A bracket sequence is called regular if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters+and1. For example, sequences(())(),(),(()(()))and the empty string are regular, while)(,((), and(()))(are not.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the hyperregular bracket sequences and the number of intervals respectively.The following $$$k$$$ lines of each test case contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the number of hyperregular bracket sequences modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.ExampleInput76 05 08 11 310 23 46 91000 3100 701200 801300 90128 51 123 2011 144 918 194 31 41 41 4Output5 0 0 4 839415253 140 2NoteFor the first testcase, the $$$5$$$hyperregular bracket stringsof length $$$6$$$ are:((())),(()()),(())(),()(())and()()().For the second testcase, there are no regular bracket strings of length $$$5$$$, and consequently, there are nohyperregular bracket stringsof length $$$5$$$.For the third testcase, there are no hyperregular bracket strings of length $$$8$$$ for which the substring $$$[1 \\\\ldots 3]$$$ is a regular bracket string.For the fourth testcase, there $$$4$$$hyperregular bracket stringsare:((())(())),((())()()),()()((()))and()()(()())",
