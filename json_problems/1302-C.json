Segment tree or Fenwick?time limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an unusual problem in an unusual contest, here is the announcement:http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/73543You are given an array $$$A$$$ of length $$$n$$$, initially filled with zeros. You need to process $$$q$$$ queries to the array, each of one of the following types:1 x y: you need to assign $$$A_x=y$$$;2 l r: you need to print $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=l}^r A_i$$$.Furthermore, there are $$$T$$$ independent tests you need to process.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case description starts with two integers $$$n, q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, q \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the array and the number of queries. The following $$$q$$$ lines contain the description of queries: $$$1~x~y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x \\\\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\\\leq y \\\\leq 10^9$$$) for queries of the first type and $$$2~l~r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq n$$$) for queries of the second type.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ as well as the sum of $$$q$$$ does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each query of the second type print its result on a separate line.ExampleInput2 6 5 2 1 6 1 3 2 2 2 4 1 6 3 2 1 6 5 3 1 3 7 1 1 4 2 1 5Output0 2 5 11",
