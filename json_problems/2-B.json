You should find such a way on it thatstarts in the upper left cell of the matrix;each following cell is to the right or down from the current cell;the way ends in the bottom right cell.Moreover, if we multiply together all the numbers along the way, the result should be the least \"round\". In other words, it should end in the least possible number of zeros.InputThe first line contains an integer numbern(2 ≤n≤ 1000),nis the size of the matrix. Then follownlines containing the matrix elements (non-negative integer numbers not exceeding109).OutputIn the first line print the least number of trailing zeros. In the second line print the correspondent way itself.ExamplesInput31 2 34 5 67 8 9Output0DDRR",
