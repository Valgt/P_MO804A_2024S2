King of Thievestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn this problem you will meet the simplified model of game King of Thieves.In a new ZeptoLab game called \"King of Thieves\" your aim is to reach a chest with gold by controlling your character, avoiding traps and obstacles on your way.An interesting feature of the game is that you can design your own levels that will be available to other players. Let's consider the following simple design of a level.A dungeon consists ofnsegments located at a same vertical level, each segment is either a platform that character can stand on, or a pit with a trap that makes player lose if he falls into it. All segments have the same length, platforms on the scheme of the level are represented as'*'and pits are represented as'.'.One of things that affects speedrun characteristics of the level is a possibility to perform a series of consecutive jumps of the same length. More formally, when the character is on the platform numberi1, he can make a sequence of jumps through the platformsi1<i2< ... <ik, ifi2-i1=i3-i2= ... =ik-ik- 1. Of course, all segmentsi1,i2, ...ikshould be exactly the platforms, not pits.Let's call a level to begoodif you can perform a sequence offourjumps of the same length or in the other words there must be a sequencei1,i2, ...,i5, consisting offiveplatforms so that the intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length. Given the scheme of the level, check if it is good.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of segments on the level.Next line contains the scheme of the level represented as a string ofncharacters'*'and'.'.OutputIf the level isgood, print the word\"yes\"(without the quotes), otherwise print the word\"no\"(without the quotes).ExamplesInput16.**.*..*.***.**.OutputyesInput11.*.*...*.*.OutputnoNoteIn the first sample test you may perform a sequence of jumps through platforms2, 5, 8, 11, 14.",
