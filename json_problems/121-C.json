Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits4and7. For example, numbers47,744,4are lucky and5,17,467are not.One day Petya dreamt of a lexicographicallyk-th permutation of integers from1ton. Determine how many lucky numbers in the permutation are located on the positions whose indexes are also lucky numbers.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n,k≤ 109)— the number of elements in the permutation and the lexicographical number of the permutation.OutputIf thek-th permutation of numbers from1tondoes not exist, print the single number \"-1\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print the answer to the problem: the number of such indexesi, thatiandaiare both lucky numbers.ExamplesInput7 4Output1Input4 7Output1NoteA permutation is an ordered set ofnelements, where each integer from1tonoccurs exactly once. The element of permutation in position with indexiis denoted asai(1 ≤i≤n). Permutationais lexicographically smaller that permutationbif there is such ai(1 ≤i≤n), thatai<bi, and for anyj(1 ≤j<i)aj=bj. Let's make a list of all possible permutations ofnelements and sort it in the order of lexicographical increasing. Then the lexicographicallyk-th permutation is thek-th element of this list of permutations.In the first sample the permutation looks like that:1 2 3 4 6 7 5The only suitable position is 4.In the second sample the permutation looks like that:2 1 3 4The only suitable position is 4.",
