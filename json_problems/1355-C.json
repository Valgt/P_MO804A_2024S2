Count Trianglestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLike any unknown mathematician, Yuri has favourite numbers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$, and $$$D$$$, where $$$A \\\\leq B \\\\leq C \\\\leq D$$$. Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\\\leq x \\\\leq B \\\\leq y \\\\leq C \\\\leq z \\\\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.InputThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq A \\\\leq B \\\\leq C \\\\leq D \\\\leq 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.OutputPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\\\leq x \\\\leq B \\\\leq y \\\\leq C \\\\leq z \\\\leq D$$$ holds.ExamplesInput1 2 3 4Output4Input1 2 2 5Output3Input500000 500000 500000 500000Output1NoteIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
