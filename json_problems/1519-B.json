    "statement": "B. The Cake Is a Lietime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a $$$n \\\\times m$$$ grid. You are standing at cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ and your goal is to finish at cell $$$(n, m)$$$.You can move to the neighboring cells to the right or down. In other words, suppose you are standing at cell $$$(x, y)$$$. You can:move right to the cell $$$(x, y + 1)$$$ — it costs $$$x$$$ burles;move down to the cell $$$(x + 1, y)$$$ — it costs $$$y$$$ burles.Can you reach cell $$$(n, m)$$$ spendingexactly$$$k$$$ burles?InputThe first line contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 100$$$; $$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the sizes of grid and the exact amount of money you need to spend.OutputFor each test case, if you can reach cell $$$(n, m)$$$ spendingexactly$$$k$$$ burles, printYES. Otherwise, printNO.You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESare all recognized as positive answer).ExampleInput6 1 1 0 2 2 2 2 2 3 2 2 4 1 4 3 100 100 10000OutputYES NO YES NO YES NONoteIn the first test case, you are already in the final cell, so you spend $$$0$$$ burles.In the second, third and fourth test cases, there are two paths from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(2, 2)$$$: $$$(1, 1)$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$(1, 2)$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$(2, 2)$$$ or $$$(1, 1)$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$(2, 1)$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$(2, 2)$$$. Both costs $$$1 + 2 = 3$$$ burles, so it's the only amount of money you can spend.In the fifth test case, there is the only way from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(1, 4)$$$ and it costs $$$1 + 1 + 1 = 3$$$ burles.",
