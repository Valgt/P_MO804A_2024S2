New Year and Permutationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecall that the permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsegment of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. We will denote the subsegments as $$$[l, r]$$$, where $$$l, r$$$ are two integers with $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$. This indicates the subsegment where $$$l-1$$$ elements from the beginning and $$$n-r$$$ elements from the end are deleted from the sequence.For a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$, we define aframed segmentas a subsegment $$$[l,r]$$$ where $$$\\\\max\\\\{p_l, p_{l+1}, \\\\dots, p_r\\\\} - \\\\min\\\\{p_l, p_{l+1}, \\\\dots, p_r\\\\} = r - l$$$. For example, for the permutation $$$(6, 7, 1, 8, 5, 3, 2, 4)$$$ some of its framed segments are: $$$[1, 2], [5, 8], [6, 7], [3, 3], [8, 8]$$$. In particular, a subsegment $$$[i,i]$$$ is always a framed segments for any $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive.We define thehappinessof a permutation $$$p$$$ as the number of pairs $$$(l, r)$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$, and $$$[l, r]$$$ is a framed segment. For example, the permutation $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$ has happiness $$$5$$$: all segments except $$$[1, 2]$$$ are framed segments.Given integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, Jongwon wants to compute the sum of happiness for all permutations of length $$$n$$$, modulo the prime number $$$m$$$. Note that there exist $$$n!$$$ (factorial of $$$n$$$) different permutations of length $$$n$$$.InputThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 250\\\\,000$$$, $$$10^8 \\\\le m \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$m$$$ is prime).OutputPrint $$$r$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le r < m$$$), the sum of happiness for all permutations of length $$$n$$$, modulo a prime number $$$m$$$.ExamplesInput1 993244853Output1Input2 993244853Output6Input3 993244853Output32Input2019 993244853Output923958830Input2020 437122297Output265955509NoteFor sample input $$$n=3$$$, let's consider all permutations of length $$$3$$$:$$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, all subsegments are framed segment. Happiness is $$$6$$$.$$$[1, 3, 2]$$$, all subsegments except $$$[1, 2]$$$ are framed segment. Happiness is $$$5$$$.$$$[2, 1, 3]$$$, all subsegments except $$$[2, 3]$$$ are framed segment. Happiness is $$$5$$$.$$$[2, 3, 1]$$$, all subsegments except $$$[2, 3]$$$ are framed segment. Happiness is $$$5$$$.$$$[3, 1, 2]$$$, all subsegments except $$$[1, 2]$$$ are framed segment. Happiness is $$$5$$$.$$$[3, 2, 1]$$$, all subsegments are framed segment. Happiness is $$$6$$$.Thus, the sum of happiness is $$$6+5+5+5+5+6 = 32$$$.",
