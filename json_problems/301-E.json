He needs to count the number of distinct great arrays. Help Yaroslav! As the answer may be rather large, print the remainder after dividing it by1000000007(109+ 7).Two arrays are considered distinct if there is a position in which they have distinct numbers.InputThe single line contains three integersn,m,k(1 ≤n,m,k≤ 100).OutputIn a single line print the remainder after dividing the answer to the problem by number1000000007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput1 1 1Output0Input3 3 3Output2",
