DZY Loves Stringstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutDZY loves strings, and he enjoys collecting them.In China, many people like to use strings containing their names' initials, for example:xyz,jcvb,dzy,dyh.Once DZY found a lucky strings. A lot of pairs of good friends came to DZY when they heard about the news. The first member of thei-th pair has nameai, the second one has namebi. Each pair wondered if there is a substring of the lucky string containing both of their names. If so, they want to find the one with minimum length, which can give them good luck and make their friendship last forever.Please help DZY for each pair find the minimum length of the substring ofsthat contains bothaiandbi, or point out that such substring doesn't exist.A substring ofsis a stringslsl+ 1...srfor some integersl,r(1 ≤l≤r≤ |s|). The length of such the substring is(r-l+ 1).A stringpcontains some another stringqif there is a substring ofpequal toq.InputThe first line contains a strings(1 ≤ |s| ≤ 50000).The second line contains a non-negative integerq(0 ≤q≤ 100000)— the number of pairs. Each of the nextqlines describes a pair, the line contains two space-separated stringsaiandbi(1 ≤ |ai|, |bi| ≤ 4).It is guaranteed that all the strings only consist of lowercase English letters.OutputFor each pair, print a line containing a single integer — the minimum length of the required substring. If there is no such substring, output-1.ExamplesInputxudyhduxyz3xyz xyzdyh xyzdzy xyzOutput38-1Inputabcabd3a cab abcab dOutput233Inputbaabcabaaa2abca baaaa abaOutput64NoteThe shortest substrings in the first sample are:xyz,dyhduxyz.The shortest substrings in the second sample are:ca,abcandabd.The shortest substrings in the third sample are:baabcaandabaa.",
