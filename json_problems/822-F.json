After vacation in Vičkopolis Noora needs to return to Pavlopolis and continue her study.Sometimes (or quite often) there are teachers who do not like you. Incidentally Noora also has one such teacher. His name is Yury Dmitrievich and he teaches graph theory. Yury Dmitrievich doesn't like Noora, so he always gives the girl the most difficult tasks. So it happened this time.The teacher gives Noora a tree withnvertices. Vertices are numbered with integers from1ton. The length of all the edges of this tree is1. Noora chooses a set of simple paths that pairwise don't intersect in edges. However each vertex should belong to at least one of the selected path.For each of the selected paths, the following is done:We chooseexactlyone edge(u,v)that belongs to the path.On the selected edge(u,v)there is a point at some selected distancexfrom the vertexuand at distance1 -xfrom vertexv. But the distancexchosen by Noora arbitrarily, i. e. it can be different for different edges.One of the verticesuorvis selected. The point will start moving to the selected vertex.Let us explain how the point moves by example. Suppose that the path consists of two edges(v1,v2)and(v2,v3), the point initially stands on the edge(v1,v2)and begins its movement to the vertexv1. Then the point will reachv1, then \"turn around\", because the end of the path was reached, further it will move in another direction to vertexv2, then to vertexv3, then \"turn around\" again, then move tov2and so on. The speed of the points is1edge per second. For example, for0.5second the point moves to the length of the half of an edge.A stopwatch is placed at each vertex of the tree. The time that the stopwatches indicate at start time is0seconds. Then at the starting moment of time, all points simultaneously start moving from the selected positions to selected directions along the selected paths, and stopwatches are simultaneously started. When one of the points reaches the vertexv, the stopwatch at the vertexvis automatically reset, i.e. it starts counting the time from zero.Denote byresvthe maximal time that the stopwatch at the vertexvwill show if the point movement continues infinitely. Noora is asked to select paths and points on them so thatres1is as minimal as possible. If there are several solutions to do this, it is necessary to minimizeres2, thenres3,res4, ...,resn.Help Noora complete the teacher's task.For the better understanding of the statement, see the explanation for the example.InputThe first line contains single integern(2 ≤n≤ 100) — number of vertices in the given tree.Each of nextn- 1lines contains two integersuandv(1 ≤u,v≤n,u≠v) — vertices connected by an edge.Guaranteed that input defines a valid tree.OutputIn the first line print single integerpaths— number of paths you want to choose.In the nextpathslines print path's descriptions:Single integerlen— number of edges in the current path.lenintegers — indices of the edges in the path. The edges are numbered from1ton- 1in order they are given in input.Two integersuandv— means that you put point on the edge between verticesuandv(obviously the edge should belong to the path) and a point will start moving to the vertexv. Note thatorder of printing of the edge's ends is important. For example if you print \"1 2\" (without quotes), then point will start moving to vertex2; but if you print \"2 1\" (without quotes), then point will start moving to vertex1.Single real numberx(0 ≤x≤ 1) — distance between point and vertexu(the same vertex that you print first in the third paragraph).ScoringJudge system will generate arrayresusing the output data provided by the participant.
