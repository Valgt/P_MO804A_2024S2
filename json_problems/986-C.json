Let's build an undirected graph on these integers in the following way: connect two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ with an edge if and only if $$$x \\\\& y = 0$$$. Here $$$\\\\&$$$ is thebitwise AND operation. Count the number of connected components in that graph.InputIn the first line of input there are two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le n \\\\le 22$$$, $$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 2^{n}$$$).In the second line there are $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_m$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_{i} < 2^{n}$$$) — the elements of the set.
