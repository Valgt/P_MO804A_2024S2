Physical Education Lessontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual, everyone was lined up and asked to settle in \"the first–$$$k$$$-th\" position.As is known, settling in \"the first–$$$k$$$-th\" position occurs as follows: the first $$$k$$$ people have numbers $$$1, 2, 3, \\\\ldots, k$$$, the next $$$k - 2$$$ people have numbers $$$k - 1, k - 2, \\\\ldots, 2$$$, the next $$$k$$$ people have numbers $$$1, 2, 3, \\\\ldots, k$$$, and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every $$$2k - 2$$$ positions. Examples of settling are given in the \"Note\" section.The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number $$$k$$$ described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how many natural numbers $$$k$$$ fit under the given constraints.Note that the settling exists if and only if $$$k > 1$$$. In particular, this means that the settlingdoes not existfor $$$k = 1$$$.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x < n \\\\le 10^9$$$) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of different $$$k$$$ that fit under the given constraints.It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.ExampleInput510 23 176 4100 991000000000 500000000Output4 1 9 0 1NoteIn the first test case, $$$k$$$ equals $$$2, 3, 5, 6$$$ are suitable.An example of settling for these $$$k$$$:$$$k$$$ / №$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$3$$$$$$4$$$$$$5$$$$$$6$$$$$$7$$$$$$8$$$$$$9$$$$$$10$$$$$$2$$$$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$3$$$$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$3$$$$$$2$$$$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$3$$$$$$2$$$$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$5$$$$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$3$$$$$$4$$$$$$5$$$$$$4$$$$$$3$$$$$$2$$$$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$6$$$$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$3$$$$$$4$$$$$$5$$$$$$6$$$$$$5$$$$$$4$$$$$$3$$$$$$2$$$In the second test case, $$$k = 2$$$ is suitable.",
