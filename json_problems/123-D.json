Each pair of numberslandrthat fulfill the condition1 ≤l≤r≤ |s|, correspond to a substring of the strings, starting in the positionland ending in the positionr(inclusive).Let's define the function of two stringsF(x,y)like this. We'll find a list of such pairs of numbers for which the corresponding substrings of stringxare equal to stringy. Let's sort this list of pairs according to the pair's first number's increasing. The value of functionF(x,y)equals the number of non-empty continuous sequences in the list.For example:F(babbabbababbab,babb) = 6. The list of pairs is as follows:(1, 4), (4, 7), (9, 12)Its continuous sequences are:(1, 4)(4, 7)(9, 12)(1, 4), (4, 7)(4, 7), (9, 12)(1, 4), (4, 7), (9, 12)Your task is to calculate for the given stringsthe sumF(s,x)for allx, thatxbelongs to the set of all substrings of a strings.InputThe only line contains the given strings, consisting only of small Latin letters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105).OutputPrint the single number — the sought sum.Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++.
