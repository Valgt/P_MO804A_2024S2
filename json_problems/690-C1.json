Brain Network (easy)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOne particularly well-known fact about zombies is that they move and think terribly slowly. While we still don't know why their movements are so sluggish, the problem of laggy thinking has been recently resolved. It turns out that the reason is not (as previously suspected) any kind of brain defect – it's the opposite! Independent researchers confirmed that the nervous system of a zombie is highly complicated – it consists ofnbrains (much like a cow has several stomachs). They are interconnected bybrain connectors, which are veins capable of transmitting thoughts between brains. There are two important properties such a brain network should have to function properly:It should be possible to exchange thoughts between any two pairs of brains (perhaps indirectly, through other brains).There should be no redundant brain connectors, that is, removing any brain connector would make property 1 false.If both properties are satisfied, we say that the nervous system isvalid. Unfortunately (?), if the system is not valid, the zombie stops thinking and becomes (even more) dead. Your task is to analyze a given nervous system of a zombie and find out whether it is valid.InputThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 1000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from1ton) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively. In the nextmlines, descriptions of brain connectors follow. Every connector is given as a pair of brainsabit connects (1 ≤a,b≤n,a≠b).OutputThe output consists of one line, containing eitheryesornodepending on whether the nervous system is valid.ExamplesInput4 41 22 33 14 1OutputnoInput6 51 22 33 44 53 6Outputyes",
