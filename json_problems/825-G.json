Initially all vertices are white. You have to processqqueries of two different types:1x— change the color of vertexxto black. It is guaranteed that the first query will be of this type.2x— for the vertexx, find the minimum indexysuch that the vertex with indexybelongs to the simple path fromxto some black vertex (a simple path never visits any vertex more than once).For each query of type2print the answer to it.Note that the queries are given in modified way.InputThe first line contains two numbersnandq(3 ≤n,q≤ 106).Thenn- 1lines follow, each line containing two numbersxiandyi(1 ≤xi<yi≤n) and representing the edge between verticesxiandyi.It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.Thenqlines follow.
