Tramtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe tram in Berland goes along a straight line from the point0to the pointsand back, passing1meter pert1seconds in both directions. It means that the tram is always in the state of uniform rectilinear motion, instantly turning around at pointsx= 0andx=s.Igor is at the pointx1. He should reach the pointx2. Igor passes1meter pert2seconds.Your task is to determine the minimum time Igor needs to get from the pointx1to the pointx2, if it is known where the tram is and in what direction it goes at the moment Igor comes to the pointx1.Igor can enter the tram unlimited number of times at any moment when his and the tram's positions coincide. It isnot obligatorythat points in which Igor enter and exit the tram are integers. Assume that any boarding and unboarding happens instantly. Igor can move arbitrary along the line (but not faster than1meter pert2seconds). He can also stand at some point for some time.InputThe first line contains three integerss,x1andx2(2 ≤s≤ 1000,0 ≤x1,x2≤s,x1≠x2) — the maximum coordinate of the point to which the tram goes, the point Igor is at, and the point he should come to.The second line contains two integerst1andt2(1 ≤t1,t2≤ 1000) — the time in seconds in which the tram passes1meter and the time in seconds in which Igor passes1meter.The third line contains two integerspandd(1 ≤p≤s- 1,dis either1or) — the position of the tram in the moment Igor came to the pointx1and the direction of the tram at this moment. If, the tram goes in the direction from the pointsto the point0. Ifd= 1, the tram goes in the direction from the point0to the points.OutputPrint the minimum time in seconds which Igor needs to get from the pointx1to the pointx2.ExamplesInput4 2 43 41 1Output8Input5 4 01 23 1Output7NoteIn the first example it is profitable for Igor to go by foot and not to wait the tram. Thus, he has to pass2meters and it takes8seconds in total, because he passes1meter per4seconds.In the second example Igor can, for example, go towards the pointx2and get to the point1in6seconds (because he has to pass3meters, but he passes1meters per2seconds). At that moment the tram will be at the point1, so Igor can enter the tram and pass1meter in1second. Thus, Igor will reach the pointx2in7seconds in total.",
