He wants to round it to nearest integer, which ends up with0. Ifnalready ends up with0, Vasya considers it already rounded.For example, ifn= 4722answer is4720. Ifn= 5Vasya can round it to0or to10. Both ways are correct.For givennfind out to which integer will Vasya round it.InputThe first line contains single integern(0 ≤n≤ 109) — number that Vasya has.OutputPrint result of roundingn. Pay attention that in some cases answer isn't unique. In that case print any correct answer.ExamplesInput5Output0Input113Output110Input1000000000Output1000000000Input5432359Output5432360NoteIn the first examplen= 5. Nearest integers, that ends up with zero are0and10. Any of these answers is correct, so you can print0or10.",
