Each vertex of the tree has some color. We will assume that the tree vertices are numbered by integers from 1 ton. Then we represent the color of vertexvascv. The tree root is a vertex with number 1.In this problem you need to answer tomqueries. Each query is described by two integersvj,kj. The answer to queryvj,kjis the number of such colors of verticesx, that the subtree of vertexvjcontains at leastkjvertices of colorx.You can find the definition of a rooted tree by the following link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory).InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(2 ≤n≤ 105; 1 ≤m≤ 105). The next line contains a sequence of integersc1,c2, ...,cn(1 ≤ci≤ 105). The nextn- 1lines contain the edges of the tree. Thei-th line contains the numbersai,bi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n;ai≠bi)— the vertices connected by an edge of the tree.Nextmlines contain the queries. Thej-th line contains two integersvj,kj(1 ≤vj≤n; 1 ≤kj≤ 105).OutputPrintmintegers — the answers to the queries in the order the queries appear in the input.ExamplesInput8 51 2 2 3 3 2 3 31 21 52 32 45 65 75 81 21 31 42 35 3Output22101Input4 11 2 3 41 22 33 41 1Output4NoteA subtree of vertexvin a rooted tree with rootris a set of vertices{u:dist(r,v) +dist(v,u) =dist(r,u)}.
