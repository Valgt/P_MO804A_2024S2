Declined Finaliststime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis year, as in previous years, MemSQL is inviting the top 25 competitors from the Start[c]up qualification round to compete onsite for the final round. Not everyone who is eligible to compete onsite can afford to travel to the office, though. Initially the top 25 contestants are invited to come onsite. Each eligible contestant must either accept or decline the invitation. Whenever a contestant declines, the highest ranked contestant not yet invited is invited to take the place of the one that declined. This continues until 25 contestants have accepted invitations.After the qualifying round completes, you knowKof the onsite finalists, as well as their qualifying ranks (which start at1, there are no ties). Determine the minimum possible number of contestants that declined the invitation to compete onsite in the final round.InputThe first line of input containsK(1 ≤K≤ 25), the number of onsite finalists you know. The second line of input containsr1,r2, ...,rK(1 ≤ri≤ 106), the qualifying ranks of the finalists you know. All these ranks are distinct.OutputPrint the minimum possible number of contestants that declined the invitation to compete onsite.ExamplesInput252 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 28Output3Input516 23 8 15 4Output0Input314 15 92Output67NoteIn the first example, you know all 25 onsite finalists.
