Splittable Permutationstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputInitially, we had one array, which was a permutation of size $$$n$$$ (an array of size $$$n$$$ where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once).We performed $$$q$$$ operations. During the $$$i$$$-th operation, we did the following:choose any array we have with at least $$$2$$$ elements;split it into two non-empty arrays (prefix and suffix);write two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$, where $$$l_i$$$ is the maximum element in the left part which we get after the split, and $$$r_i$$$ is the maximum element in the right part;remove the array we've chosen from the pool of arrays we can use, and add the two resulting parts into the pool.For example, suppose the initial array was $$$[6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5]$$$, and we performed the following operations:choose the array $$$[6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5]$$$ and split it into $$$[6, 3]$$$ and $$$[4, 1, 2, 5]$$$. Then we write $$$l_1 = 6$$$ and $$$r_1 = 5$$$, and the arrays we have are $$$[6, 3]$$$ and $$$[4, 1, 2, 5]$$$;choose the array $$$[4, 1, 2, 5]$$$ and split it into $$$[4, 1, 2]$$$ and $$$[5]$$$. Then we write $$$l_2 = 4$$$ and $$$r_2 = 5$$$, and the arrays we have are $$$[6, 3]$$$, $$$[4, 1, 2]$$$ and $$$[5]$$$;choose the array $$$[4, 1, 2]$$$ and split it into $$$[4]$$$ and $$$[1, 2]$$$. Then we write $$$l_3 = 4$$$ and $$$r_3 = 2$$$, and the arrays we have are $$$[6, 3]$$$, $$$[4]$$$, $$$[1, 2]$$$ and $$$[5]$$$.You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$, and two sequences $$$[l_1, l_2, \\\\dots, l_q]$$$ and $$$[r_1, r_2, \\\\dots, r_q]$$$. A permutation of size $$$n$$$ is calledvalidif we can perform $$$q$$$ operations and produce the given sequences $$$[l_1, l_2, \\\\dots, l_q]$$$ and $$$[r_1, r_2, \\\\dots, r_q]$$$.Calculate the number of valid permutations.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q < n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$l_1, l_2, \\\\dots, l_q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le n$$$).The third line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \\\\dots, r_q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le r_i \\\\le n$$$).Additional constraint on the input: there exists at least one permutation which can produce the given sequences $$$[l_1, l_2, \\\\dots, l_q]$$$ and $$$[r_1, r_2, \\\\dots, r_q]$$$.OutputPrint one integer â€” the number of valid permutations, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExamplesInput6 36 4 45 5 2Output30Input10 1109Output1814400Input4 124Output8",
