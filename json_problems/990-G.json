A number is written on each vertex; the number on vertex $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$a_i$$$.Let's denote the function $$$g(x, y)$$$ as the greatest common divisor of the numbers written on the vertices belonging to the simple path from vertex $$$x$$$ to vertex $$$y$$$ (including these two vertices).For every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ you have to count the number of pairs $$$(x, y)$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le x \\\\le y \\\\le n)$$$ such that $$$g(x, y)$$$ is equal to this number.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ — the number of vertices $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5)$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5)$$$ — the numbers written on vertices.Then $$$n - 1$$$ lines follow, each containing two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le x, y \\\\le n, x \\\\ne y)$$$ denoting an edge connecting vertex $$$x$$$ with vertex $$$y$$$. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.OutputFor every integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ do the following: if there is no pair $$$(x, y)$$$ such that $$$x \\\\le y$$$ and $$$g(x, y) = i$$$, don't output anything. Otherwise output two integers: $$$i$$$ and the number of aforementioned pairs. You have to consider the values of $$$i$$$ in ascending order.See the examples for better understanding.ExamplesInput31 2 31 22 3Output1 42 13 1Input61 2 4 8 16 321 66 33 44 26 5Output1 62 54 68 116 232 1Input49 16 144 61 32 34 3Output1 12 13 16 29 216 2144 1",
