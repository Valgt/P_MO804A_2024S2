You are given positive integerlenand arrayawhich consists ofnintegersa1,a2, ...,an. Let's introduce two characteristics for the given array.Let's consider an arbitrary interval of the array with lengthlen, starting in positioni. Value, is themodular sumon the chosen interval. In other words, the modular sum is the sum of integers on the chosen interval with lengthlen, taken in its absolute value.Valueis theoptimal sumof the array. In other words, the optimal sum of an array is the maximum of all modular sums on various intervals of array with lengthlen.Your task is to calculate the optimal sum of the given arraya. However, before you do the calculations, you are allowed to produceno morethankconsecutive operations of the following form with this array: one operation means taking an arbitrary number from arrayaiand multiply it by -1. In other words, no more thanktimes you are allowed to take an arbitrary numberaifrom the array and replace it with-ai. Each number of the array is allowed to choose an arbitrary number of times.Your task is to calculate the maximum possible optimal sum of the array after at mostkoperations described above are completed.InputThe first line contains two integersn,len(1 ≤len≤n≤ 105) — the number of elements in the array and the length of the chosen subinterval of the array, correspondingly.The second line contains a sequence consisting ofnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(|ai| ≤ 109)— the original array.The third line contains a single integerk(0 ≤k≤n) — the maximum allowed number of operations.All numbers in lines are separated by a single space.OutputIn a single line print the maximum possible optimal sum after no more thankacceptable operations are fulfilled.Please do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to usecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.ExamplesInput5 30 -2 3 -5 12Output10Input5 21 -3 -10 4 13Output14Input3 3-2 -5 41Output11",
