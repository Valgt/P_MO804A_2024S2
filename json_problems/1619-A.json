For example, the strings \"aa\", \"abcabc\", \"abab\" and \"baabaa\" are square. But the strings \"aaa\", \"abaaab\" and \"abcdabc\" are not square.For a given string $$$s$$$ determine if it is square.InputThe first line of input data contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) —the number of test cases.This is followed by $$$t$$$ lines, each containing a description of one test case. The given strings consist only of lowercase Latin letters and have lengths between $$$1$$$ and $$$100$$$ inclusive.OutputFor each test case, output on a separate line:YESif the string in the corresponding test case is square,NOotherwise.You can outputYESandNOin any case (for example, stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput10 a aa aaa aaaa abab abcabc abacaba xxyy xyyx xyxyOutputNO YES NO YES YES YES NO NO NO YES",
