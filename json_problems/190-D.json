To drive the enemy from their native land, the berlanders need to know exactly how many more flatland soldiers are left in the enemy's reserve. Fortunately, the scouts captured an enemy in the morning, who had a secret encrypted message with the information the berlanders needed so much.The captured enemy had an array of positive integers. Berland intelligence have long been aware of the flatland code: to convey the message, which contained a numberm, the enemies use an array of integersa. The number of its subarrays, in which there are at leastkequal numbers, equalsm. The numberkhas long been known in the Berland army so General Touristov has once again asked Corporal Vasya to perform a simple task: to decipher the flatlanders' message.Help Vasya, given an array of integersaand numberk, find the number of subarrays of the array of numbersa, which has at leastkequal numbers.Subarraya[i...j] (1 ≤i≤j≤n)of arraya= (a1,a2, ...,an)is an array, made from its consecutive elements, starting from thei-th one and ending with thej-th one:a[i...j] = (ai,ai+ 1, ...,aj).InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersn,k(1 ≤k≤n≤ 4·105), showing how many numbers an array has and how many equal numbers the subarrays are required to have, correspondingly.The second line containsnspace-separated integersai(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — elements of the array.OutputPrint the single number — the number of such subarrays of arraya, that they have at leastkequal integers.Please do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. In is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.ExamplesInput4 21 2 1 2Output3Input5 31 2 1 1 3Output2Input3 11 1 1Output6NoteIn the first sample are three subarrays, containing at least two equal numbers: (1,2,1), (2,1,2) and (1,2,1,2).In the second sample are two subarrays, containing three equal numbers: (1,2,1,1,3) and (1,2,1,1).In the third sample any subarray contains at least one 1 number. Overall they are 6: (1), (1), (1), (1,1), (1,1) and (1,1,1).",
