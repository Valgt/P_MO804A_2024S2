    "statement": "A. Morning Sandwichtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp always starts his morning with a good ol' sandwich. Sandwiches Monocarp makes always consist of bread, cheese and/or ham.A sandwich always follows the formula:a piece of breada slice of cheese or hama piece of bread$$$\\\\dots$$$a slice of cheese or hama piece of breadSo it always has bread on top and at the bottom, and it alternates between bread and filling, where filling is a slice of either cheese or ham. Each piece of bread and each slice of cheese or ham is called a layer.Today Monocarp woke up and discovered that he has $$$b$$$ pieces of bread, $$$c$$$ slices of cheese and $$$h$$$ slices of ham. What is the maximum number of layers his morning sandwich can have?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases.Each testcase consists of three integers $$$b, c$$$ and $$$h$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le b \\\\le 100$$$; $$$1 \\\\le c, h \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of pieces of bread, slices of cheese and slices of ham, respectively.OutputFor each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum number of layers Monocarp's morning sandwich can have.ExampleInput32 1 110 1 23 7 8Output3 7 5NoteIn the first testcase, Monocarp can arrange a sandwich with three layers: either a piece of bread, a slice of cheese and another piece of bread, or a piece of bread, a slice of ham and another piece of bread.In the second testcase, Monocarp has a lot of bread, but not too much filling. He can arrange a sandwich with four pieces of bread, one slice of cheese and two slices of ham.In the third testcase, it's the opposite — Monocarp has a lot of filling, but not too much bread. He can arrange a sandwich with three pieces of bread and two slices of cheese, for example.",
