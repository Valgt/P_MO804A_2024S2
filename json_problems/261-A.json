    "statement": "A. Maxim and Discountstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutMaxim always goes to the supermarket on Sundays. Today the supermarket has a special offer of discount systems.There aremtypes of discounts. We assume that the discounts are indexed from 1 tom. To use the discount numberi, the customer takes a special basket, where he puts exactlyqiitems he buys. Under the terms of the discount system, in addition to the items in the cart the customer can receive at most two items from the supermarket for free. The number of the \"free items\" (0, 1 or 2) to give is selected by the customer. The only condition imposed on the selected \"free items\" is as follows: each of them mustn't be more expensive than the cheapest item out of theqiitems in the cart.Maxim now needs to buynitems in the shop. Count the minimum sum of money that Maxim needs to buy them, if he use the discount system optimally well.Please assume that the supermarket has enough carts for any actions. Maxim can use the same discount multiple times. Of course, Maxim can buy items without any discounts.InputThe first line contains integerm(1 ≤m≤ 105)— the number of discount types. The second line containsmintegers:q1,q2, ...,qm(1 ≤qi≤ 105).The third line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105)— the number of items Maxim needs. The fourth line containsnintegers:a1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 104)— the items' prices.The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.OutputIn a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput12450 50 100 100Output200Input22 3550 50 50 50 50Output150Input1171 1 1 1 1 1 1Output3NoteIn the first sample Maxim needs to buy two items that cost100and get a discount for two free items that cost50. In that case, Maxim is going to pay200.In the second sample the best strategy for Maxim is to buy3items and get2items for free using the discount. In that case, Maxim is going to pay150.",
