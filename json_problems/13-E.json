This is a game for one person with following rules:There areNholes located in a single row and numbered from left to right with numbers from 1 toN. Each hole has it's own power (hole numberihas the powerai). If you throw a ball into holeiit will immediately jump to holei+ai, then it will jump out of it and so on. If there is no hole with such number, the ball will just jump out of the row. On each of theMmoves the player can perform one of two actions:Set the power of the holeato valueb.Throw a ball into the holeaand count the number of jumps of a ball before it jump out of the row and also write down the number of the hole from which it jumped out just before leaving the row.Petya is not good at math, so, as you have already guessed, you are to perform all computations.InputThe first line contains two integersNandM(1 ≤N≤ 105,1 ≤M≤ 105) — the number of holes in a row and the number of moves. The second line containsNpositive integers not exceedingN— initial values of holes power. The followingMlines describe moves made by Petya. Each of these line can be one of the two types:0ab1aType0means that it is required to set the power of holeatob, and type1means that it is required to throw a ball into thea-th hole. Numbersaandbare positive integers do not exceedingN.OutputFor each move of the type1output two space-separated numbers on a separate line — the number of the last hole the ball visited before leaving the row and the number of jumps it made.ExamplesInput8 51 1 1 1 1 2 8 21 10 1 31 10 3 41 2Output8 78 57 3",
