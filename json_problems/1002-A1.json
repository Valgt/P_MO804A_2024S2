Generate superposition of all basis statestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are givenNqubits (1 ≤N≤ 8) in zero state.Your task is to generate an equal superposition of all2Nbasis vectors onNqubits:For example,forN= 1, the required state is simply,forN= 2, the required state is.You have to implement an operation which takes an array ofNqubits as an input and has no output. The \"output\" of the operation is the state in which it leaves the qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : (){body{// your code here}}}",
