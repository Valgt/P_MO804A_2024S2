    "statement": "F2. Court Blue (Hard Version)time limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the hard version of the problem. In this version, it is not guaranteed that $$$n=m$$$, and the time limit is higher. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.In the court of the Blue King, Lelle and Flamm are having a performance match. The match consists of several rounds. In each round, either Lelle or Flamm wins.Let $$$W_L$$$ and $$$W_F$$$ denote the number of wins of Lelle and Flamm, respectively. The Blue King considers a match to besuccessfulif and only if:after every round, $$$\\\\gcd(W_L,W_F)\\\\le 1$$$;at the end of the match, $$$W_L\\\\le n, W_F\\\\le m$$$.Note that $$$\\\\gcd(0,x)=\\\\gcd(x,0)=x$$$ for every non-negative integer $$$x$$$.Lelle and Flamm can decide to stop the match whenever they want, and the final score of the performance is $$$l \\\\cdot W_L + f \\\\cdot W_F$$$.Please help Lelle and Flamm coordinate their wins and losses such that the performance issuccessful, and the total score of the performance is maximized.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$l$$$, $$$f$$$ ($$$2\\\\leq n\\\\leq m \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot 10^7$$$, $$$1\\\\leq l,f \\\\leq 10^9$$$): $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ give the upper bound on the number of Lelle and Flamm's wins, $$$l$$$ and $$$f$$$ determine the final score of the performance.Unusual additional constraint: it is guaranteed that, for each test, there are no pairs of test cases with the same pair of $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total score of asuccessfulperformance.ExamplesInput83 4 2 54 4 1 46 6 2 27 9 2 38 9 9 12 7 1 45 9 1 45 6 6 7Output22 17 18 37 77 30 41 59Input23082823 20000000 1341 33120000000 20000000 3 5Output10754065643 159999991Input1139 1293 193 412Output559543NoteIn the first test case, a possible performance is as follows:Flamm wins, $$$\\\\gcd(0,1)=1$$$.Lelle wins, $$$\\\\gcd(1,1)=1$$$.Flamm wins, $$$\\\\gcd(1,2)=1$$$.Flamm wins, $$$\\\\gcd(1,3)=1$$$.Flamm wins, $$$\\\\gcd(1,4)=1$$$.Lelle and Flamm agree to stop the match.The final score is $$$1\\\\cdot2+4\\\\cdot5=22$$$.",
