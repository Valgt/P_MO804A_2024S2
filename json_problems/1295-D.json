Calculate the number of integers $$$x$$$ such that $$$0 \\\\le x < m$$$ and $$$\\\\gcd(a, m) = \\\\gcd(a + x, m)$$$.Note: $$$\\\\gcd(a, b)$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.InputThe first line contains the single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 50$$$) — the number of test cases.Next $$$T$$$ lines contain test cases — one per line. Each line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a < m \\\\le 10^{10}$$$).OutputPrint $$$T$$$ integers — one per test case.
