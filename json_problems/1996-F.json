Initially, your score is $$$0$$$. In one operation, you can choose an integer $$$i$$$ and add $$$a_i$$$ to your score. Then, you must set $$$a_i$$$ = $$$\\\\max(0, a_i - b_i)$$$.You only have time to perform $$$k$$$ operations before Sparkle sets off a nuclear bomb! What is the maximum score you can acquire after $$$k$$$ operations?InputThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5, 1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the arrays and the number of operations you can perform.The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, ... a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$).The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, ... b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq b_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output an integer, the maximum score you can acquire after $$$k$$$ operations.ExampleInput53 45 6 72 3 45 932 52 68 64 1418 14 53 24 85 10001 2 3 4 55 4 3 2 11 10000001000000110 63 3 5 10 6 8 6 8 7 76 1 7 4 1 1 8 9 3 1Output21 349 27 500000500000 47",
