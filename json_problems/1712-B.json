Woeful Permutationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputI wonder, does the falling rainForever yearn for it's disdain?Effluvium of the MindYou are given a positive integer $$$n$$$.Find any permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that the sum $$$\\\\operatorname{lcm}(1,p_1) + \\\\operatorname{lcm}(2, p_2) + \\\\ldots + \\\\operatorname{lcm}(n, p_n)$$$ is as large as possible.Here $$$\\\\operatorname{lcm}(x, y)$$$ denotes theleast common multiple (LCM)of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1\\\\,000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The only line for each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, $$$\\\\ldots$$$, $$$p_n$$$ — the permutation with the maximum possible value of $$$\\\\operatorname{lcm}(1,p_1) + \\\\operatorname{lcm}(2, p_2) + \\\\ldots + \\\\operatorname{lcm}(n, p_n)$$$.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExampleInput212Output1  2 1NoteFor $$$n = 1$$$, there is only one permutation, so the answer is $$$[1]$$$.For $$$n = 2$$$, there are two permutations:$$$[1, 2]$$$ — the sum is $$$\\\\operatorname{lcm}(1,1) + \\\\operatorname{lcm}(2, 2) = 1 + 2 = 3$$$.$$$[2, 1]$$$ — the sum is $$$\\\\operatorname{lcm}(1,2) + \\\\operatorname{lcm}(2, 1) = 2 + 2 = 4$$$.",
