You are given two rational numbers, one is represented asand the other one is represented as a finite fraction of heightn. Check if they are equal.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersp,q(1 ≤q≤p≤ 1018)— the numerator and the denominator of the first fraction.The second line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 90)— the height of the second fraction. The third line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 1018)— the continued fraction.Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++.
