Volatile Kitetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a convex polygonPwithndistinct verticesp1,p2, ...,pn. Vertexpihas coordinates(xi,yi)in the 2D plane. These vertices are listed in clockwise order.You can choose a real numberDand move each vertex of the polygon a distance of at mostDfrom their original positions.Find the maximum value ofDsuch that no matter how you move the vertices, the polygon does not intersect itself and stays convex.InputThe first line has one integern(4 ≤n≤ 1 000) — the number of vertices.The nextnlines contain the coordinates of the vertices. Lineicontains two integersxiandyi(- 109≤xi,yi≤ 109) — the coordinates of thei-th vertex. These points are guaranteed to be given in clockwise order, and will form a strictly convex polygon (in particular, no three consecutive points lie on the same straight line).OutputPrint one real numberD, which is the maximum real number such that no matter how you move the vertices, the polygon stays convex.Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed10- 6.Namely, let's assume that your answer isaand the answer of the jury isb. The checker program will consider your answer correct if.ExamplesInput40 00 11 11 0Output0.3535533906Input65 010 012 -410 -85 -83 -4Output1.0000000000NoteHere is a picture of the first sampleHere is an example of making the polygon non-convex.This is not an optimal solution, since the maximum distance we moved one point is≈ 0.4242640687, whereas we can make it non-convex by only moving each point a distance of at most≈ 0.3535533906.",
