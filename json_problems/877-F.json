Ann and Bookstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn Ann's favorite book shop are as many asnbooks on math and economics. Books are numbered from1ton. Each of them contains non-negative number of problems.Today there is a sale: any subsegment of a segment fromltorcan be bought at a fixed price.Ann decided that she wants to buy such non-empty subsegment that the sale operates on it and the number of math problems is greater than the number of economics problemsexactlybyk. Note thatkmay be positive, negative or zero.Unfortunately, Ann is not sure on which segment the sale operates, but she hasqassumptions. For each of them she wants to know the number of options to buy a subsegment satisfying the condition (because the time she spends on choosing depends on that).Currently Ann is too busy solving other problems, she asks you for help. For each her assumption determine the number of subsegments of the given segment such that the number of math problems is greaten than the number of economics problems on that subsegment exactly byk.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 100 000,- 109≤k≤ 109) — the number of books and the needed difference between the number of math problems and the number of economics problems.The second line containsnintegerst1,t2, ...,tn(1 ≤ti≤ 2), wheretiis1if thei-th book is on math or2if thei-th is on economics.The third line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤ 109), whereaiis the number of problems in thei-th book.The fourth line contains a single integerq(1 ≤q≤ 100 000) — the number of assumptions.Each of the nextqlines contains two integersliandri(1 ≤li≤ri≤n) describing thei-th Ann's assumption.OutputPrintqlines, in thei-th of them print the number of subsegments for thei-th Ann's assumption.ExamplesInput4 11 1 1 21 1 1 141 21 31 43 4Output2341Input4 01 2 1 20 0 0 011 4Output10NoteIn the first sample Ann can buy subsegments[1;1], [2;2], [3;3], [2;4]if they fall into the sales segment, because the number of math problems is greater by1on them that the number of economics problems. So we should count for each assumption the number of these subsegments that are subsegments of the given segment.Segments[1;1]and[2;2]are subsegments of[1;2].Segments[1;1], [2;2]and[3;3]are subsegments of[1;3].Segments[1;1], [2;2], [3;3], [2;4]are subsegments of[1;4].Segment[3;3]is subsegment of[3;4].",
