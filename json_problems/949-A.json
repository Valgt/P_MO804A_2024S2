    "statement": "A. Zebrastime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOleg writes down the history of the days he lived. For each day he decides if it was good or bad. Oleg calls a non-empty sequence of days azebra, if it starts with a bad day, ends with a bad day, and good and bad days are alternating in it. Let us denote bad days as0and good days as1. Then, for example, sequences of days0,010,01010are zebras, while sequences1,0110,0101are not.Oleg tells you the story of days he lived in chronological order in form of string consisting of0and1. Now you are interested if it is possible to divide Oleg's life history into severalsubsequences, each of which is a zebra, and the way it can be done. Each day must belong to exactly one of the subsequences. For each of the subsequences, days forming it must be ordered chronologically. Note that subsequence does not have to be a group of consecutive days.InputIn the only line of input data there is a non-empty stringsconsisting of characters0and1, which describes the history of Oleg's life. Its length (denoted as|s|) does not exceed200 000characters.OutputIf there is a way to divide history into zebra subsequences, in the first line of output you should print an integerk(1 ≤k≤ |s|), the resulting number of subsequences. In thei-th of followingklines first print the integerli(1 ≤li≤ |s|), which is the length of thei-th subsequence, and thenliindices of days forming the subsequence. Indices must follow in ascending order. Days are numbered starting from 1. Each index from1tonmust belong to exactly one subsequence. If there is no way to divide day history into zebra subsequences, print-1.Subsequences may be printed in any order. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them. You do not have to minimize nor maximize the value ofk.ExamplesInput0010100Output33 1 3 43 2 5 61 7Input111Output-1",
