King's Problem?time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutEvery true king during his life must conquer the world, hold the Codeforces world finals, win pink panda in the shooting gallery and travel all over his kingdom.King Copa has already done the first three things. Now he just needs to travel all over the kingdom. The kingdom is an infinite plane with Cartesian coordinate system on it. Every city is a point on this plane. There arencities in the kingdom at points with coordinates(x1, 0), (x2, 0), ..., (xn, 0), and there is one city at point(xn+ 1,yn+ 1).King starts his journey in the city numberk. Your task is to find such route for the king, which visits all cities (in any order) and has minimum possible length. It is allowed to visit a city twice. The king can end his journey in any city. Between any pair of cities there is a direct road with length equal to the distance between the corresponding points. No two cities may be located at the same point.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 105, 1 ≤k≤n+ 1) — amount of cities and index of the starting city. The second line containsn+ 1numbersxi. The third line containsyn+ 1. All coordinates are integers and do not exceed106by absolute value. No two cities coincide.OutputOutput the minimum possible length of the journey. Your answer must have relative or absolute error less than10- 6.ExamplesInput3 10 1 2 11Output3.41421356237309490000Input3 11 0 2 11Output3.82842712474619030000Input4 50 5 -1 -5 23Output14.24264068711928400000",
