Distance in Treetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutAtreeis a connected graph that doesn't contain any cycles.Thedistancebetween two vertices of a tree is the length (in edges) of the shortest path between these vertices.You are given a tree withnvertices and a positive numberk. Find the number of distinct pairs of the vertices which have a distance of exactlykbetween them. Note that pairs (v,u) and (u,v) are considered to be the same pair.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 50000,1 ≤k≤ 500) — the number of vertices and the required distance between the vertices.Nextn- 1lines describe the edges as \"aibi\" (without the quotes) (1 ≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi), whereaiandbiare the vertices connected by thei-th edge. All given edges are different.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of distinct pairs of the tree's vertices which have a distance of exactlykbetween them.Please do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.ExamplesInput5 21 22 33 42 5Output4Input5 31 22 33 44 5Output2NoteIn the first sample the pairs of vertexes at distance 2 from each other are (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 5) and (2, 4).",
