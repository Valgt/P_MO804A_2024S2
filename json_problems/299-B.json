Ksusha the Squirreltime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutKsusha the Squirrel is standing at the beginning of a straight road, divided intonsectors. The sectors are numbered 1 ton, from left to right. Initially, Ksusha stands in sector 1.Ksusha wants to walk to the end of the road, that is, get to sectorn. Unfortunately, there are some rocks on the road. We know that Ksusha hates rocks, so she doesn't want to stand in sectors that have rocks.Ksusha the squirrel keeps fit. She can jump from sectorito any of the sectorsi+ 1,i+ 2, ...,i+k.Help Ksusha! Given the road description, say if she can reach the end of the road (note, she cannot stand on a rock)?InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(2 ≤n≤ 3·105, 1 ≤k≤ 3·105). The next line containsncharacters — the description of the road: thei-th character equals \".\", if thei-th sector contains no rocks.
