This language is so peculiar and complicated.The language is that peculiar as it has exactly one variable, calledx. Also, there are two operations:Operation++increases the value of variablexby 1.Operation--decreases the value of variablexby 1.A statement in language Bit++ is a sequence, consisting of exactly one operation and one variablex. The statement is written without spaces, that is, it can only contain characters \"+\", \"-\", \"X\". Executing a statement means applying the operation it contains.A programme in Bit++ is a sequence of statements, each of them needs to be executed. Executing a programme means executing all the statements it contains.You're given a programme in language Bit++. The initial value ofxis0. Execute the programme and find its final value (the value of the variable when this programme is executed).InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 150)— the number of statements in the programme.Nextnlines contain a statement each. Each statement contains exactly one operation (++or--) and exactly one variablex(denoted as letter «X»). Thus, there are no empty statements. The operation and the variable can be written in any order.OutputPrint a single integer — the final value ofx.ExamplesInput1++XOutput1Input2X++--XOutput0",
