    "statement": "F. Lisa and the Martianstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLisa was kidnapped by martians! It okay, because she has watched a lot of TV shows about aliens, so she knows what awaits her. Let's call integermartianif it isa non-negative integerandstrictly less than$$$2^k$$$, for example, when $$$k = 12$$$, the numbers $$$51$$$, $$$1960$$$, $$$0$$$ aremartian, and the numbers $$$\\\\pi$$$, $$$-1$$$, $$$\\\\frac{21}{8}$$$, $$$4096$$$ are not.The aliens will give Lisa $$$n$$$martiannumbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$. Then they will ask her to name anymartiannumber $$$x$$$. After that, Lisa will select a pair of numbers $$$a_i, a_j$$$ ($$$i \\\\neq j$$$) in the given sequence and count $$$(a_i \\\\oplus x) \\\\& (a_j \\\\oplus x)$$$. The operation $$$\\\\oplus$$$ meansBitwise exclusive OR, the operation $$$\\\\&$$$ meansBitwise And. For example, $$$(5 \\\\oplus 17) \\\\& (23 \\\\oplus 17) = (00101_2 \\\\oplus 10001_2) \\\\& (10111_2 \\\\oplus 10001_2) = 10100_2 \\\\& 00110_2 = 00100_2 = 4$$$.Lisa is sure that the higher the calculated value, the higher her chances of returning home. Help the girl choose such $$$i, j, x$$$ that maximize the calculated value.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — number of testcases.Each testcase is described by two lines.The first line contains integers $$$n, k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 30$$$) — the length of the sequence ofmartiannumbers and the value of $$$k$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i < 2^k$$$) — a sequence ofmartiannumbers.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcasesdoes not exceed$$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print three integers $$$i, j, x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i, j \\\\le n$$$, $$$i \\\\neq j$$$, $$$0 \\\\le x < 2^k$$$). The value of $$$(a_i \\\\oplus x) \\\\& (a_j \\\\oplus x)$$$ should be the maximum possible.If there are several solutions, you can print any one.ExampleInput105 43 9 1 4 133 11 0 16 12144 1580 1024 100 9 134 37 3 0 43 20 0 12 412 29 46 14 9 4 4 4 5 10 22 11 02 411 49 42 11 10 1 6 9 11 0 5Output1 3 14 1 3 0 5 6 4082 2 3 7 1 2 3 1 2 15 4 5 11 1 2 0 1 2 0 2 7 4NoteFirst testcase: $$$(3 \\\\oplus 14) \\\\& (1 \\\\oplus 14) = (0011_2 \\\\oplus 1110_2) \\\\& (0001_2 \\\\oplus 1110_2) = 1101_2 = 1101_2 \\\\& 1111_2 = 1101_2 = 13$$$.Second testcase: $$$(1 \\\\oplus 0) \\\\& (1 \\\\oplus 0) = 1$$$.Third testcase: $$$(9 \\\\oplus 4082) \\\\& (13 \\\\oplus 4082) = 4091$$$.Fourth testcase: $$$(3 \\\\oplus 7) \\\\& (0 \\\\oplus 7) = 4$$$.",
