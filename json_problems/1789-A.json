    "statement": "A. Serval and Mocha's Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMocha likes arrays, and Serval gave her an array consisting of positive integers as a gift.Mocha thinks that for an array of positive integers $$$a$$$, it isgoodiff thegreatest common divisorof all the elements in $$$a$$$ is no more than its length. And for an array of at least $$$2$$$ positive integers, it isbeautifuliff all of its prefixes whose length is no less than $$$2$$$ are good.For example:$$$[3,6]$$$ is not good, because $$$\\\\gcd(3,6)=3$$$ is greater than its length $$$2$$$.$$$[1,2,4]$$$ is both good and beautiful, because all of its prefixes whose length is no less than $$$2$$$, which are $$$[1,2]$$$ and $$$[1,2,4]$$$, are both good.$$$[3,6,1]$$$ is good but not beautiful, because $$$[3,6]$$$ is not good.Now Mocha gives you the gift array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers, and she wants to know whether array $$$a$$$ could become beautiful by reordering the elements in $$$a$$$. It is allowed to keep the array $$$a$$$ unchanged.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t\\\\leq 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\\\leq n\\\\leq 100$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n\\\\leq 10^6$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, printYesif it is possible to reorder the elements in $$$a$$$ to make it beautiful, and printNoif not.You can outputYesandNoin any case (for example, stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput623 631 2 433 6 1315 35 21435 10 35 1451261 227821 143 4171 1941OutputNo Yes Yes No Yes YesNoteIn the first test case, neither $$$[3,6]$$$ nor $$$[6,3]$$$ are beautiful, so it's impossible to obtain a beautiful array by reordering the elements in $$$a$$$.In the second test case, $$$[1,2,4]$$$ is already beautiful. Keeping the array $$$a$$$ unchanged can obtain a beautiful array.",
