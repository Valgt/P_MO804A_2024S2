In one second Yaroslav can swap two neighboring array elements. Now Yaroslav is wondering if he can obtain an array where any two neighboring elements would be distinct in a finite time.Help Yaroslav.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 100)— the number of elements in the array. The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 1000)— the array elements.OutputIn the single line print \"YES\" (without the quotes) if Yaroslav can obtain the array he needs, and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.ExamplesInput11OutputYESInput31 1 2OutputYESInput47 7 7 7OutputNONoteIn the first sample the initial array fits well.In the second sample Yaroslav can get array:1,2,1. He can swap the last and the second last elements to obtain it.In the third sample Yarosav can't get the array he needs.",
