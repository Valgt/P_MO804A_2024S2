Visit of the Greattime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe Great Mushroom King descended to the dwarves, but not everyone managed to see him. Only the few chosen ones could see the King.We know that onlyLCM(k2l+ 1,k2l+ 1+ 1, ...,k2r+ 1)dwarves can see the Great Mushroom King. Numbersk,l,rare chosen by the Great Mushroom King himself in some complicated manner which is unclear to common dwarves.The dwarven historians decided to document all visits of the Great Mushroom King. For each visit the dwarven historians know three integerski,li,ri, chosen by the Great Mushroom King for this visit. They also know a prime numberpi. Help them to count the remainder of dividing the number of dwarves who can see the King, by numberpi, for each visit.InputThe first line contains the single integert(1 ≤t≤ 105)— the number of the King's visits.Each of the followingtinput lines contains four space-separated integerski,li,riandpi(1 ≤ki≤ 106;0 ≤li≤ri≤ 1018; 2 ≤pi≤ 109)— the numbers, chosen by the Great Mushroom King and the prime module, correspondingly.It is guaranteed that for all visits numberpiis prime.Please do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.OutputFor each visit print the answer on a single line — the remainder of dividing the number of the dwarves who can see the King this time, by numberpi. Print the answers for the visits in the order, in which the visits are described in the input.ExamplesInput23 1 10 25 0 4 3Output00NoteWe consider thatLCM(a1,a2, ...,an)represents the least common multiple of numbersa1,a2,...,an.We consider thatx0= 1, for anyx.",
