Friends and Subsequencestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMike and !Mike are old childhood rivals, they are opposite in everything they do, except programming. Today they have a problem they cannot solve on their own, but together (with you) — who knows?Every one of them has an integer sequencesaandbof lengthn. Being given a query of the form of pair of integers(l,r), Mike can instantly tell the value ofwhile !Mike can instantly tell the value of.Now suppose a robot (you!) asks them all possible different queries of pairs of integers(l,r)(1 ≤l≤r≤n)(so he will make exactlyn(n+ 1) / 2queries) and counts how many times their answers coincide, thus for how many pairsis satisfied.How many occasions will the robot count?InputThe first line contains only integern(1 ≤n≤ 200 000).The second line containsninteger numbersa1,a2, ...,an(- 109≤ai≤ 109) — the sequencea.The third line containsninteger numbersb1,b2, ...,bn(- 109≤bi≤ 109) — the sequenceb.OutputPrint the only integer number — the number of occasions the robot will count, thus for how many pairsis satisfied.ExamplesInput61 2 3 2 1 46 7 1 2 3 2Output2Input33 3 31 1 1Output0NoteThe occasions in the first sample case are:1.l= 4,r= 4sincemax{2} =min{2}.2.l= 4,r= 5sincemax{2, 1} =min{2, 3}.There are no occasions in the second sample case since Mike will answer3to any query pair, but !Mike will always answer1.",
