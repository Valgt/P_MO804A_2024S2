    "statement": "D. Make a Permutation!time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIvan has an array consisting ofnelements. Each of the elements is an integer from1ton.Recently Ivan learned about permutations and their lexicographical order. Now he wants to change (replace)minimumnumber of elements in his array in such a way that his array becomes apermutation(i.e. each of the integers from1tonwas encountered in his array exactly once). If there are multiple ways to do it he wants to find thelexicographically minimalpermutation among them.Thus minimizing the number of changes has the first priority, lexicographical minimizing has the second priority.In order to determine which of the two permutations is lexicographically smaller, we compare their first elements. If they are equal — compare the second, and so on. If we have two permutationsxandy, thenxis lexicographically smaller ifxi<yi, whereiis the first index in which the permutationsxandydiffer.Determine the array Ivan will obtain after performing all the changes.InputThe first line contains an single integern(2 ≤n≤ 200 000) — the number of elements in Ivan's array.The second line contains a sequence of integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤n) — the description of Ivan's array.OutputIn the first line printq— the minimum number of elements that need to be changed in Ivan's array in order to make his array a permutation. In the second line, print thelexicographically minimalpermutation which can be obtained from array withqchanges.ExamplesInput43 2 2 3Output21 2 4 3Input64 5 6 3 2 1Output04 5 6 3 2 1Input106 8 4 6 7 1 6 3 4 5Output32 8 4 6 7 1 9 3 10 5NoteIn the first example Ivan needs to replace number three in position1with number one, and number two in position3with number four. Then he will get a permutation[1, 2, 4, 3]with only two changed numbers — this permutation is lexicographically minimal among all suitable.In the second example Ivan does not need to change anything because his array already is a permutation.",
