To telegraph the ternary number the Borze alphabet is used. Digit 0 is transmitted as«.», 1 as«-.»and 2 as«--». You are to decode the Borze code, i.e. to find out the ternary number given its representation in Borze alphabet.InputThe first line contains a number in Borze code. The length of the string is between 1 and 200 characters. It's guaranteed that the given string is a valid Borze code of some ternary number (this number can have leading zeroes).OutputOutput the decoded ternary number. It can have leading zeroes.ExamplesInput.-.--Output012Input--.Output20Input-..-.--Output1012",
