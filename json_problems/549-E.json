    "statement": "E. Sasha Circletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBerlanders like to eat cones after a hard day. Misha Square and Sasha Circle are local authorities of Berland. Each of them controls its points of cone trade. Misha hasnpoints, Sasha —m. Since their subordinates constantly had conflicts with each other, they decided to build a fence in the form of a circle, so that the points of trade of one businessman are strictly inside a circle, and points of the other one are strictly outside. It doesn't matter which of the two gentlemen will have his trade points inside the circle.Determine whether they can build a fence or not.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 10000), numbers of Misha's and Sasha's trade points respectively.The nextnlines contains pairs of space-separated integersMx,My(- 104≤Mx,My≤ 104), coordinates of Misha's trade points.The nextmlines contains pairs of space-separated integersSx,Sy(- 104≤Sx,Sy≤ 104), coordinates of Sasha's trade points.It is guaranteed that alln+mpoints are distinct.OutputThe only output line should contain either word \"YES\" without quotes in case it is possible to build a such fence or word \"NO\" in the other case.ExamplesInput2 2-1 01 00 -10 1OutputNOInput4 41 00 1-1 00 -11 1-1 1-1 -11 -1OutputYESNoteIn the first sample there is no possibility to separate points, because any circle that contains both points( - 1, 0), (1, 0)also contains at least one point from the set(0,  - 1), (0, 1), and vice-versa: any circle that contains both points(0,  - 1), (0, 1)also contains at least one point from the set( - 1, 0), (1, 0)In the second sample one of the possible solution is shown below. Misha's points are marked with red colour and Sasha's are marked with blue.",
