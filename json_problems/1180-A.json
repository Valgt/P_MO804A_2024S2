Alex and a Rhombustime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWhile playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a$$$n$$$-th order rhombusin a cell grid.A $$$1$$$-st order rhombusis just a square $$$1 \\\\times 1$$$ (i.e just a cell).A $$$n$$$-th order rhombusfor all $$$n \\\\geq 2$$$ one obtains from a$$$n-1$$$-th order rhombusadding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).Alex asks you to compute the number of cells in a$$$n$$$-th order rhombus.InputThe first and only input line contains integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$$$) — order of a rhombus whose numbers of cells should be computed.OutputPrint exactly one integer — the number of cells in a$$$n$$$-th order rhombus.ExamplesInput1Output1Input2Output5Input3Output13NoteImages of rhombus corresponding to the examples are given in the statement.",
