Calvin's source code contains a list ofncommands, each either 'U', 'R', 'D', or 'L' — instructions to move a single square up, right, down, or left, respectively. How many ways can Calvin execute a non-empty contiguous substrings of commands and return to the same square he starts in? Two substrings are considered different if they have different starting or ending indices.InputThe first line of the input contains a single positive integer,n(1 ≤n≤ 200) — the number of commands.The next line containsncharacters, each either 'U', 'R', 'D', or 'L' — Calvin's source code.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of contiguous substrings that Calvin can execute and return to his starting square.ExamplesInput6URLLDROutput2Input4DLUUOutput0Input7RLRLRLROutput12NoteIn the first case, the entire source code works, as well as the \"RL\" substring in the second and third characters.Note that, in the third case, the substring \"LR\" appears three times, and is therefore counted three times to the total result.",
