    "statement": "A. Anu Has a Functiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAnu has created her own function $$$f$$$: $$$f(x, y) = (x | y) - y$$$ where $$$|$$$ denotes thebitwise OR operation. For example, $$$f(11, 6) = (11|6) - 6 = 15 - 6 = 9$$$. It can be proved that for any nonnegative numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ value of $$$f(x, y)$$$ is also nonnegative.She would like to research more about this function and has created multiple problems for herself. But she isn't able to solve all of them and needs your help. Here is one of these problems.A value of an array $$$[a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n]$$$ is defined as $$$f(f(\\\\dots f(f(a_1, a_2), a_3), \\\\dots a_{n-1}), a_n)$$$ (see notes). You are given an array withnot necessarily distinctelements. How should you reorder its elements so that the value of the array is maximal possible?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$). Elements of the array arenot guaranteedto be different.OutputOutput $$$n$$$ integers, the reordering of the array with maximum value. If there are multiple answers, print any.ExamplesInput4 4 0 11 6Output11 6 4 0Input1 13Output13NoteIn the first testcase, value of the array $$$[11, 6, 4, 0]$$$ is $$$f(f(f(11, 6), 4), 0) = f(f(9, 4), 0) = f(9, 0) = 9$$$.$$$[11, 4, 0, 6]$$$ is also a valid answer.",
