You are also given a sequence of digitssof lengthm. The digit in positionj(1 ≤j≤m) of sequencesmeans that you can choose an arbitrary positioni(1 ≤i≤n) inaand replace the digit in the chosen positioniwithsj. Each element in the sequencescan participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given numberagets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements froms.InputThe first line contains positive integera. Its lengthnis positive and doesn't exceed105. The second line contains sequence of digitss. Its lengthmis positive and doesn't exceed105. The digits in the sequencesare written consecutively without any separators.The given numberadoesn't contain leading zeroes.OutputPrint the maximum value that can be obtained fromaafter a series of replacements.
