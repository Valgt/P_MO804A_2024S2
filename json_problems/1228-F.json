Let's define following tree generation asMcDic's generation:Make a complete and full binary tree of $$$2^{n} - 1$$$ vertices. Complete and full binary tree means a tree that exactly one vertex is a root, all leaves have the same depth (distance from the root), and all non-leaf nodes have exactly two child nodes.Select a non-root vertex $$$v$$$ from that binary tree.Remove $$$v$$$ from tree and make new edges between $$$v$$$'s parent and $$$v$$$'s direct children. If $$$v$$$ has no children, then no new edges will be made.You have a tree. Determine if this tree can be made by McDic's generation. If yes, then find the parent vertex of removed vertex in tree.InputThe first line contains integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 17$$$).The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$2^{n} - 3$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_{i}$$$ and $$$b_{i}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_{i} \\\\lt b_{i} \\\\le 2^{n} - 2$$$) — meaning there is an edge between $$$a_{i}$$$ and $$$b_{i}$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.OutputPrint two lines.In the first line, print a single integer — the number of answers. If given tree cannot be made by McDic's generation, then print $$$0$$$.In the second line, print all possible answers in ascending order, separated by spaces. If the given tree cannot be made by McDic's generation, then don't print anything.ExamplesInput4 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 3 6 3 13 3 14 4 7 4 8 5 9 5 10 6 11 6 12Output1 3Input2 1 2Output2 1 2Input3 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6Output0NoteIn the first example, $$$3$$$ is the only possible answer.In the second example, there are $$$2$$$ possible answers.In the third example, the tree can't be generated by McDic's generation.",
