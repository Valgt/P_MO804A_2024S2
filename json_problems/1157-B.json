Long Numbertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a long decimal number $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ digits from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$. You also have a function $$$f$$$ that maps every digit from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ to some (possibly the same) digit from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$.You can perform the following operationno more than once: choose a non-emptycontiguous subsegmentof digits in $$$a$$$, and replace each digit $$$x$$$ from this segment with $$$f(x)$$$. For example, if $$$a = 1337$$$, $$$f(1) = 1$$$, $$$f(3) = 5$$$, $$$f(7) = 3$$$, and you choose the segment consisting of three rightmost digits, you get $$$1553$$$ as the result.What is the maximum possible number you can obtain applying this operation no more than once?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the number of digits in $$$a$$$.The second line contains a string of $$$n$$$ characters, denoting the number $$$a$$$. Each character is a decimal digit from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$.The third line contains exactly $$$9$$$ integers $$$f(1)$$$, $$$f(2)$$$, ..., $$$f(9)$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le f(i) \\\\le 9$$$).OutputPrint the maximum number you can get after applying the operation described in the statement no more than once.ExamplesInput4 1337 1 2 5 4 6 6 3 1 9Output1557Input5 11111 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1Output99999Input2 33 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1Output33",
