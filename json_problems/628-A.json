The participants are playing by an olympic system, so the winners move on and the losers drop out.The tournament takes place in the following way (below,mis the number of the participants of the current round):letkbe the maximal power of the number2such thatk≤m,kparticipants compete in the current round and a half of them passes to the next round, the otherm-kparticipants pass to the next round directly,when only one participant remains, the tournament finishes.Each match requiresbbottles of water for each participant and one bottle for the judge. Besidesptowels are given to each participant for the whole tournament.Find the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament.Note that it's a tennis tournament so in each match two participants compete (one of them will win and the other will lose).InputThe only line contains three integersn,b,p(1 ≤n,b,p≤ 500) — the number of participants and the parameters described in the problem statement.OutputPrint two integersxandy— the number of bottles and towels need for the tournament.ExamplesInput5 2 3Output20 15Input8 2 4Output35 32NoteIn the first example will be three rounds:in the first round will be two matches and for each match5bottles of water are needed (two for each of the participants and one for the judge),in the second round will be only one match, so we need another5bottles of water,in the third round will also be only one match, so we need another5bottles of water.So in total we need20bottles of water.In the second example no participant will move on to some round directly.",
