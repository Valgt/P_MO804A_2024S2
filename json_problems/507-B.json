One day he came up with a very interesting problem.Amr has a circle of radiusrand center in point(x,y). He wants the circle center to be in new position(x',y').In one step Amr can put a pin to the border of the circle in a certain point, then rotate the circle around that pin by any angle and finally remove the pin.Help Amr to achieve his goal in minimum number of steps.InputInput consists of 5 space-separated integersr,x,y,x'y'(1 ≤r≤ 105,- 105≤x,y,x',y' ≤ 105), circle radius, coordinates of original center of the circle and coordinates of destination center of the circle respectively.OutputOutput a single integer — minimum number of steps required to move the center of the circle to the destination point.ExamplesInput2 0 0 0 4Output1Input1 1 1 4 4Output3Input4 5 6 5 6Output0NoteIn the first sample test the optimal way is to put a pin at point(0, 2)and rotate the circle by180degrees counter-clockwise (or clockwise, no matter).",
