So Vova decided to try one of these.Vova hasncards in his collection. Each of these cards is characterised by its powerpi, magic numberciand levelli. Vova wants to build a deck with total power not less thank, but magic numbers may not allow him to do so — Vova can't place two cards in a deck if the sum of the magic numbers written on these cards is a prime number. Also Vova cannot use a card if its level is greater than the level of Vova's character.At the moment Vova's character's level is1. Help Vova to determine the minimum level he needs to reach in order to build a deck with the required total power.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 100,1 ≤k≤ 100000).Thennlines follow, each of these lines contains three numbers that represent the corresponding card:pi,ciandli(1 ≤pi≤ 1000,1 ≤ci≤ 100000,1 ≤li≤n).OutputIf Vova won't be able to build a deck with required power, print- 1. Otherwise print the minimum level Vova has to reach in order to build a deck.ExamplesInput5 85 5 11 5 44 6 31 12 43 12 1Output4Input3 74 4 15 8 25 3 3Output2",
