    "statement": "E. Road to Hometime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOnce Danil the student was returning home from tram stop lately by straight road of lengthL. The stop is located at the pointx= 0, but the Danil's home — at the pointx=L. Danil goes fromx= 0tox=Lwith a constant speed and does not change direction of movement.There arenstreet lights at the road, each of which lights some continuous segment of the road. All of thenlightened segments do not share common points.Danil loves to sing, thus he wants to sing his favourite song over and over again during his walk. As soon as non-lightened segments of the road scare him, he sings only when he goes through the lightened segments.Danil passes distancepwhile performing his favourite song once. Danil can't start another performance if the segment passed while performing is not fully lightened. Moreover, if Danil has taken a pause between two performances, he is not performing while not having passed a segment of length at leastt. Formally,Danil can start single performance at a pointxonly if every point of segment[x,x+p]is lightened;If Danil has finished performing at a pointx+p, then the next performance can be started only at a pointysuch thaty=x+pory≥x+p+tsatisfying the statement under the point1.Blue half-circles denote performances. Please note that just after Danil has taken a pause in performing, he has not sang for a path of length of at leastt.Determine how many times Danil can perform his favourite song during his walk fromx= 0tox=L.Please note that Danil does not break a single performance, thus, started singing another time, he finishes singing when having a segment of length ofppassed from the performance start point.InputThe first line of the input contains four integersL,n,pandt(1 ≤L≤ 109,0 ≤n≤ 100 000,1 ≤p≤ 109,1 ≤t≤ 109) — the length of the Danil's path, the number of street lights at the road, the distance Danil passes while doing single performance and the minimum distance of pause respectively.The nextnlines describe segments lightened by street lights.i-th of them contains two integersli,ri(0 ≤li<ri≤L) — the endpoints of the segment lightened byi-th street light. It is guaranteed that no two segments are intersecting, nesting, or touching each other. The segments are given in the order from left to right.OutputPrint the only integer — the maximum number of performances of Danil's favourite song on the path fromx= 0tox=L.ExamplesInput17 2 2 60 913 17Output5Input12 2 2 20 56 11Output4Input12 2 2 40 56 11Output3NoteThe first sample case is just about corresponding to the picture from the statement.",
