He has an expression of form, wherex1,x2, ...,xnare digits from1to9, and signrepresents either a plus '+' or the multiplication sign'*'. Vanya needs to addonepair of brackets in this expression so that to maximize the value of the resulting expression.InputThe first line contains expressions(1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5001,|s|is odd), its odd positions only contain digits from1to9, and even positions only contain signs+and*.The number of signs*doesn't exceed 15.OutputIn the first line print the maximum possible value of an expression.ExamplesInput3+5*7+8*4Output303Input2+3*5Output25Input3*4*5Output60NoteNote to the first sample test.3 + 5 * (7 + 8) * 4 = 303.Note to the second sample test.(2 + 3) * 5 = 25.Note to the third sample test.(3 * 4) * 5 = 60(also many other variants are valid, for instance,(3) * 4 * 5 = 60).",
