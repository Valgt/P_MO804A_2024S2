Vitaly and Cycletime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAfter Vitaly was expelled from the university, he became interested in the graph theory.Vitaly especially liked the cycles of an odd length in which each vertex occurs at most once.Vitaly was wondering how to solve the following problem. You are given an undirected graph consisting ofnvertices andmedges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to findt— the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must findw— the number of ways to addtedges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandm(— the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Nextmlines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integersai,bi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n) — the vertices that are connected by thei-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.OutputPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integerstandw— the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.ExamplesInput4 41 21 34 24 3Output1 2Input3 31 22 33 1Output0 1Input3 0Output3 1NoteThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.",
