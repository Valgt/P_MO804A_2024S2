You choose $$$n$$$ cells $$$(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),\\\\dots,(x_n,y_n)$$$ in the grid $$$n\\\\times n$$$ where $$$1\\\\le x_i\\\\le n$$$ and $$$1\\\\le y_i\\\\le n$$$.Let $$$\\\\mathcal{H}$$$ be the set ofdistinctManhattan distances between any pair of cells. Your task is to maximize the size of $$$\\\\mathcal{H}$$$. Examples of sets and their construction are given in the notes.If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.Manhattan distance between cells $$$(x_1,y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2,y_2)$$$ equals $$$|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 50$$$) — the number of test cases.Each of the following $$$t$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\\\le n\\\\le 10^3$$$).OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ points which maximize the size of $$$\\\\mathcal{H}$$$. It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each test case.ExampleInput523456Output1 1 1 2  2 1 2 3 3 1  1 1 1 3 4 3 4 4  1 1 1 3 1 4 2 1 5 5  1 4 1 5 1 6 5 2 5 5 6 1NoteIn the first testcase we have $$$n=2$$$. One of the possible arrangements is:The arrangement with cells located in $$$(1,1)$$$ and $$$(1,2)$$$.In this case $$$\\\\mathcal{H}=\\\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\\\}=\\\\{0,0,1\\\\}=\\\\{0,1\\\\}$$$. Hence, the size of $$$\\\\mathcal{H}$$$ is $$$2$$$. It can be shown that it is the greatest possible answer.In the second testcase we have $$$n=3$$$. The optimal arrangement is:The arrangement with cells located in $$$(2,1)$$$, $$$(2,3)$$$ and $$$(3,1)$$$.$$$\\\\mathcal{H}$$$=$$$\\\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\\\}$$$=$$$\\\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\\\}$$$=$$$\\\\{0,1,2,3\\\\}$$$.For $$$n=4$$$ a possible arrangement is:For $$$n=5$$$ a possible arrangement is:For $$$n=6$$$ a possible arrangement is:",
