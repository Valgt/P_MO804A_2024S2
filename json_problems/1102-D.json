Balanced Ternary Stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of exactly $$$n$$$ characters, and each character is either '0', '1' or '2'. Such strings are calledternary strings.Your task is toreplace minimum number of charactersin this string with other characters to obtain abalancedternary string (balancedternary string is a ternary string such that the number of characters '0' in this string is equal to the number of characters '1', and the number of characters '1' (and '0' obviously) is equal to the number of characters '2').Among all possiblebalancedternary strings you have to obtain the lexicographically (alphabetically) smallest.Note that you can neither remove characters from the string nor add characters to the string. Also note that you can replace the given characters only with characters '0', '1' and '2'.It isguaranteedthat the answer exists.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n$$$ isdivisible by $$$3$$$) — the number of characters in $$$s$$$.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting of exactly $$$n$$$ characters '0', '1' and '2'.OutputPrint one string — the lexicographically (alphabetically) smallestbalancedternary string which can be obtained from the given one withminimumnumber of replacements.Because $$$n$$$ isdivisible by $$$3$$$it is obvious that the answer exists. And it is obvious that there is only one possible answer.ExamplesInput3 121Output021Input6 000000Output001122Input6 211200Output211200Input6 120110Output120120",
