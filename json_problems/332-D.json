Theft of Blueprintstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutInsurgents accidentally got hold of the plan of a top secret research polygon created on a distant planet for the needs of the Galaxy Empire. The insurgents suppose that this polygon is developing new deadly weapon. The polygon consists ofnmissile silos connected by bidirectional underground passages. The passages are linked to laboratories where research is conducted. Naturally, the passages are guarded severely: the passage between silosiandjis patrolled byci,jwar droids.The insurgents studied the polygon plan and noticed its unusual structure. As it turned out, for anyk-element set of silosSthere is exactly one silo that is directly connected by a passage with each silo fromS(we'll call this siloadjacent withS). Having considered that, the insurgents decided to act as follows:they choose ak-element set of silosS;a group of scouts lands from the air into each silo fromS;each group moves along the corresponding passage to the silo, adjacent withS(as the scouts move, they check out the laboratories and watch for any signs of weapon blueprints);in the silo, adjacent withS, the groups get on the ship and fly away.The danger of the operationis the total number of droids that patrol the passages through which the scouts will go. The danger of the operation obviously only depends on the way to choose setS. The insurgents haven't yet decided on the exact silos to send the scouts to. However, they already want to start preparing the weapons for the scout groups. To do that, the insurgents need to know the mathematical average of the dangers of the operations that correspond to all possible ways to choose setS. Solve this problem to help the insurgents protect the ideals of the Republic!InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(2 ≤n≤ 2000,1 ≤k≤n- 1) — the number of silos and the number of scout groups, correspondingly. The nextn- 1lines describe the polygon plan: thei-th of these lines containsn-iintegersci,i+ 1,ci,i+ 2, ...,ci,n— the number of droids that patrol the corresponding passages (-1 ≤ci,j≤ 109; ifci,j=-1, then silosiandjdon't have a passage between them). All passages are bidirectional, that is, we can assume thatci,j=cj,i. No passages connect a silo with itself. It is guaranteed that the polygon plan meets the conditions of the problem statement.OutputPrint the average danger of the scouting operation,rounded down to an integer. Note that at the given limits the answer to the problemalwaysfits into the standard integer 64-bit data type.Please do not use the%lldspecifier to write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use thecoutstream or the%I64dspecifier.ExamplesInput6 1-1 -1 -1 8 -1-1 5 -1 -1-1 -1 3-1 -1-1Output5Input3 210 011Output14NoteIn the first sample there are 6 one-element sets of silos. For sets{1},{5}the operation danger will equal 8, for sets{3},{6}— 3, for sets{2},{4}— 5. The mathematical average equals.In the second sample there are 3 two-elements sets of silos:{1, 3}(danger equals 21),{1, 2}(danger equals 11),{2, 3}(danger equals 10).
