In mathematics, GCD is the greatest common divisor, and it's an easy task to calculate the GCD between two positive integers.A common divisor for two positive numbers is a number which both numbers are divisible by.But your teacher wants to give you a harder task, in this task you have to find the greatest common divisordbetween two integersaandbthat is in a given range fromlowtohigh(inclusive), i.e.low≤d≤high. It is possible that there is no common divisor in the given range.You will be given the two integersaandb, thennqueries. Each query is a range fromlowtohighand you have to answer each query.InputThe first line contains two integersaandb, the two integers as described above (1 ≤a,b≤ 109). The second line contains one integern, the number of queries (1 ≤n≤ 104). Thennlines follow, each line contains one query consisting of two integers,lowandhigh(1 ≤low≤high≤ 109).OutputPrintnlines. Thei-th of them should contain the result of thei-th query in the input. If there is no common divisor in the given range for any query, you should print-1as a result for this query.ExamplesInput9 2731 510 119 11Output3-19",
