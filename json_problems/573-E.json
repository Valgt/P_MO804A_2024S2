He often goes bowling with his friends. Today he feels really good and tries to beat his own record!For rolling a ball one gets a score — an integer (maybe negative) number of points. Score fori-th roll is multiplied byiand scores are summed up. So, forkrolls with scoress1,s2, ...,sk, total score is. Total score is0if there were no rolls.Limak madenrolls and got scoreaifori-th of them. He wants to maximize his total score and he came up with an interesting idea. He will cancel some rolls, saying that something distracted him or there was a strong wind.Limak is able to cancel any number of rolls, maybe even all or none of them. Total score is calculated as if there were only non-canceled rolls. Look at the sample tests for clarification. What maximum total score can Limak get?InputThe first line contains single integern(1 ≤n≤ 105).The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(|ai| ≤ 107)- scores for Limak's rolls.OutputPrint the maximum possible total score after choosing rolls to cancel.ExamplesInput5-2 -8 0 5 -3Output13Input6-10 20 -30 40 -50 60Output400NoteIn first sample Limak should cancel rolls with scores- 8and- 3. Then he is left with three rolls with scores- 2, 0, 5. Total score is1·( - 2) + 2·0 + 3·5 = 13.In second sample Limak should cancel roll with score- 50. Total score is1·( - 10) + 2·20 + 3·( - 30) + 4·40 + 5·60 = 400.",
