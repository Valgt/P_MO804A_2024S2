    "statement": "C. Mixing Watertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are two infinite sources of water:hot water of temperature $$$h$$$;cold water of temperature $$$c$$$ ($$$c < h$$$).You perform the following procedure of alternating moves:takeonecup of thehotwater and pour it into an infinitely deep barrel;takeonecup of thecoldwater and pour it into an infinitely deep barrel;takeonecup of thehotwater $$$\\\\dots$$$and so on $$$\\\\dots$$$Note that you always start with the cup of hot water.The barrel is initially empty. You have to pourat least one cupinto the barrel. The water temperature in the barrel is an average of the temperatures of the poured cups.You want to achieve a temperature as close as possible to $$$t$$$. So if the temperature in the barrel is $$$t_b$$$, then theabsolute differenceof $$$t_b$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$|t_b - t|$$$) should be as small as possible.How many cups should you pour into the barrel, so that the temperature in it is as close as possible to $$$t$$$? If there are multiple answers with the minimum absolute difference, then print the smallest of them.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.Each of the next $$$T$$$ lines contains three integers $$$h$$$, $$$c$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c < h \\\\le 10^6$$$; $$$c \\\\le t \\\\le h$$$) — the temperature of the hot water, the temperature of the cold water and the desired temperature in the barrel.OutputFor each testcase print a single positive integer — the minimum number of cups required to be poured into the barrel to achieve the closest temperature to $$$t$$$.ExampleInput3 30 10 20 41 15 30 18 13 18Output2 7 1NoteIn the first testcase the temperature after $$$2$$$ poured cups: $$$1$$$ hot and $$$1$$$ cold is exactly $$$20$$$. So that is the closest we can achieve.In the second testcase the temperature after $$$7$$$ poured cups: $$$4$$$ hot and $$$3$$$ cold is about $$$29.857$$$. Pouring more water won't get us closer to $$$t$$$ than that.In the third testcase the temperature after $$$1$$$ poured cup: $$$1$$$ hot is $$$18$$$. That's exactly equal to $$$t$$$.",
