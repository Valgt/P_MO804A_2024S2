The Next Good Stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutIn problems on strings one often has to find a string with some particular properties. The problem authors were reluctant to waste time on thinking of a name for some string so they called itgood. A string is good if it doesn't have palindrome substrings longer than or equal tod.You are given strings, consisting only of lowercase English letters. Find a good stringtwith length|s|, consisting of lowercase English letters, which is lexicographically larger thans. Of all such strings stringtmust be lexicographically minimum.We will call a non-empty strings[a...b] =sasa+ 1...sb(1 ≤a≤b≤ |s|)asubstringof strings=s1s2...s|s|.A non-empty strings=s1s2...snis calleda palindromeif for allifrom1tonthe following fulfills:si=sn-i+ 1.

Characters in such strings are compared like their ASCII codes.InputThe first line contains integerd(1 ≤d≤ |s|).The second line contains a non-empty strings, its length is no more than4·105characters. The string consists of lowercase English letters.OutputPrint the good string that lexicographically followss, has the same length and consists of only lowercase English letters. If such string does not exist, print \"Impossible\" (without the quotes).ExamplesInput3aaaaaaaOutputaabbcaaInput3zzyzzzzOutputImpossibleInput4abbabbbabbbOutputabbbcaaabab",
