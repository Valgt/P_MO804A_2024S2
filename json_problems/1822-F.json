Gardening Friendstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTwo friends, Alisa and Yuki, planted a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices in their garden. A tree is an undirected graph without cycles, loops, or multiple edges. Each edge in this tree has a length of $$$k$$$. Initially, vertex $$$1$$$ is the root of the tree.Alisa and Yuki are growing the tree not just for fun, they want to sell it. Thecostof the tree is defined as the maximum distance from the root to a vertex among all vertices of the tree. The distance between two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ is the sum of the lengths of the edges on the path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.The girls took a course in gardening, so they know how to modify the tree. Alisa and Yuki can spend $$$c$$$ coins to shift the root of the tree to one of theneighbors of the current root. This operation can be performed any number of times (possibly zero). Note that the structure of the tree is left unchanged; the only change is which vertex is the root.The friends want to sell the tree with the maximumprofit. Theprofitis defined as the difference between thecostof the tree and the total cost of operations.The profit iscostof the tree minus the total cost of operations.Help the girls and find the maximumprofitthey can get by applying operations to the tree any number of times (possibly zero).InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k, c \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree, the length of each edge, and the cost of the operation.The next $$$n - 1$$$ lines of the test case contain pairs of integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u_i, v_i \\\\le n$$$) — the edges of the graph. These edges form a tree.The sum of the values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximumprofitthat Yuki and Alisa can get.ExampleInput43 2 32 13 15 4 12 14 25 43 46 5 34 16 12 65 13 210 6 41 31 99 77 66 49 22 88 55 10Output2 12 17 32",
