He has recently come up with one interesting problem.TheOxaxis of coordinates hasnsegments, thei-th segment starts in positionliand ends in positionri(we will mark it as[li,ri]). Your task is to processmqueries, each consists of numbercntiand a set ofcnticoordinates of points located on theOxaxis. The answer to the query is the number of segments, such that each of them contains at least one point from the query. Segment[l,r]containspointq, ifl≤q≤r.Valera found the solution of this problem too difficult. So he asked you to help him. Help Valera.InputThe first line contains two integersn,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 3·105) — the number of segments on the axis of coordinates and the number of queries.Nextnlines contain the descriptions of the segments. Thei-th line contains two positive integersli,ri(1 ≤li≤ri≤ 106) — the borders of thei-th segment.Nextmlines contain the description of the queries, one per line. Each line starts from integercnti(1 ≤cnti≤ 3·105) — the number of points in thei-th query. Then the line containscntidistinct positive integersp1,p2, ...,pcnti(1 ≤p1<p2< ... <pcnti≤ 106) — the coordinates of points in thei-th query.It is guaranteed that the total number of points in all queries doesn't exceed3·105.OutputPrintmnon-negative integers, where thei-th number is the response to thei-th query.ExamplesInput3 31 34 56 73 1 4 72 4 51 8Output310",
