Subarray Sortingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ and an array $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$.For one operation you can sort in non-decreasing order any subarray $$$a[l \\\\dots r]$$$ of the array $$$a$$$.For example, if $$$a = [4, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1]$$$ and you choose subbarray $$$a[2 \\\\dots 5]$$$, then the array turns into $$$[4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]$$$.You are asked to determine whether it is possible to obtain the array $$$b$$$ by applying this operation any number of times (possibly zero) to the array $$$a$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the number of queries.The first line of each query contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each query contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$).The third line of each query contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le n$$$).It is guaranteed that $$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ over all queries in a test.OutputFor each query printYES(in any letter case) if it is possible to obtain an array $$$b$$$ andNO(in any letter case) otherwise.ExampleInput4 7 1 7 1 4 4 5 6 1 1 4 4 5 7 6 5 1 1 3 3 5 1 1 3 3 5 2 1 1 1 2 3 1 2 3 3 2 1OutputYES YES NO NONoteIn first test case the can sort subarray $$$a_1 \\\\dots a_5$$$, then $$$a$$$ will turn into $$$[1, 1, 4, 4, 7, 5, 6]$$$, and then sort subarray $$$a_5 \\\\dots a_6$$$.",
