Vanya and Tabletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVanya has a table consisting of100rows, each row contains100cells. The rows are numbered by integers from1to100from bottom to top, the columns are numbered from1to100from left to right.In this table, Vanya chosenrectangles with sides that go along borders of squares (some rectangles probably occur multiple times). After that for each cell of the table he counted the number of rectangles it belongs to and wrote this number into it. Now he wants to find the sum of values in all cells of the table and as the table is too large, he asks you to help him find the result.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of rectangles.Each of the followingnlines contains four integersx1,y1,x2,y2(1 ≤x1≤x2≤ 100,1 ≤y1≤y2≤ 100), wherex1andy1are the number of the column and row of the lower left cell andx2andy2are the number of the column and row of the upper right cell of a rectangle.OutputIn a single line print the sum of all values in the cells of the table.ExamplesInput21 1 2 32 2 3 3Output10Input21 1 3 31 1 3 3Output18NoteNote to the first sample test:Values of the table in the first three rows and columns will be as follows:121121110So, the sum of values will be equal to10.Note to the second sample test:Values of the table in the first three rows and columns will be as follows:222222222So, the sum of values will be equal to18.",
