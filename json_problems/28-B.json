Initially each cell contains a number which is equal to it's ordinal number (starting from1). Also each cell determined it's favourite number. On it's movei-th cell can exchange it's value with the value of some otherj-th cell, if|i-j| =di, wherediis a favourite number ofi-th cell. Cells make moves in any order, the number of moves is unlimited.The favourite number of each cell will be given to you. You will also be given a permutation of numbers from1ton. You are to determine whether the game could move to this state.InputThe first line contains positive integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of cells in the array. The second line containsndistinct integers from1ton— permutation. The last line containsnintegers from1ton— favourite numbers of the cells.OutputIf the given state is reachable in the described game, outputYES, otherwiseNO.ExamplesInput55 4 3 2 11 1 1 1 1OutputYESInput74 3 5 1 2 7 64 6 6 1 6 6 1OutputNOInput74 2 5 1 3 7 64 6 6 1 6 6 1OutputYES",
