New Year and Curlingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputCarol is currently curling.She hasndisks each with radiusron the 2D plane.Initially she has all these disks above the liney= 10100.She then will slide the disks towards the liney= 0one by one in order from1ton.When she slides thei-th disk, she will place its center at the point(xi, 10100). She will then push it so the disk’sycoordinate continuously decreases, andxcoordinate stays constant. The disk stops once it touches the liney= 0or it touches any previous disk. Note that once a disk stops moving, it will not move again, even if hit by another disk.Compute they-coordinates of centers of all the disks after all disks have been pushed.InputThe first line will contain two integersnandr(1 ≤n,r≤ 1 000), the number of disks, and the radius of the disks, respectively.The next line will containnintegersx1,x2, ...,xn(1 ≤xi≤ 1 000) — thex-coordinates of the disks.OutputPrint a single line withnnumbers. Thei-th number denotes they-coordinate of the center of thei-th disk. The output will be accepted if it has absolute or relative error at most10- 6.Namely, let's assume that your answer for a particular value of a coordinate isaand the answer of the jury isb. The checker program will consider your answer correct iffor all coordinates.ExampleInput6 25 5 6 8 3 12Output2 6.0 9.87298334621 13.3370849613 12.5187346573 13.3370849613NoteThe final positions of the disks will look as follows:In particular, note the position of the last disk.",
