Funt during this year is equal ton(n≥ 2) burles and the amount of tax he has to pay is calculated as the maximum divisor ofn(not equal ton, of course). For example, ifn= 6then Funt has to pay3burles, while forn= 25he needs to pay5and ifn= 2he pays only1burle.As mr. Funt is a very opportunistic person he wants to cheat a bit. In particular, he wants to split the initialnin several partsn1+n2+ ... +nk=n(herekis arbitrary, evenk= 1is allowed) and pay the taxes for each part separately. He can't make some part equal to1because it will reveal him. So, the conditionni≥ 2should hold for allifrom1tok.Ostap Bender wonders, how many money Funt has to pay (i.e. minimal) if he chooses and optimal way to splitnin parts.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 2·109) — the total year income of mr. Funt.OutputPrint one integer — minimum possible number of burles that mr. Funt has to pay as a tax.ExamplesInput4Output2Input27Output3",
