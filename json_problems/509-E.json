In order to evaluate which songs he likes more, he introduced the notion of the song'sprettiness. The title of the song is a word consisting of uppercase Latin letters. Theprettinessof the song is theprettinessof its title.Let's define thesimple prettinessof a word as the ratio of the number of vowels in the word to the number of all letters in the word.Let's define theprettinessof a word as the sum ofsimple prettinessof all the substrings of the word.More formally, let's define the functionvowel(c)which is equal to1, ifcis a vowel, and to0otherwise. Letsibe thei-th character of strings, andsi..jbe the substring of words, staring at thei-th character and ending at thej-th character (sisi+ 1...sj,i≤j).Then thesimple prettinessofsis defined by the formula:TheprettinessofsequalsFind theprettinessof the given song title.We assume that the vowels areI,E,A,O,U,Y.InputThe input contains a single strings(1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5·105) — the title of the song.OutputPrint theprettinessof the song with the absolute or relative error of at most10- 6.ExamplesInputIEAIAIOOutput28.0000000InputBYOBOutput5.8333333InputYISVOWELOutput17.0500000NoteIn the first sample all letters are vowels.
