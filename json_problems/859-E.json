Things were getting quite cramped in the office. You've been put in charge of creating a new seating chart for the engineers. The desks are numbered, and you sent out a survey to the engineering team asking each engineer the number of the desk they currently sit at, and the number of the desk they would like to sit at (which may be the same as their current desk). Each engineer must either remain where they sit, or move to the desired seat they indicated in the survey. No two engineers currently sit at the same desk, nor may any two engineers sit at the same desk in the new seating arrangement.How many seating arrangements can you create that meet the specified requirements? The answer may be very large, so compute it modulo1000000007 = 109+ 7.InputInput will begin with a line containingN(1 ≤N≤ 100000), the number of engineers.Nlines follow, each containing exactly two integers. Thei-th line contains the number of the current desk of thei-th engineer and the number of the desk thei-th engineer wants to move to. Desks are numbered from1to2·N. It is guaranteed that no two engineers sit at the same desk.OutputPrint the number of possible assignments, modulo1000000007 = 109+ 7.ExamplesInput41 55 23 77 3Output6Input51 102 103 104 105 5Output5NoteThese are the possible assignments for the first example:1 5 3 71 2 3 75 2 3 71 5 7 31 2 7 35 2 7 3",
