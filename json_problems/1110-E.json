Magic Stonestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGrigory has $$$n$$$ magic stones, conveniently numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Thechargeof the $$$i$$$-th stone is equal to $$$c_i$$$.Sometimes Grigory gets bored and selects someinnerstone (that is, some stone with index $$$i$$$, where $$$2 \\\\le i \\\\le n - 1$$$), and after thatsynchronizesit with neighboring stones. After that, the chosen stone loses its own charge, but acquires the charges from neighboring stones. In other words, its charge $$$c_i$$$ changes to $$$c_i' = c_{i + 1} + c_{i - 1} - c_i$$$.Andrew, Grigory's friend, also has $$$n$$$ stones with charges $$$t_i$$$. Grigory is curious, whether there exists a sequence of zero or moresynchronizationoperations, which transforms charges of Grigory's stones into charges of corresponding Andrew's stones, that is, changes $$$c_i$$$ into $$$t_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of magic stones.The second line contains integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le c_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^9$$$) — the charges of Grigory's stones.The second line contains integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\\\ldots, t_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le t_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^9$$$) — the charges of Andrew's stones.OutputIf there exists a (possibly empty) sequence ofsynchronizationoperations, which changes all charges to the required ones, print \"Yes\".Otherwise, print \"No\".ExamplesInput4 7 2 4 12 7 15 10 12OutputYesInput3 4 4 4 1 2 3OutputNoNoteIn the first example, we can perform the followingsynchronizations($$$1$$$-indexed):First,synchronizethe third stone $$$[7, 2, \\\\mathbf{4}, 12] \\\\rightarrow [7, 2, \\\\mathbf{10}, 12]$$$.Thensynchronizethe second stone: $$$[7, \\\\mathbf{2}, 10, 12] \\\\rightarrow [7, \\\\mathbf{15}, 10, 12]$$$.In the second example, any operation with the second stone will not change its charge.",
