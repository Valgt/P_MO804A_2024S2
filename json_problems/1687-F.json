Koishi's Unconscious Permutationtime limit per test12 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAs she closed the Satori's eye that could read minds, Koishi gained the ability to live in unconsciousness. Even she herself does not know what she is up to.â€”Subterranean AnimismKoishi is unconsciously permuting $$$n$$$ numbers: $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, n$$$.She thinks the permutation $$$p$$$ isbeautifulif $$$s=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} [p_i+1=p_{i+1}]$$$. $$$[x]$$$ equals to $$$1$$$ if $$$x$$$ holds, or $$$0$$$ otherwise.For each $$$k\\\\in[0,n-1]$$$, she wants to know the number of beautiful permutations of length $$$n$$$ satisfying $$$k=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}[p_i<p_{i+1}]$$$.InputThere is one line containing two intergers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 250\\\\,000$$$) and $$$s$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq s < n$$$).OutputPrint one line with $$$n$$$ intergers. The $$$i$$$-th integers represents the answer of $$$k=i-1$$$, modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExamplesInput2 0Output1 0Input4 1Output0 3 6 0Input8 3Output0 0 0 35 770 980 70 0NoteLet $$$f(p)=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}[p_i<p_{i+1}]$$$.Testcase 1:$$$[2,1]$$$ is the only beautiful permutation.

The first six of them satisfy $$$f(p)=2$$$, while others satisfy $$$f(p)=1$$$.",
