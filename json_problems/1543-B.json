    "statement": "B. Customising the Tracktime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputHighway 201 is the most busy street in Rockport. Traffic cars cause a lot of hindrances to races, especially when there are a lot of them. The track which passes through this highway can be divided into $$$n$$$ sub-tracks. You are given an array $$$a$$$ where $$$a_i$$$ represents the number of traffic cars in the $$$i$$$-th sub-track. You define the inconvenience of the track as $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\\\sum\\\\limits_{j=i+1}^{n} \\\\lvert a_i-a_j\\\\rvert$$$, where $$$|x|$$$ is the absolute value of $$$x$$$.You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times: choose a traffic car and move it from its current sub-track to any other sub-track.Find the minimum inconvenience you can achieve.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t\\\\leq 10\\\\,000$$$) â€” the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\\\\leq a_i\\\\leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single line containing a single integer: the minimum inconvenience you can achieve by applying the given operation any (possibly zero) number of times.ExampleInput3 3 1 2 3 4 0 1 1 0 10 8 3 6 11 5 2 1 7 10 4Output0 4 21NoteFor the first test case, you can move a car from the $$$3$$$-rd sub-track to the $$$1$$$-st sub-track to obtain $$$0$$$ inconvenience.For the second test case, moving any car won't decrease the inconvenience of the track.",
