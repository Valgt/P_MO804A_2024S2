Onestime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a positive (greater than zero) integer $$$n$$$.You have to represent $$$n$$$ as the sum of integers (possibly negative) consisting only of ones (digits '1'). For example, $$$24 = 11 + 11 + 1 + 1$$$ and $$$102 = 111 - 11 + 1 + 1$$$.Among all possible representations, you have to find the one that uses the minimum number of ones in total.InputThe single line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n < 10^{50}$$$).OutputPrint one integer $$$x$$$ â€” the minimum number of ones, such that there exist a representation of $$$n$$$ as the sum of integers (possibly negative) that uses $$$x$$$ ones in total.ExamplesInput24Output6Input102Output7",
