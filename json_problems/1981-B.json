Turtle and an Infinite Sequencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a sequence $$$a_0, a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots$$$ of infinite length. Initially $$$a_i = i$$$ for every non-negative integer $$$i$$$.After every second, each element of the sequence willsimultaneouslychange. $$$a_i$$$ will change to $$$a_{i - 1} \\\\mid a_i \\\\mid a_{i + 1}$$$ for every positive integer $$$i$$$. $$$a_0$$$ will change to $$$a_0 \\\\mid a_1$$$. Here, $$$|$$$ denotesbitwise OR.Turtle is asked to find the value of $$$a_n$$$ after $$$m$$$ seconds. In particular, if $$$m = 0$$$, then he needs to find the initial value of $$$a_n$$$. He is tired of calculating so many values, so please help him!InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a single integer â€” the value of $$$a_n$$$ after $$$m$$$ seconds.ExampleInput90 00 10 21 05 210 120 31145 1419198 10Output0 1 3 1 7 11 23 1279 19455NoteAfter $$$1$$$ second, $$$[a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5]$$$ will become $$$[1, 3, 3, 7, 7, 7]$$$.After $$$2$$$ seconds, $$$[a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5]$$$ will become $$$[3, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7]$$$.",
