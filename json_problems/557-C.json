When he came home, Arthur noticed that the new table is unstable.In total the table Arthur bought hasnlegs, the length of thei-th leg isli.Arthur decided to make the table stable and remove some legs. For each of them Arthur determined numberdi— the amount of energy that he spends to remove thei-th leg.A table withklegs is assumed to be stable if there are more than half legs of the maximum length. For example, to make a table with5legs stable, you need to make sure it has at least three (out of these five) legs of the maximum length. Also, a table with one leg is always stable and a table with two legs is stable if and only if they have the same lengths.Your task is to help Arthur and count the minimum number of energy units Arthur should spend on making the table stable.InputThe first line of the input contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105) — the initial number of legs in the table Arthur bought.The second line of the input contains a sequence ofnintegersli(1 ≤li≤ 105), whereliis equal to the length of thei-th leg of the table.The third line of the input contains a sequence ofnintegersdi(1 ≤di≤ 200), wherediis the number of energy units that Arthur spends on removing thei-th leg off the table.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum number of energy units that Arthur needs to spend in order to make the table stable.ExamplesInput21 53 2Output2Input32 4 41 1 1Output0Input62 2 1 1 3 34 3 5 5 2 1Output8",
