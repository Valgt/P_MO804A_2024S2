    "statement": "A. Yet Another Two Integers Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.In one move, you can choose someinteger$$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$10$$$ and add it to $$$a$$$ or subtract it from $$$a$$$. In other words, you choose an integer $$$k \\\\in [1; 10]$$$ and perform $$$a := a + k$$$ or $$$a := a - k$$$. You may usedifferentvalues of $$$k$$$ in different moves.Your task is to find theminimumnumber of moves required to obtain $$$b$$$ from $$$a$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves required to obtain $$$b$$$ from $$$a$$$.ExampleInput6 5 5 13 42 18 4 1337 420 123456789 1000000000 100500 9000Output0 3 2 92 87654322 9150NoteIn the first test case of the example, you don't need to do anything.In the second test case of the example, the following sequence of moves can be applied: $$$13 \\\\rightarrow 23 \\\\rightarrow 32 \\\\rightarrow 42$$$ (add $$$10$$$, add $$$9$$$, add $$$10$$$).In the third test case of the example, the following sequence of moves can be applied: $$$18 \\\\rightarrow 10 \\\\rightarrow 4$$$ (subtract $$$8$$$, subtract $$$6$$$).",
