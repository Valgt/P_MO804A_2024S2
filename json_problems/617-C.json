Watering Flowerstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA flowerbed has many flowers and two fountains.You can adjust the water pressure and set any valuesr1(r1≥ 0)andr2(r2≥ 0), giving the distances at which the water is spread from the first and second fountain respectively. You have to set suchr1andr2that all the flowers are watered, that is, for each flower, the distance between the flower and the first fountain doesn't exceedr1, or the distance to the second fountain doesn't exceedr2. It's OK if some flowers are watered by both fountains.You need to decrease the amount of water you need, that is set suchr1andr2that all the flowers are watered and ther12+r22is minimum possible. Find this minimum value.InputThe first line of the input contains integersn,x1,y1,x2,y2(1 ≤n≤ 2000,- 107≤x1,y1,x2,y2≤ 107) — the number of flowers, the coordinates of the first and the second fountain.Next follownlines.
