The function takes two stringss1ands2. These strings must consist only of lowercase English letters, and must be the same length.The output of the functionfis another string of the same length. Thei-th character of the output is equal to the minimum of thei-th character ofs1and thei-th character ofs2.For example,f(\"ab\", \"ba\")= \"aa\", andf(\"nzwzl\", \"zizez\")= \"niwel\".You found two stringsxandyof the same length and consisting of only lowercase English letters.
