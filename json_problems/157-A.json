During the game they put numbers on the board's squares by some tricky rules we don't know. However, the game is now over and each square of the board contains exactly one number. To understand who has won, they need to count the number ofwinningsquares. To determine if the particular square is winning you should do the following. Calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this column (including the given square) and separately calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this row (including the given square). A square is consideredwinningif the sum of the column numbers isstrictlygreater than the sum of the row numbers.For instance, lets game was ended like is shown in the picture. Then the purple cell is winning, because the sum of its column numbers equals8 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 24, sum of its row numbers equals9 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 19, and24 > 19.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 30). Each of the followingnlines containnspace-separated integers. Thej-th number on thei-th line represents the number on the square that belongs to thej-th column and thei-th row on the board. All number on the board are integers from1to100.OutputPrint the single number — the number of the winning squares.ExamplesInput11Output0Input21 23 4Output2Input45 7 8 49 5 3 21 6 6 49 5 7 3Output6NoteIn the first example two upper squares are winning.In the third example three left squares in the both middle rows are winning:5 7 8 4953216649 5 7 3",
