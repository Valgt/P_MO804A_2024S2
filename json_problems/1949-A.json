Grovetime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou want to plant trees in a square lawn of size $$$n \\\\times n$$$ whose corners have Cartesian coordinates $$$(0, 0)$$$, $$$(n, 0)$$$, $$$(0, n)$$$, and $$$(n, n)$$$. Trees can only be planted at locations with integer coordinates. Every tree will grow roots within a disk of radius $$$r$$$ centered at the location where the tree was planted; such disks must be fully contained in the lawn (possibly touching the boundary of the lawn) and can only intersect each other on their boundaries.Find a configuration that maximizes the number of trees.InputThe first and only line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 20$$$) and a real number $$$r$$$ ($$$0 < r \\\\leq n/2$$$) — the length of the sides of the lawn, and the radius of the disks where each tree will grow roots. The real number $$$r$$$ is given in decimal notation with at least $$$1$$$ and at most $$$3$$$ digits after the decimal point.OutputIn the first line, print the maximum number $$$m$$$ of trees that can be planted.In the next $$$m$$$ lines, print a configuration that maximizes the number of trees. Specifically, in the $$$(i+1)$$$-th line, print two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ — the coordinates of the location where the $$$i$$$-th tree should be planted. You can print the trees in any order.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput6 1.241Output2 4 2 2 4Input9 2.0Output4 2 2 7 2 2 6 6 6NoteFor thefirst sample, the sample output is shown in the following figure.
