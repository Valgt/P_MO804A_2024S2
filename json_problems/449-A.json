    "statement": "A. Jzzhu and Chocolatetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutJzzhu has a big rectangular chocolate bar that consists ofn×munit squares. He wants to cut this bar exactlyktimes. Each cut must meet the following requirements:each cut should be straight (horizontal or vertical);each cut should go along edges of unit squares (it is prohibited to divide any unit chocolate square with cut);each cut should go inside the whole chocolate bar, and all cuts must be distinct.The picture below shows a possible way to cut a5 × 6chocolate for5times.Imagine Jzzhu have madekcuts and the big chocolate is splitted into several pieces. Consider the smallest (by area) piece of the chocolate, Jzzhu wants this piece to be as large as possible. What is the maximum possible area of smallest piece he can get with exactlykcuts? The area of a chocolate piece is the number of unit squares in it.InputA single line contains three integersn,m,k(1 ≤n,m≤ 109; 1 ≤k≤ 2·109).OutputOutput a single integer representing the answer. If it is impossible to cut the big chocolatektimes, print-1.ExamplesInput3 4 1Output6Input6 4 2Output8Input2 3 4Output-1NoteIn the first sample, Jzzhu can cut the chocolate following the picture below:In the second sample the optimal division looks like this:In the third sample, it's impossible to cut a2 × 3chocolate4times.",
