    "statement": "A. Perfect Pairtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLet us call a pair of integer numbersm-perfect, if at least one number in the pair is greater than or equal tom. Thus, the pairs (3, 3) and (0, 2) are 2-perfect while the pair (-1, 1) is not.Two integersx,yare written on the blackboard. It is allowed to erase one of them and replace it with the sum of the numbers,(x+y).What is the minimum number of such operations one has to perform in order to make the given pair of integersm-perfect?InputSingle line of the input contains three integersx,yandm(- 1018≤x,y,m≤ 1018).Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.OutputPrint the minimum number of operations or \"-1\" (without quotes), if it is impossible to transform the given pair to them-perfect one.ExamplesInput1 2 5Output2Input-1 4 15Output4Input0 -1 5Output-1NoteIn the first sample the following sequence of operations is suitable: (1, 2)(3, 2)(5, 2).In the second sample: (-1, 4)(3, 4)(7, 4)(11, 4)(15, 4).Finally, in the third samplex,ycannot be made positive, hence there is no proper sequence of operations.",
