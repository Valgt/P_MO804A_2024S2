Counting-out Rhymetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputnchildren are standing in a circle and playing the counting-out game. Children are numbered clockwise from1ton. In the beginning, the first child is considered the leader. The game is played inksteps. In thei-th step the leader counts outaipeople in clockwise order, starting from the next person. The last one to be pointed at by the leader is eliminated, and the next player after him becomes the new leader.For example, if there are children with numbers[8, 10, 13, 14, 16]currently in the circle, the leader is child13andai= 12, then counting-out rhyme ends on child16, who is eliminated. Child8becomes the leader.You have to write a program which prints the number of the child to be eliminated on every step.InputThe first line contains two integer numbersnandk(2 ≤n≤ 100,1 ≤k≤n- 1).The next line containskinteger numbersa1,a2, ...,ak(1 ≤ai≤ 109).OutputPrintknumbers, thei-th one corresponds to the number of child to be eliminated at thei-th step.ExamplesInput7 510 4 11 4 1Output4 2 5 6 1Input3 22 5Output3 2NoteLet's consider first example:In the first step child4is eliminated, child5becomes the leader.In the second step child2is eliminated, child3becomes the leader.In the third step child5is eliminated, child6becomes the leader.In the fourth step child6is eliminated, child7becomes the leader.In the final step child1is eliminated, child3becomes the leader.",
