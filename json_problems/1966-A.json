    "statement": "A. Card Exchangetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a hand of $$$n$$$ cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a fixed integer $$$k$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times:Choose any $$$k$$$ cards from your hand that all have the same number.Exchange these cards for $$$k-1$$$ cards, each of which can haveanynumber you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged).Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which has $$$k=3$$$:What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of this process?InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$, $$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of cards you have, and the number of cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.The next line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le 100$$$) — the numbers written on your cards.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you can have left in your hand after any number of operations.ExampleInput75 34 1 1 4 41 1077 24 2 1 100 5 2 310 41 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 15 23 8 1 48 76 210 20 30 10 20 406 310 20 30 10 20 40Output2 1 1 3 5 1 6NoteThe first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is $$$2$$$.In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is $$$1$$$.In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select $$$4$$$ cards numbered with $$$1$$$ and replace them with $$$3$$$ cards numbered with $$$1$$$, until there are $$$3$$$ cards left.",
