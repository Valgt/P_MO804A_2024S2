Terse princesstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdout«Next please», — the princess called and cast an estimating glance at the next groom.The princess intends to choose the most worthy groom, this is, the richest one. Whenever she sees a groom who is more rich than each of the previous ones, she says a measured «Oh...». Whenever the groom is richer than all previous ones added together, she exclaims «Wow!» (no «Oh...» in this case). At the sight of the first groom the princess stays calm and says nothing.The fortune of each groom is described with an integer between 1 and 50000. You know that during the day the princess sawngrooms, said «Oh...» exactlyatimes and exclaimed «Wow!» exactlybtimes. Your task is to output a sequence ofnintegerst1,t2, ...,tn, wheretidescribes the fortune ofi-th groom. If several sequences are possible, output any of them. If no sequence exists that would satisfy all the requirements, output a single number-1.InputThe only line of input data contains three integer numbersn,aandb(1 ≤n≤ 100, 0 ≤a,b≤ 15,n>a+b), separated with single spaces.OutputOutput any sequence of integerst1,t2, ...,tn, whereti(1 ≤ti≤ 50000) is the fortune ofi-th groom, that satisfies the given constraints.
