Each vertex is coloured in some colour.Let's call colourcdominating in the subtree of vertexvif there are no other colours that appear in the subtree of vertexvmore times than colourc. So it's possible that two or more colours will be dominating in the subtree of some vertex.The subtree of vertexvis the vertexvand all other vertices that contains vertexvin each path to the root.For each vertexvfind the sum of all dominating colours in the subtree of vertexv.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105) — the number of vertices in the tree.The second line containsnintegersci(1 ≤ci≤n),ci— the colour of thei-th vertex.Each of the nextn- 1lines contains two integersxj,yj(1 ≤xj,yj≤n) — the edge of the tree.
