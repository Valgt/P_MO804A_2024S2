Bicolored Segmentstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given $$$n$$$ segments $$$[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\\\dots, [l_n, r_n]$$$. Each segment has one of two colors: the $$$i$$$-th segment's color is $$$t_i$$$.Let's call a pair of segments $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$badif the following two conditions are met:$$$t_i \\\\ne t_j$$$;the segments $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$ and $$$[l_j, r_j]$$$ intersect, embed or touch, i. e. there exists an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$x \\\\in [l_i, r_i]$$$ and $$$x \\\\in [l_j, r_j]$$$.Calculate the maximum number of segments that can be selected from the given ones, so that there is nobadpair among the selected ones.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — number of segments.The next $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i, r_i, t_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le 10^9; t_i \\\\in \\\\{1, 2\\\\}$$$) — description of the $$$i$$$-th segment.OutputPrint the maximum number of segments that can be selected, so that there is nobadpair among the selected segments.ExamplesInput3 1 3 1 4 6 2 2 5 1Output2Input5 5 8 1 1 3 2 3 4 2 6 6 1 2 10 2Output4Input7 19 20 1 13 15 2 6 11 2 4 10 1 14 17 1 13 13 2 5 9 1Output5",
