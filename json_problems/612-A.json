Split the stringsto pieces of lengthpandq.For example, the string \"Hello\" forp= 2,q= 3can be split to the two strings \"Hel\" and \"lo\" or to the two strings \"He\" and \"llo\".Note it is allowed to split the stringsto the strings only of lengthpor to the strings only of lengthq(see the second sample test).InputThe first line contains three positive integersn,p,q(1 ≤p,q≤n≤ 100).The second line contains the stringsconsists of lowercase and uppercase latin letters and digits.OutputIf it's impossible to split the stringsto the strings of lengthpandqprint the only number \"-1\".Otherwise in the first line print integerk— the number of strings in partition ofs.Each of the nextklines should contain the strings in partition. Each string should be of the lengthporq. The string should be in order of their appearing in strings— from left to right.If there are several solutions print any of them.ExamplesInput5 2 3HelloOutput2HelloInput10 9 5CodeforcesOutput2CodeforcesInput6 4 5PrivetOutput-1Input8 1 1abacabacOutput8abacabac",
