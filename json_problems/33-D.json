The army of evil lord Van de Mart is going to conquer the whole kingdom. To the council of war called by the Berland's king Valery the Severe camenknights. After long discussions it became clear that the kingdom has exactlyncontrol points (if the enemy conquers at least one of these points, the war is lost) and each knight will occupy one of these points.Berland is divided intom+ 1regions withmfences, and the only way to get from one region to another is to climb over the fence. Each fence is a circle on a plane, no two fences have common points, and no control point is on the fence. You are givenkpairs of numbersai,bi. For each pair you have to find out: how many fences a knight from control point with indexaihas to climb over to reach control pointbi(in case when Van de Mart attacks control pointbifirst). As each knight rides a horse (it is very difficult to throw a horse over a fence), you are to find out for each pair the minimum amount of fences to climb over.InputThe first input line contains three integersn,m,k(1 ≤n,m≤ 1000,0 ≤k≤ 100000). Then follownlines, each containing two integersKxi,Kyi(- 109≤Kxi,Kyi≤ 109) — coordinates of control point with indexi. Control points can coincide.Each of the followingmlines describes fence with indexiwith three integersri,Cxi,Cyi(1 ≤ri≤ 109,- 109≤Cxi,Cyi≤ 109) — radius and center of the circle where the corresponding fence is situated.Then followkpairs of integersai,bi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n), each in a separate line — requests that you have to answer.aiandbican coincide.OutputOutput exactlyklines, each containing one integer — the answer to the corresponding request.ExamplesInput2 1 10 03 32 0 01 2Output1Input2 3 10 04 41 0 02 0 03 0 01 2Output3",
