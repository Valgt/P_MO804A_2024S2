    "statement": "F. Katya and Segments Setstime limit per test3.5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt is a very important day for Katya. She has a test in a programming class. As always, she was given an interesting problem that she solved very fast. Can you solve that problem?You are given $$$n$$$ ordered segments sets. Each segment can be represented as a pair of two integers $$$[l, r]$$$ where $$$l\\\\leq r$$$. Each set can contain an arbitrary number of segments (even $$$0$$$). It is possible that some segments are equal.You are also given $$$m$$$ queries, each of them can be represented as four numbers: $$$a, b, x, y$$$. For each segment, find out whether it is true that each set $$$p$$$ ($$$a\\\\leq p\\\\leq b$$$) contains at least one segment $$$[l, r]$$$ that lies entirely on the segment $$$[x, y]$$$, that is $$$x\\\\leq l\\\\leq r\\\\leq y$$$.Find out the answer to each query.Note that you need to solve this problemonline. That is, you will get a new query only after you print the answer for the previous query.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ $$$(1\\\\leq n,m\\\\leq 10^5, 1\\\\leq k\\\\leq 3\\\\cdot10^5)$$$ — the number of sets, queries, and segments respectively.Each of the next $$$k$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$p$$$ $$$(1\\\\leq l\\\\leq r\\\\leq 10^9, 1\\\\leq p\\\\leq n)$$$ — the limits of the segment and the index of a set, to which this segment belongs.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains four integers $$$a, b, x, y$$$ $$$(1\\\\leq a\\\\leq b\\\\leq n, 1\\\\leq x\\\\leq y\\\\leq 10^9)$$$ — the description of the query.OutputFor each query, print \"yes\" or \"no\" in a new line.InteractionAfter printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will getIdleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:fflush(stdout)orcout.flush()in C++;System.out.flush()in Java;flush(output)in Pascal;stdout.flush()in Python;see documentation for other languages.ExampleInput5 5 9 3 6 3 1 3 1 2 4 2 1 2 3 4 6 5 2 5 3 7 9 4 2 3 1 4 10 4 1 2 2 3 1 2 2 4 1 3 1 5 2 3 3 6 2 4 2 9Outputno yes yes no yesNoteFor the first query, the answer is negative since the second set does not contain a segment that lies on the segment $$$[2, 3]$$$.In the second query, the first set contains $$$[2, 3]$$$, and the second set contains $$$[2, 4]$$$.In the third query, the first set contains $$$[2, 3]$$$, the second set contains $$$[2, 4]$$$, and the third set contains $$$[2, 5]$$$.In the fourth query, the second set does not contain a segment that lies on the segment $$$[3, 6]$$$.In the fifth query, the second set contains $$$[2, 4]$$$, the third set contains $$$[2, 5]$$$, and the fourth contains $$$[7, 9]$$$.",
