View Angletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutFlatland has recently introduced a new type of an eye check for the driver's licence. The check goes like that: there is a plane with mannequins standing on it. You should tell the value of the minimum angle with the vertex at the origin of coordinates and with all mannequins standing inside or on the boarder of this angle.As you spend lots of time \"glued to the screen\", your vision is impaired. So you have to write a program that will pass the check for you.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 105)— the number of mannequins.Nextnlines contain two space-separated integers each:xi,yi(|xi|, |yi| ≤ 1000)— the coordinates of thei-th mannequin. It is guaranteed that the origin of the coordinates has no mannequin. It is guaranteed that no two mannequins are located in the same point on the plane.OutputPrint a single real number — the value of the sought angle in degrees. The answer will be considered valid if the relative or absolute error doesn't exceed10- 6.ExamplesInput22 00 2Output90.0000000000Input32 00 2-2 2Output135.0000000000Input42 00 2-2 00 -2Output270.0000000000Input22 11 2Output36.8698976458NoteSolution for the first sample test is shown below:Solution for the second sample test is shown below:Solution for the third sample test is shown below:Solution for the fourth sample test is shown below:",
