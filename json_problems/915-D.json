Almost Acyclic Graphtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given adirected graphconsisting ofnvertices andmedges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.Can you make this graphacyclicby removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(2 ≤n≤ 500,1 ≤m≤min(n(n- 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.Thenmlines follow. Each line contains two integersuandvdenoting a directed edge going from vertexuto vertexv(1 ≤u,v≤n,u≠v). Each ordered pair(u,v)is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge fromutov).OutputIf it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, printYES. Otherwise, printNO.ExamplesInput3 41 22 33 23 1OutputYESInput5 61 22 33 23 12 14 5OutputNONoteIn the first example you can remove edge, and the graph becomes acyclic.In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example,and) in order to make the graph acyclic.",
