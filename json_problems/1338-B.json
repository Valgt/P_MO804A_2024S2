You have to assign apositiveweight to each edge so that the following condition would hold:For every two different leaves $$$v_{1}$$$ and $$$v_{2}$$$ of this tree,bitwise XORof weights of all edges on the simple path between $$$v_{1}$$$ and $$$v_{2}$$$ has to be equal to $$$0$$$.Note that you can putvery largepositive integers (like $$$10^{(10^{10})}$$$).It's guaranteed that such assignment always exists under given constraints. Now let's define $$$f$$$ asthe number of distinct weightsin assignment.In this example, assignment is valid, because bitwise XOR of all edge weights between every pair of leaves is $$$0$$$. $$$f$$$ value is $$$2$$$ here, because there are $$$2$$$ distinct edge weights($$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$).In this example, assignment is invalid, because bitwise XOR of all edge weights between vertex $$$1$$$ and vertex $$$6$$$ ($$$3, 4, 5, 4$$$) is not $$$0$$$.What are the minimum and the maximum possible values of $$$f$$$ for the given tree? Find and print both.InputThe first line contains integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{5}$$$) — the number of vertices in given tree.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_{i}$$$ and $$$b_{i}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_{i} \\\\lt b_{i} \\\\le n$$$) — it means there is an edge between $$$a_{i}$$$ and $$$b_{i}$$$. It is guaranteed that given graph forms tree of $$$n$$$ vertices.OutputPrint two integers — the minimum and maximum possible value of $$$f$$$ can be made from valid assignment of given tree. Note that it's always possible to make an assignment under given constraints.ExamplesInput6 1 3 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6Output1 4Input6 1 3 2 3 3 4 4 5 4 6Output3 3Input7 1 2 2 7 3 4 4 7 5 6 6 7Output1 6NoteIn the first example, possible assignments for each minimum and maximum are described in picture below. Of course, there are multiple possible assignments for each minimum and maximum.In the second example, possible assignments for each minimum and maximum are described in picture below. The $$$f$$$ value of valid assignment of this tree is always $$$3$$$.In the third example, possible assignments for each minimum and maximum are described in picture below. Of course, there are multiple possible assignments for each minimum and maximum.",
