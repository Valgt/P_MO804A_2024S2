Calculate the minimum length of the shorter side of the triangle.InputFirst line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$).Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x_i,y_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$).OutputPrint the minimum length of the shorter side of the triangle.
