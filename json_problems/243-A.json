Formally:f(l,r) =al|al+ 1| ...  |ar.Polycarpus took a piece of paper and wrote out the values of functionf(l,r)for alll,r(l,rare integer,1 ≤l≤r≤n). Now he wants to know, how manydistinctvalues he's got in the end.Help Polycarpus, count the number of distinct values of functionf(l,r)for the given sequencea.Expressionx|ymeans applying the operation of bitwise OR to numbersxandy. This operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in languageC++andJavait is marked as \"|\", inPascal— as \"or\".InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105)— the number of elements of sequencea. The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤ 106)— the elements of sequencea.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of distinct values of functionf(l,r)for the given sequencea.Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++.
