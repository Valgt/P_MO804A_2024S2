PermutationForcestime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a permutation $$$p$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.You have a strength of $$$s$$$ and will perform the following operation some times:Choose an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq |p|$$$ and $$$|i-p_i| \\\\leq s$$$.For all $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq |p|$$$ and $$$p_i<p_j$$$, update $$$p_j$$$ to $$$p_j-1$$$.Delete the $$$i$$$-th element from $$$p$$$. Formally, update $$$p$$$ to $$$[p_1,\\\\ldots,p_{i-1},p_{i+1},\\\\ldots,p_n]$$$.It can be shown that no matter what $$$i$$$ you have chosen, $$$p$$$ will be a permutation of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$|p|$$$ after all operations.You want to be able to transform $$$p$$$ into the empty permutation. Find the minimum strength $$$s$$$ that will allow you to do so.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$)  — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$.The second line of input conatains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq p_i \\\\leq n$$$)  — the elements of the permutation $$$p$$$.It is guaranteed that all elements in $$$p$$$ are distinct.OutputPrint the minimum strength $$$s$$$ required.ExamplesInput3 3 2 1Output1Input1 1Output0Input10 1 8 4 3 7 10 6 5 9 2Output1NoteIn the first test case, the minimum $$$s$$$ required is $$$1$$$.Here is how we can transform $$$p$$$ into the empty permutation with $$$s=1$$$:In the first move, you can only choose $$$i=2$$$ as choosing any other value of $$$i$$$ will result in $$$|i-p_i| \\\\leq s$$$ being false. With $$$i=2$$$, $$$p$$$ will be changed to $$$[2,1]$$$.In the second move, you choose $$$i=1$$$, then $$$p$$$ will be changed to $$$[1]$$$.In the third move, you choose $$$i=1$$$, then $$$p$$$ will be changed to $$$[~]$$$.It can be shown that with $$$s=0$$$, it is impossible to transform $$$p$$$ into the empty permutation.",
