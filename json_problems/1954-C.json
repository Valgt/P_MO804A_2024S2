Long Multiplicationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ of the same length, consisting of digits from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$.You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): swap the $$$i$$$-th digit in $$$x$$$ and the $$$i$$$-th digit in $$$y$$$.For example, if $$$x=73$$$ and $$$y=31$$$, you can swap the $$$2$$$-nd digits and get $$$x=71$$$ and $$$y=33$$$.Your task is to maximize the product of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ using the aforementioned operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x < 10^{100}$$$).The second line of each test case contains a single integer $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le y < 10^{100}$$$).Additional constraint on input: the integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ consist only of digits from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$.OutputFor each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number $$$x$$$ after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain the number $$$y$$$ after performing the operations.
