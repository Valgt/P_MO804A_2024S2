Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits4and7. For example, numbers47,744,4are lucky and5,17,467are not.One day Petya was delivered a strings, containing only digits. He needs to find a string thatrepresents a lucky number without leading zeroes,is not empty,is contained insas a substring the maximum number of times.Among all the strings for which the three conditions given above are fulfilled, Petya only needs the lexicographically minimum one. Find this string for Petya.InputThe single line contains a non-empty stringswhose length can range from1to50, inclusive. The string only contains digits. The string can contain leading zeroes.OutputIn the only line print the answer to Petya's problem. If the sought string does not exist, print \"-1\" (without quotes).ExamplesInput047Output4Input16Output-1Input472747Output7NoteThe lexicographical comparison of strings is performed by the < operator in the modern programming languages. Stringxis lexicographically less than stringyeither ifxis a prefix ofy, or exists suchi(1 ≤i≤min(|x|, |y|)), thatxi<yiand for anyj(1 ≤j<i)xj=yj. Here|a|denotes the length of stringa.In the first sample three conditions are fulfilled for strings \"4\", \"7\" and \"47\". The lexicographically minimum one is \"4\".In the second sampleshas no substrings which are lucky numbers.In the third sample the three conditions are only fulfilled for string \"7\".",
