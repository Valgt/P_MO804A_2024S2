Today he came to a store to buy some chocolate. Like all businessmen,Divanknows the value of money, so he will not buy too expensive chocolate. At the same time, too cheap chocolate tastes bad, so he will not buy it as well.The store he came to has $$$n$$$ different chocolate bars, and the price of the $$$i$$$-th chocolate bar is $$$a_i$$$ dollars.Divanconsiders a chocolate bar too expensive if it costs strictly more than $$$r$$$ dollars. Similarly, he considers a bar of chocolate to be too cheap if it costs strictly less than $$$l$$$ dollars. Divan will not buy too cheap or too expensive bars.Divanis not going to spend all his money on chocolate bars, so he will spend at most $$$k$$$ dollars on chocolates.Please determine the maximum number of chocolate barsDivancan buy.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The description of each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the lowest acceptable price of a chocolate, the highest acceptable price of a chocolate and Divan's total budget, respectively.The second line contains a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) integers — the prices of chocolate bars in the store.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the maximum number of chocolate barsDivancan buy.ExampleInput8 3 1 100 100 50 100 50 6 3 5 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 3 5 21 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 50 69 100 20 30 40 77 1 1 12 4 70 10000 3 50 80 30 20 60 70 10 2 7 100 2 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 4 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1 1 1 1 1Output2 2 3 0 0 10 1 1NoteIn the first exampleDivancan buy chocolate bars $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ and spend $$$100$$$ dollars on them.In the second exampleDivancan buy chocolate bars $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ and spend $$$7$$$ dollars on them.In the third exampleDivancan buy chocolate bars $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, and $$$5$$$ for $$$12$$$ dollars.In the fourth exampleDivancannot buy any chocolate bar because each of them is either too cheap or too expensive.In the fifth exampleDivancannot buy any chocolate bar because he considers the first bar too cheap, and has no budget for the second or third.In the sixth exampleDivancan buy all the chocolate bars in the shop.",
