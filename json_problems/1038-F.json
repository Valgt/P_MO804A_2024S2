Wrap Aroundtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a binary string $$$s$$$.Find the number of distinctcyclicalbinary strings of length $$$n$$$ which contain $$$s$$$ as a substring.The cyclical string $$$t$$$ contains $$$s$$$ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $$$t$$$, such that $$$s$$$ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $$$t$$$.For example, the cyclical string \"000111\" contains substrings \"001\", \"01110\" and \"10\", but doesn't contain \"0110\" and \"10110\".Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considereddifferentcyclical strings.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 40$$$) — the length of the target string $$$t$$$.The next line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le n$$$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $$$t$$$. String $$$s$$$ contains only characters '0' and '1'.OutputPrint the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $$$t$$$, which contain $$$s$$$ as a substring.ExamplesInput20Output3Input41010Output2Input2010101010101010Output962NoteIn the first example, there are three cyclical strings, which contain \"0\" — \"00\", \"01\" and \"10\".In the second example, there are only two such strings — \"1010\", \"0101\".",
