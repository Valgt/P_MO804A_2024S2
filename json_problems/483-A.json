    "statement": "A. Counterexampletime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYour friend has recently learned about coprime numbers. A pair of numbers{a,b}is calledcoprimeif the maximum number that divides bothaandbis equal to one.Your friend often comes up with different statements. He has recently supposed that if the pair(a,b)is coprime and the pair(b,c)is coprime, then the pair(a,c)is coprime.You want to find a counterexample for your friend's statement. Therefore, your task is to find three distinct numbers(a,b,c), for which the statement is false, and the numbers meet the conditionl≤a<b<c≤r.More specifically, you need to find three numbers(a,b,c), such thatl≤a<b<c≤r, pairs(a,b)and(b,c)are coprime, and pair(a,c)is not coprime.InputThe single line contains two positive space-separated integersl,r(1 ≤l≤r≤ 1018;r-l≤ 50).OutputPrint three positive space-separated integersa,b,c— three distinct numbers(a,b,c)that form the counterexample. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. The numbers must be printed in ascending order.If the counterexample does not exist, print the single number -1.ExamplesInput2 4Output2 3 4Input10 11Output-1Input900000000000000009 900000000000000029Output900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021NoteIn the first sample pair(2, 4)is not coprime and pairs(2, 3)and(3, 4)are.In the second sample you cannot form a group of three distinct integers, so the answer is -1.In the third sample it is easy to see that numbers900000000000000009and900000000000000021are divisible by three.",
