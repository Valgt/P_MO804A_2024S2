For example,.First, they choose a decimal numberaconsisting ofndigits that contains at least one digit larger than1. This number may possibly start with leading zeroes. Then they should find maximum positive numberxsatisfying following two conditions:1.xdoesn't contain neither digit0nor digit1.2.=.Help friends find such number.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 15) — the number of digits ina.The second line containsndigits ofa. There is at least one digit inathat is larger than1. Numberamay possibly contain leading zeroes.OutputOutput a maximum possible integer satisfying the conditions above.
