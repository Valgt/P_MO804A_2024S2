Shortest Cycletime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given $$$n$$$ integer numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$. Consider graph on $$$n$$$ nodes, in which nodes $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ ($$$i\\\\neq j$$$) are connected if and only if, $$$a_i$$$ AND $$$a_j\\\\neq 0$$$, where AND denotes thebitwise AND operation.Find the length of the shortest cycle in this graph or determine that it doesn't have cycles at all.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5)$$$ — number of numbers.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integer numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^{18}$$$).OutputIf the graph doesn't have any cycles, output $$$-1$$$. Else output the length of the shortest cycle.ExamplesInput4 3 6 28 9Output4Input5 5 12 9 16 48Output3Input4 1 2 4 8Output-1NoteIn the first example, the shortest cycle is $$$(9, 3, 6, 28)$$$.In the second example, the shortest cycle is $$$(5, 12, 9)$$$.The graph has no cycles in the third example.",
