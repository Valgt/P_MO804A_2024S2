He visits a canteen every day and he has already decided what he will order in each of the followingndays. Prices in the canteen do not change and that means Arseny will spendcirubles during thei-th day.There are1-ruble coins and100-ruble notes in circulation. At this moment, Arseny hasmcoins and a sufficiently large amount of notes (you can assume that he has an infinite amount of them). Arseny loves modern technologies, so he uses his credit card everywhere except the canteen, but he has to pay in cash in the canteen because it does not accept cards.Cashier always asks the student to pay change-free. However, it's not always possible, but Arseny tries to minimize thedissatisfactionof the cashier. Cashier's dissatisfaction for each of the days is determined by the total amount of notes and coins in the change. To be precise, if the cashier gives Arsenyxnotes and coins on thei-th day, his dissatisfaction for this day equalsx·wi. Cashier always gives change using as little coins and notes as possible, he always has enough of them to be able to do this.\"Caution! Angry cashier\"Arseny wants to pay in such a way that the total dissatisfaction of the cashier forndays would be as small as possible. Help him to find out how he needs to pay in each of thendays!Note that Arseny always has enough money to pay, because he has an infinite amount of notes. Arseny can use notes and coins he received in change during any of the following days.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 105,0 ≤m≤ 109) — the amount of days Arseny planned his actions for and the amount of coins he currently has.The second line contains a sequence of integersc1,c2, ...,cn(1 ≤ci≤ 105) — the amounts of money in rubles which Arseny is going to spend for each of the following days.The third line contains a sequence of integersw1,w2, ...,wn(1 ≤wi≤ 105) — the cashier's dissatisfaction coefficients for each of the following days.OutputIn the first line print one integer — minimum possible total dissatisfaction of the cashier.Then printnlines, thei-th of then should contain two numbers — the amount of notes and the amount of coins which Arseny should use to pay in the canteen on thei-th day.Of course, the total amount of money Arseny gives to the casher in any of the days should be no less than the amount of money he has planned to spend. It also shouldn't exceed106rubles: Arseny never carries large sums of money with him.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput5 42117 71 150 243 2001 1 1 1 1Output791 171 02 02 432 0Input3 0100 50 501 3 2Output1501 01 00 50Input5 42117 71 150 243 2005 4 3 2 1Output2301 171 01 503 02 0",
