Cirno's Perfect Bitmasks Classroomtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEven if it's a really easy question, she won't be able to answer it—Perfect Memento in Strict SenseCirno's perfect bitmasks classroom has just started!Cirno gave her students a positive integer $$$x$$$. As an assignment, her students need to find theminimum positiveinteger $$$y$$$, which satisfies the following two conditions:$$$$$$x\\\\ \\\\texttt{and}\\\\ y > 0$$$$$$ $$$$$$x\\\\ \\\\texttt{xor}\\\\ y > 0$$$$$$Where $$$\\\\texttt{and}$$$ is thebitwise AND operation, and $$$\\\\texttt{xor}$$$ is thebitwise XOR operation.Among the students was Mystia, who was truly baffled by all these new operators. Please help her!InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of input test cases.For each test case, the only line of input contains one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 2^{30}$$$).OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of $$$y$$$.ExampleInput71259161145141000000Output3 3 1 1 17 2 64NoteTest case 1:$$$1\\\\; \\\\texttt{and}\\\\; 3=1>0$$$, $$$1\\\\; \\\\texttt{xor}\\\\; 3=2>0$$$.Test case 2:$$$2\\\\; \\\\texttt{and}\\\\; 3=2>0$$$, $$$2\\\\; \\\\texttt{xor}\\\\; 3=1>0$$$.",
