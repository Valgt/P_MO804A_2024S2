A single match is played according to the following rules: a match consists of multiple sets, each set consists of multiple serves. Each serve is won by one of the players, this player scores one point. As soon as one of the players scorestpoints, he wins the set; then the next set starts and scores of both players are being set to 0. As soon as one of the players wins the total ofssets, he wins the match and the match is over. Heresandtare some positive integer numbers.To spice it up, Petya and Gena choose new numberssandtbefore every match. Besides, for the sake of history they keep a record of each match: that is, for each serve they write down the winner. Serve winners are recorded in the chronological order. In a record the set is over as soon as one of the players scorestpoints and the match is over as soon as one of the players winsssets.Petya and Gena have found a record of an old match. Unfortunately, the sequence of serves in the record isn't divided into sets and numberssandtfor the given match are also lost. The players now wonder what values ofsandtmight be. Can you determine all the possible options?InputThe first line contains a single integern— the length of the sequence of games (1 ≤n≤ 105).The second line containsnspace-separated integersai. Ifai= 1, then thei-th serve was won by Petya, ifai= 2, then thei-th serve was won by Gena.It is not guaranteedthat at least one option for numberssandtcorresponds to the given record.OutputIn the first line print a single numberk— the number of options for numberssandt.In each of the followingklines print two integerssiandti— the option for numberssandt. Print the options in the order of increasingsi, and for equalsi— in the order of increasingti.ExamplesInput51 2 1 2 1Output21 33 1Input41 1 1 1Output31 42 24 1Input41 2 1 2Output0Input82 1 2 1 1 1 1 1Output31 62 36 1",
