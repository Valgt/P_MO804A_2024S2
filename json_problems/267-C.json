The capital of Berland consists ofnjunctions andmroads. Each road connects a pair of junctions. There can be multiple roads between a pair of junctions. For each road we know its capacity: valueciis the maximum number of cars that can drive along a road in any direction per a unit of time. For each road, the cars can drive along it in one of two direction. That it, the cars can't simultaneously move in both directions. A road's traffic is the number of cars that goes along it per a unit of time. For road (ai,bi) this value is negative, if the traffic moves frombitoai. A road's traffic can be a non-integer number.The capital has two special junctions — the entrance to the city (junction 1) and the exit from the city (junctionn). For all other junctions it is true that the traffic is not lost there. That is, for all junctions except for 1 andnthe incoming traffic sum equals the outgoing traffic sum.Traffic has an unusual peculiarity in the capital of Berland — for any pair of junctions (x,y) the sum of traffics along any path fromxtoydoesn't change depending on the choice of the path. Such sum includes traffic along all roads on the path (possible with the \"minus\" sign, if the traffic along the road is directed against the direction of the road on the path fromxtoy).Your task is to find the largest traffic that can pass trough the city per one unit of time as well as the corresponding traffic for each road.InputThe first line contains a positive integern— the number of junctions (2 ≤n≤ 100). The second line contains integerm(1 ≤m≤ 5000) — the number of roads. Nextmlines contain the roads' descriptions. Each road contains a group of three numbersai,bi,ci, whereai,biare the numbers of junctions, connected by the given road, andci(1 ≤ai,bi≤n;ai≠bi;0 ≤ci≤ 10000) is the largest permissible traffic along this road.OutputIn the first line print the required largest traffic across the city. Then printmlines, on each line print the speed, at which the traffic moves along the corresponding road. If the direction doesn't match the order of the junctions, given in the input, then print the traffic with the minus sign. Print the numbers with accuracy of at least five digits after the decimal point.If there are many optimal solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput231 2 21 2 42 1 1000Output6.000002.000002.00000-2.00000Input7111 2 71 2 71 3 71 4 72 3 72 5 73 6 74 7 75 4 75 6 76 7 7Output13.000002.000002.000003.000006.000001.000003.000004.000007.000001.000002.000006.00000",
