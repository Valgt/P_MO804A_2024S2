You are asked to process $$$q$$$ queries of the following format: given integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$, multiply $$$a_i$$$ by $$$x$$$.After processing each query you need to output thegreatest common divisor (GCD)of all elements of the array $$$a$$$.Since the answer can be too large, you are asked to output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers — $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$ before the changes.The next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries in the following format: each line contains two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$, $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines: after processing each query output the GCD of all elements modulo $$$10^9+7$$$ on a separate line.ExampleInput4 3 1 6 8 12 1 12 2 3 3 3Output2 2 6NoteAfter the first query the array is $$$[12, 6, 8, 12]$$$, $$$\\\\operatorname{gcd}(12, 6, 8, 12) = 2$$$.After the second query — $$$[12, 18, 8, 12]$$$, $$$\\\\operatorname{gcd}(12, 18, 8, 12) = 2$$$.After the third query — $$$[12, 18, 24, 12]$$$, $$$\\\\operatorname{gcd}(12, 18, 24, 12) = 6$$$.Here the $$$\\\\operatorname{gcd}$$$ function denotes the greatest common divisor.",
