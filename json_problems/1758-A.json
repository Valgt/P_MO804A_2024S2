For example, the strings $$$\\\\texttt{z}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{aaa}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{aba}$$$, and $$$\\\\texttt{abccba}$$$ are palindromes, but $$$\\\\texttt{codeforces}$$$ and $$$\\\\texttt{ab}$$$ are not.Thedoubleof a string $$$s$$$ is obtained by writing each character twice. For example, the double of $$$\\\\texttt{seeing}$$$ is $$$\\\\texttt{sseeeeiinngg}$$$.Given a string $$$s$$$, rearrange its double to form a palindrome. Output the rearranged string. It can be proven that such a rearrangement always exists.InputThe first line of input contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq |s| \\\\leq 100$$$) consisting only of lowercase English letters.Note that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases is not bounded.OutputFor each test case, output a palindromic string of length $$$2 \\\\cdot |s|$$$ that is a rearrangement of the double of $$$s$$$.ExampleInput4asururuerrorgornanutforajaroftunaOutputaa suurruurruus rgnororerrerorongr aannuuttffoorraajjaarrooffttuunnaaNoteIn the first test case, the double of $$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$ is $$$\\\\texttt{aa}$$$, which is already a palindrome.In the second test case, the double of $$$\\\\texttt{sururu}$$$ is $$$\\\\texttt{ssuurruurruu}$$$.
