Your goal is to reach the point $$$n$$$. In one minute, you can move by $$$2$$$ or by $$$3$$$ to the left or to the right (i. e., if your current coordinate is $$$x$$$, it can become $$$x-3$$$, $$$x-2$$$, $$$x+2$$$ or $$$x+3$$$). Note that the new coordinate can become negative.Your task is to find theminimumnumber of minutes required to get from the point $$$0$$$ to the point $$$n$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ lines describing the test cases follow.The $$$i$$$-th of these lines contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the goal of the $$$i$$$-th test case.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — theminimumnumber of minutes required to get from the point $$$0$$$ to the point $$$n$$$ for the corresponding test case.ExampleInput413412Output2 1 2 4",
