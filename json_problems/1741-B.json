Funny Permutationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA sequence of $$$n$$$ numbers is calledpermutationif it contains all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once. For example, the sequences $$$[3, 1, 4, 2]$$$, [$$$1$$$] and $$$[2,1]$$$ are permutations, but $$$[1,2,1]$$$, $$$[0,1]$$$ and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ are not.For a given number $$$n$$$ you need to make a permutation $$$p$$$ such that two requirements are satisfied at the same time:For each element $$$p_i$$$, at least one of its neighbors has a value that differs from the value of $$$p_i$$$ by one. That is, for each element $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$), at least one of its neighboring elements (standing to the left or right of $$$p_i$$$) must be $$$p_i + 1$$$, or $$$p_i - 1$$$.the permutation must have no fixed points. That is, for every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$), $$$p_i \\\\neq i$$$ must be satisfied.Let's call the permutation that satisfies these requirementsfunny.For example, let $$$n = 4$$$. Then [$$$4, 3, 1, 2$$$] is afunnypermutation, since:to the right of $$$p_1=4$$$ is $$$p_2=p_1-1=4-1=3$$$;to the left of $$$p_2=3$$$ is $$$p_1=p_2+1=3+1=4$$$;to the right of $$$p_3=1$$$ is $$$p_4=p_3+1=1+1=2$$$;to the left of $$$p_4=2$$$ is $$$p_3=p_4-1=2-1=1$$$.for all $$$i$$$ is $$$p_i \\\\ne i$$$.For a given positive integer $$$n$$$, outputanyfunnypermutation of length $$$n$$$, or output-1iffunnypermutation of length $$$n$$$ does not exist.InputThe first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The description of the test cases follows.Each test case consists of f single line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print on a separate line:anyfunnypermutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$;or the number-1if the permutation you are looking for does not exist.ExampleInput543752Output3 4 2 1 -1 6 7 4 5 3 2 1 5 4 1 2 3 2 1NoteThe first test case is explained in the problem statement.In the second test case, it is not possible to make the required permutation: permutations $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 3]$$$, $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$ have fixed points, and in $$$[2, 3, 1]$$$ and $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$ the first condition is met not for all positions.",
