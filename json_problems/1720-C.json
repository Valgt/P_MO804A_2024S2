Each cell of this matrix contains $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.Let's call a square of size $$$2 \\\\times 2$$$ without one corner cell an L-shape figure. In one operation you can take one L-shape figure, with at least one cell containing $$$1$$$ and replace all numbers in it with zeroes.Find themaximumnumber of operations that you can do with the given matrix.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 500$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of each test case.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n, m \\\\leq 500$$$) — the size of the matrix.Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains a binary string of length $$$m$$$ — the description of the matrix.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.OutputFor each test case output the maximum number of operations you can do with the given matrix.ExampleInput44 31011110111103 41110011101112 200002 21111Output8 9 0 2NoteIn the first testcase one of the optimal sequences of operations is the following (bold font shows l-shape figure on which operation was performed):Matrix before any operation was performed:101111011110Matrix after $$$1$$$ operation was performed:100101011110Matrix after $$$2$$$ operations were performed:100100011110Matrix after $$$3$$$ operations were performed:100100010110Matrix after $$$4$$$ operations were performed:100000010110Matrix after $$$5$$$ operations were performed:100000010100Matrix after $$$6$$$ operations were performed:100000000100Matrix after $$$7$$$ operations were performed:000000000100Matrix after $$$8$$$ operations were performed:000000000000In the third testcase from the sample we can not perform any operation because the matrix doesn't contain any ones.In the fourth testcase it does not matter which L-shape figure we pick in our first operation. We will always be left with single one. So we will perform $$$2$$$ operations.",
