Each multiset has exactlynintegers each between1andninclusive. Multisets may contain multiple copies of the same number.You would like to find a nonempty subset ofAand a nonempty subset ofBsuch that the sum of elements in these subsets are equal. Subsets are also multisets, i.e. they can contain elements with equal values.If no solution exists, print- 1. Otherwise, print the indices of elements in any such subsets ofAandBthat have the same sum.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 1 000 000) — the size of both multisets.The second line containsnintegers, denoting the elements ofA. Each element will be between1andninclusive.The third line containsnintegers, denoting the elements ofB. Each element will be between1andninclusive.OutputIf there is no solution, print a single integer- 1. Otherwise, your solution should be printed on four lines.The first line should contain a single integerka, the size of the corresponding subset ofA. The second line should containkadistinct integers, the indices of the subset ofA.The third line should contain a single integerkb, the size of the corresponding subset ofB. The fourth line should containkbdistinct integers, the indices of the subset ofB.Elements in both sets are numbered from1ton. If there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput1010 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 1010 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1Output1235 8 10Input54 4 3 3 32 2 2 2 5Output22 323 5",
