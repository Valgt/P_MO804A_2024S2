Nearest Beautiful Number (easy version)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt is a simplified version of problem F2. The difference between them is the constraints (F1: $$$k \\\\le 2$$$, F2: $$$k \\\\le 10$$$).You are given an integer $$$n$$$. Find the minimum integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$x \\\\ge n$$$ and the number $$$x$$$ is $$$k$$$-beautiful.A number is called $$$k$$$-beautifulif its decimal representation having no leading zeroes contains no more than $$$k$$$ different digits. E.g. if $$$k = 2$$$, the numbers $$$3434443$$$, $$$55550$$$, $$$777$$$ and $$$21$$$ are $$$k$$$-beautifulwhereas the numbers $$$120$$$, $$$445435$$$ and $$$998244353$$$ are not.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 2$$$).OutputFor each test case output on a separate line $$$x$$$ — the minimum $$$k$$$-beautifulinteger such that $$$x \\\\ge n$$$.ExampleInput4 1 1 221 2 177890 2 998244353 1Output1 221 181111 999999999",
