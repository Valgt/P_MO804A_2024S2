Range Sorting (Hard Version)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe only difference between this problem and the easy version is the constraints on $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$.You are given an array $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$.Define thebeautyof an array $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots p_k$$$ as the minimum amount of time needed to sort this array using an arbitrary number ofrange-sortoperations. In each range-sort operation, you will do the following:Choose two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l < r \\\\le k$$$).Sort the subarray $$$p_l, p_{l + 1}, \\\\ldots, p_r$$$ in $$$r - l$$$ seconds.Please calculate the sum of beauty over all subarrays of array $$$a$$$.A subarray of an array is defined as a sequence of consecutive elements of the array.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case consists of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le a_i\\\\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that all elements of $$$a$$$ are pairwise distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the sum of beauty over all subarrays of array $$$a$$$.ExampleInput526 433 10 644 8 7 259 8 2 4 6122 6 13 3 15 5 10 8 16 9 11 18Output1 2 8 16 232NoteIn the first test case:The subarray $$$[6]$$$ is already sorted, so its beauty is $$$0$$$.The subarray $$$[4]$$$ is already sorted, so its beauty is $$$0$$$.You can sort the subarray $$$[6, 4]$$$ in one operation by choosing $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 2$$$. Its beauty is equal to $$$1$$$.The sum of beauty over all subarrays of the given array is equal to $$$0 + 0 + 1 = 1$$$.In the second test case:The subarray $$$[3]$$$ is already sorted, so its beauty is $$$0$$$.The subarray $$$[10]$$$ is already sorted, so its beauty is $$$0$$$.The subarray $$$[6]$$$ is already sorted, so its beauty is $$$0$$$.The subarray $$$[3, 10]$$$ is already sorted, so its beauty is $$$0$$$.You can sort the subarray $$$[10, 6]$$$ in one operation by choosing $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 2$$$. Its beauty is equal to $$$2 - 1 = 1$$$.You can sort the subarray $$$[3, 10, 6]$$$ in one operation by choosing $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 3$$$. Its beauty is equal to $$$3 - 2 = 1$$$.The sum of beauty over all subarrays of the given array is equal to $$$0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2$$$.",
