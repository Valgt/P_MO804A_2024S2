The following operation is performed with this line exactly once:A line is split intoat mostknon-empty substrings, i.e. stringsis represented as a concatenation of a set of stringss=t1+t2+ ... +tm,1 ≤m≤k.Some of stringstiare replaced by stringstir, that is, their record from right to left.The lines are concatenated back in the same order, we get strings' =t'1t'2...t'm, wheret'iequalstiortir.Your task is to determine the lexicographically smallest string that could be the result of applying the given operation to the strings.InputThe first line of the input contains strings(1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5 000 000), consisting of lowercase English letters. The second line contains integerk(1 ≤k≤ |s|) — the maximum number of parts in the partition.OutputIn the single line print the lexicographically minimum strings'which can be obtained as a result of performing the described operation.ExamplesInputaba2OutputaabInputaaaabacaba2OutputaaaaabacabInputbababa1OutputabababInputabacabadabacaba4Outputaababacabacabad",
