    "statement": "E. Gregor and the Two Painterstime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTwo painters, Amin and Benj, are repainting Gregor's living room ceiling! The ceiling can be modeled as an $$$n \\\\times m$$$ grid.For each $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive, painter Amin applies $$$a_i$$$ layers of paint to the entire $$$i$$$-th row. For each $$$j$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$, inclusive, painter Benj applies $$$b_j$$$ layers of paint to the entire $$$j$$$-th column. Therefore, the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ ends up with $$$a_i+b_j$$$ layers of paint.Gregor considers the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ to bebadly paintedif $$$a_i+b_j \\\\le x$$$. Define abadly painted regionto be amaximalconnected component of badly painted cells, i. e. a connected component of badly painted cells such that all adjacent to the component cells are not badly painted. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.Gregor is appalled by the state of the finished ceiling, and wants to know the number of badly painted regions.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n,m \\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the dimensions of Gregor's ceiling, and the maximum number of paint layers in a badly painted cell.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$), the number of paint layers Amin applies to each row.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_j \\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$), the number of paint layers Benj applies to each column.OutputPrint a single integer, the number of badly painted regions.ExamplesInput3 4 11 9 8 5 10 6 7 2Output2Input3 4 12 9 8 5 10 6 7 2Output1Input3 3 2 1 2 1 1 2 1Output4Input5 23 6 1 4 3 5 2 2 3 1 6 1 5 5 6 1 3 2 6 2 3 1 6 1 4 1 6 1 5 5Output6NoteThe diagram below represents the first example. The numbers to the left of each row represent the list $$$a$$$, and the numbers above each column represent the list $$$b$$$. The numbers inside each cell represent the number of paint layers in that cell.The colored cells correspond to badly painted cells. The red and blue cells respectively form $$$2$$$ badly painted regions.",
