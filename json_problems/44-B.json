Colatime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutTo celebrate the opening of the Winter Computer School the organizers decided to buy innliters of cola. However, an unexpected difficulty occurred in the shop: it turned out that cola is sold in bottles0.5,1and2liters in volume. At that, there are exactlyabottles0.5in volume,bone-liter bottles andcof two-liter ones. The organizers have enough money to buy any amount of cola. What did cause the heated arguments was how many bottles of every kind to buy, as this question is pivotal for the distribution of cola among the participants (and organizers as well).Thus, while the organizers are having the argument, discussing different variants of buying cola, the Winter School can't start. Your task is to count the number of all the possible ways to buy exactlynliters of cola and persuade the organizers that this number is too large, and if they keep on arguing, then the Winter Computer School will have to be organized in summer.All the bottles of cola are considered indistinguishable, i.e. two variants of buying are different from each other only if they differ in the number of bottles of at least one kind.InputThe first line contains four integers —n,a,b,c(1 ≤n≤ 10000,0 ≤a,b,c≤ 5000).OutputPrint the unique number — the solution to the problem. If it is impossible to buy exactlynliters of cola, print0.ExamplesInput10 5 5 5Output9Input3 0 0 2Output0",
