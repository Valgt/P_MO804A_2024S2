For each pie you pay full price for, you may select one pie of a strictly lesser value to get for free. Given the prices of all the pies you wish to acquire, determine the minimum total amount you must pay for all of the pies.InputInput will begin with an integern(1 ≤n≤ 500000), the number of pies you wish to acquire. Following this is a line withnintegers, each indicating the cost of a pie. All costs are positive integers not exceeding109.OutputPrint the minimum cost to acquire all the pies.Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++.
