He wants to solve $$$s$$$ problems in $$$n$$$ days. Let $$$a_i$$$ be the number of problems he solves during the $$$i$$$-th day. He wants to find a distribution of problems into days such that:$$$a_i$$$ is an integer value for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$;$$$a_i \\\\ge 1$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$;$$$a_{i + 1} \\\\ge a_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$;$$$a_{i + 1} \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot a_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$;$$$a_n$$$ is maximized.Note that $$$a_1$$$ can be arbitrarily large.What is the largest value of $$$a_n$$$ Polycarp can obtain?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases.Then the descriptions of $$$t$$$ testcases follow.The only line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le s \\\\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of days and the number of problems Polycarp wants to solve.It's guaranteed that the distribution always exists within the given constraints.OutputFor each testcase print a single integer — the maximum value of $$$a_n$$$.ExampleInput3 1 15 3 9 2 6Output15 4 4NoteIn the first testcase there is only one distribution: $$$[15]$$$.In the second testcase the distribution that maximizes $$$a_n$$$ is: $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$.In the third testcase the distribution that maximizes $$$a_n$$$ is: $$$[2, 4]$$$. $$$[3, 3]$$$ is a valid distribution but $$$a_n=3$$$ which is smaller than $$$4$$$. $$$[1, 5]$$$ is not a valid distribution because $$$5 > 2 \\\\cdot 1$$$.",
