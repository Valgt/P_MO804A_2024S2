Interesting Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutWe'll call an array ofnnon-negative integersa[1],a[2], ...,a[n]interesting, if it meetsmconstraints. Thei-th of themconstraints consists of three integersli,ri,qi(1 ≤li≤ri≤n) meaning that valueshould be equal toqi.Your task is to find anyinterestingarray ofnelements or state that such array doesn't exist.Expressionx&ymeans the bitwise AND of numbersxandy. In programming languages C++, Java and Python this operation is represented as \"&\", in Pascal — as \"and\".InputThe first line contains two integersn,m(1 ≤n≤ 105,1 ≤m≤ 105) — the number of elements in the array and the number of limits.Each of the nextmlines contains three integersli,ri,qi(1 ≤li≤ri≤n,0 ≤qi< 230) describing thei-th limit.OutputIf theinterestingarray exists, in the first line print \"YES\" (without the quotes) and in the second line printnintegersa[1],a[2], ...,a[n](0 ≤a[i] < 230) decribing theinterestingarray. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.If theinterestingarray doesn't exist, print \"NO\" (without the quotes) in the single line.ExamplesInput3 11 3 3OutputYES3 3 3Input3 21 3 31 3 2OutputNO",
