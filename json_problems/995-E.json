Number Clickertime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAllen is playing Number Clicker on his phone.He starts with an integer $$$u$$$ on the screen. Every second, he can press one of 3 buttons.Turn $$$u \\\\to u+1 \\\\pmod{p}$$$.Turn $$$u \\\\to u+p-1 \\\\pmod{p}$$$.Turn $$$u \\\\to u^{p-2} \\\\pmod{p}$$$.Allen wants to press at most 200 buttons and end up with $$$v$$$ on the screen. Help him!InputThe first line of the input contains 3 positive integers: $$$u, v, p$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le u, v \\\\le p-1$$$, $$$3 \\\\le p \\\\le 10^9 + 9$$$). $$$p$$$ is guaranteed to be prime.OutputOn the first line, print a single integer $$$\\\\ell$$$, the number of button presses. On the second line, print integers $$$c_1, \\\\dots, c_\\\\ell$$$, the button presses. For $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le \\\\ell$$$, $$$1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le 3$$$.We can show that the answer always exists.ExamplesInput1 3 5Output21 1Input3 2 5Output13NoteIn the first example the integer on the screen changes as $$$1 \\\\to 2 \\\\to 3$$$.In the second example the integer on the screen changes as $$$3 \\\\to 2$$$.",
