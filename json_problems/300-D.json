The table has got a black border around this table.The example of the initial table atn= 5.Vasily the bear wants to paint his square table in exactlykmoves. Each move is sequence of actions:The bear chooses some square inside his table. At that the square must have a black border painted around it. Also, the square shouldn't contain a black cell. The number of cells in the square shouldn't be less than2.The bear chooses some row and some column inside the chosen square. Then he paints each cell of this row and this column inside the chosen square. After that the rectangles, formed by the square's border and the newly painted cells, must be squares of a non-zero area.An example of correct painting atn= 7 иk= 2.The bear already knows numbersnandk. Help him — find the number of ways to paint the square in exactlykmoves. Two ways to paint are called distinct if the resulting tables will differ in at least one cell. As the answer can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing it by7340033.InputThe first line contains integerq(1 ≤q≤ 105)— the number of test data.Each of the followingqlines contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 109, 0 ≤k≤ 1000)— the size of the initial table and the number of moves for the corresponding test.OutputFor each test from the input print the answer to the problem modulo7340033.
