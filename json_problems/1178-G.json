    "statement": "G. The Awesomest Vertextime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a rooted tree on $$$n$$$ vertices. The vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$; the root is the vertex number $$$1$$$.Each vertex has two integers associated with it: $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. We denote the set of all ancestors of $$$v$$$ (including $$$v$$$ itself) by $$$R(v)$$$. Theawesomenessof a vertex $$$v$$$ is defined as$$$$$$\\\\left| \\\\sum_{w \\\\in R(v)} a_w\\\\right| \\\\cdot \\\\left|\\\\sum_{w \\\\in R(v)} b_w\\\\right|,$$$$$$where $$$|x|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$x$$$.Process $$$q$$$ queries of one of the following forms:1 v x— increase $$$a_v$$$ by a positive integer $$$x$$$.2 v— report the maximumawesomenessin the subtree of vertex $$$v$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot 10^5, 1 \\\\leq q \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries, respectively.The second line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\\\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq p_i < i$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ means that there is an edge between vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$p_i$$$.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-5000 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 5000$$$), the initial values of $$$a_i$$$ for each vertex.The fourth line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$-5000 \\\\leq b_i \\\\leq 5000$$$), the values of $$$b_i$$$ for each vertex.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines describes a query. It has one of the following forms:1 v x($$$1 \\\\leq v \\\\leq n$$$, $$$1\\\\leq x \\\\leq 5000$$$).2 v($$$1 \\\\leq v \\\\leq n$$$).OutputFor each query of the second type, print a single line with the maximumawesomenessin the respective subtree.ExampleInput5 61 1 2 210 -3 -7 -3 -1010 3 9 3 62 12 21 2 62 11 2 52 1Output10091169240NoteThe initialawesomenessof the vertices is $$$[100, 91, 57, 64, 57]$$$. The mostawesomevertex in the subtree of vertex $$$1$$$ (the first query) is $$$1$$$, and the mostawesomevertex in the subtree of vertex $$$2$$$ (the second query) is $$$2$$$.After the first update (the third query), theawesomenesschanges to $$$[100, 169, 57, 160, 57]$$$ and thus the mostawesomevertex in the whole tree (the fourth query) is now $$$2$$$.After the second update (the fifth query), theawesomenessbecomes $$$[100, 234, 57, 240, 152]$$$, hence the mostawesomevertex (the sixth query) is now $$$4$$$.",
