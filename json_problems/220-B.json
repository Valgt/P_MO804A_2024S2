He has arraya, consisting ofnpositive integers, indexed from 1 ton. Let's denote the number with indexiasai.Additionally the Little Elephant hasmqueries to the array, each query is characterised by a pair of integersljandrj(1 ≤lj≤rj≤n). For each querylj,rjthe Little Elephant has to count, how many numbersxexist, such that numberxoccurs exactlyxtimes among numbersalj,alj+ 1, ...,arj.Help the Little Elephant to count the answers to all queries.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 105)— the size of arrayaand the number of queries to it. The next line containsnspace-separated positive integersa1,a2,...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109). Nextmlines contain descriptions of queries, one per line.
