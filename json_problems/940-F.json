Where is it coming from?You are given an arraya. You have to answer the following queries:You are given two integerslandr. Letcibe the number of occurrences ofiinal:r, whereal:ris the subarray ofafroml-th element tor-th inclusive. Find theMexof{c0,c1, ...,c109}You are given two integersptox. Changeaptox.TheMexof a multiset of numbers is the smallest non-negative integernot inthe set.Note that in this problem all elements ofaare positive, which means thatc0= 0 and0is never the answer for the query of the second type.InputThe first line of input contains two integersnandq(1 ≤n,q≤ 100 000) — the length of the array and the number of queries respectively.The second line of input containsnintegers —a1,a2,...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109).Each of the nextqlines describes a single query.The first type of query is described by three integersti= 1,li,ri, where1 ≤li≤ri≤n— the bounds of the subarray.The second type of query is described by three integersti= 2,pi,xi, where1 ≤pi≤nis the index of the element, which must be changed and1 ≤xi≤ 109is the new value.OutputFor each query of the first type output a single integer  — theMexof{c0,c1, ...,c109}.ExampleInput10 41 2 3 1 1 2 2 2 9 91 1 11 2 82 7 11 2 8Output232NoteThe subarray of the first query consists of the single element —1.The subarray of the second query consists of four2s, one3and two1s.The subarray of the fourth query consists of three1s, three2s and one3.",
