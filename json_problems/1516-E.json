Baby Ehab Plays with Permutationstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis time around, Baby Ehab will play with permutations. He has $$$n$$$ cubes arranged in a row, with numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ written on them. He'll makeexactly$$$j$$$ operations. In each operation, he'll pick up $$$2$$$ cubes and switch their positions.He's wondering: how many different sequences of cubes can I have at the end? Since Baby Ehab is a turbulent person, he doesn't know how many operations he'll make, so he wants the answer for every possible $$$j$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$.InputThe only line contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 200$$$) — the number of cubes Baby Ehab has, and the parameter $$$k$$$ from the statement.OutputPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers. The $$$i$$$-th of them is the number of possible sequences you can end up with if you do exactly $$$i$$$ operations. Since this number can be very large, print the remainder when it's divided by $$$10^9+7$$$.ExamplesInput2 3Output1 1 1Input3 2Output3 3Input4 2Output6 12NoteIn the second example, there are $$$3$$$ sequences he can get after $$$1$$$ swap, because there are $$$3$$$ pairs of cubes he can swap. Also, there are $$$3$$$ sequences he can get after $$$2$$$ swaps:$$$[1,2,3]$$$,$$$[3,1,2]$$$,$$$[2,3,1]$$$.",
