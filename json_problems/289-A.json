Polo the Penguin and Segmentstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLittle penguin Polo adores integer segments, that is, pairs of integers[l;r](l≤r).He has a set that consists ofninteger segments:[l1;r1], [l2;r2], ..., [ln;rn]. We know that no two segments of this set intersect. In one move Polo can either widen any segment of the set 1 unit to the left or 1 unit to the right, that is transform[l;r]to either segment[l- 1;r], or to segment[l;r+ 1].Thevalueof a set of segments that consists ofnsegments[l1;r1], [l2;r2], ..., [ln;rn]is the number of integersx, such that there is integerj, for which the following inequality holds,lj≤x≤rj.Find the minimum number of moves needed to make the value of the set of Polo's segments divisible byk.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n,k≤ 105). Each of the followingnlines contain a segment as a pair of integersliandri(- 105≤li≤ri≤ 105), separated by a space.It is guaranteed that no two segments intersect. In other words, for any two integersi,j(1 ≤i<j≤n)the following inequality holds,min(ri,rj) <max(li,lj).OutputIn a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput2 31 23 4Output2Input3 71 23 34 7Output0",
