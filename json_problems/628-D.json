    "statement": "D. Magic Numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputConsider the decimal presentation of an integer. Let's call a numberd-magicif digitdappears in decimal presentation of the number on even positions and nowhere else.For example, the numbers1727374,17,1are7-magicbut77,7,123,34,71are not7-magic. On the other hand the number7is0-magic,123is2-magic,34is4-magicand71is1-magic.Find the number ofd-magicnumbers in the segment[a,b]that are multiple ofm. Because the answer can be very huge you should only find its value modulo109+ 7(so you should find the remainder after dividing by109+ 7).InputThe first line contains two integersm,d(1 ≤m≤ 2000,0 ≤d≤ 9) — the parameters from the problem statement.The second line contains positive integerain decimal presentation (without leading zeroes).The third line contains positive integerbin decimal presentation (without leading zeroes).It is guaranteed thata≤b, the number of digits inaandbare the same and don't exceed2000.OutputPrint the only integera— the remainder after dividing by109+ 7of the number ofd-magicnumbers in segment[a,b]that are multiple ofm.ExamplesInput2 61099Output8Input2 019Output4Input19 710009999Output6NoteThe numbers from the answer of the first example are16,26,36,46,56,76,86and96.The numbers from the answer of the second example are2,4,6and8.The numbers from the answer of the third example are1767,2717,5757,6707,8797and9747.",
