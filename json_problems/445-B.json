DZY Loves Chemistrytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutDZY loves chemistry, and he enjoys mixing chemicals.DZY hasnchemicals, andmpairs of them will react. He wants to pour these chemicals into a test tube, and he needs to pour them in one by one, in any order.Let's consider the danger of a test tube. Danger of an empty test tube is1. And every time when DZY pours a chemical, if there are already one or more chemicals in the test tube that can react with it, the danger of the test tube will be multiplied by2. Otherwise the danger remains as it is.Find the maximum possible danger after pouring all the chemicals one by one in optimal order.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandm.Each of the nextmlines contains two space-separated integersxiandyi(1 ≤xi<yi≤n). These integers mean that the chemicalxiwill react with the chemicalyi. Each pair of chemicals will appear at most once in the input.Consider all the chemicals numbered from1tonin some order.OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum possible danger.ExamplesInput1 0Output1Input2 11 2Output2Input3 21 22 3Output4NoteIn the first sample, there's only one way to pour, and the danger won't increase.In the second sample, no matter we pour the1st chemical first, or pour the2nd chemical first, the answer is always2.In the third sample, there are four ways to achieve the maximum possible danger: 2-1-3, 2-3-1, 1-2-3 and 3-2-1 (that is the numbers of the chemicals in order of pouring).",
