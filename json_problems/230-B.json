T-primestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutWe know that prime numbers are positive integers that have exactly two distinct positive divisors. Similarly, we'll call a positive integertТ-prime, ifthas exactly three distinct positive divisors.You are given an array ofnpositive integers. For each of them determine whether it is Т-prime or not.InputThe first line contains a single positive integer,n(1 ≤n≤ 105), showing how many numbers are in the array. The next line containsnspace-separated integersxi(1 ≤xi≤ 1012).Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is advised to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.OutputPrintnlines: thei-th line should contain \"YES\" (without the quotes), if numberxiis Т-prime, and \"NO\" (without the quotes), if it isn't.ExamplesInput34 5 6OutputYESNONONoteThe given test has three numbers. The first number 4 has exactly three divisors — 1, 2 and 4, thus the answer for this number is \"YES\". The second number 5 has two divisors (1 and 5), and the third number 6 has four divisors (1, 2, 3, 6), hence the answer for them is \"NO\".",
