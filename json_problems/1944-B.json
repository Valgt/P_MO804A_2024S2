Equal XORtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$2n$$$, consisting of each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactlytwice.You are also given an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n}{2} \\\\rfloor $$$).You need to find two arrays $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ each of length $$$\\\\mathbf{2k}$$$ such that:$$$l$$$ is a subset$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ of $$$[a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots a_n]$$$$$$r$$$ is a subset of $$$[a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \\\\ldots a_{2n}]$$$bitwise XORof elements of $$$l$$$ is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of $$$r$$$; in other words, $$$l_1 \\\\oplus l_2 \\\\oplus \\\\ldots \\\\oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \\\\oplus r_2 \\\\oplus \\\\ldots \\\\oplus r_{2k}$$$It can be proved that at least one pair of $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subset of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained by deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of $$$y$$$ and rearranging the elements in any order. For example, $$$[3,1,2,1]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, $$$[1, 1]$$$ and $$$[3, 2]$$$ are subsets of $$$[1, 1, 2, 3]$$$ but $$$[4]$$$ and $$$[2, 2]$$$ are not subsets of $$$[1, 1, 2, 3]$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n}{2} \\\\rfloor $$$).The second line contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{2n}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly twice in $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$.OutputFor each test case, output two lines.On the first line of output, output $$$2k$$$ integers $$$l_1, l_2, \\\\ldots, l_{2k}$$$.On the second line of output, output $$$2k$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \\\\ldots r_{2k}$$$.If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.ExampleInput42 11 2 2 16 16 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 44 11 2 3 4 1 2 3 46 25 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2Output2 1 2 1 6 4 1 3 1 2 1 2 5 1 3 3 6 4 2 4NoteIn the first test case, we choose $$$l=[2,1]$$$ and $$$r=[2,1]$$$. $$$[2, 1]$$$ is a subset of $$$[a_1, a_2]$$$ and $$$[2, 1]$$$ is a subset of $$$[a_3, a_4]$$$, and $$$2 \\\\oplus 1 = 2 \\\\oplus 1 = 3$$$.In the second test case, $$$6 \\\\oplus 4 = 1 \\\\oplus 3 = 2$$$.",
