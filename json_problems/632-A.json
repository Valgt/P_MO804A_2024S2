    "statement": "A. Grandma Laura and Applestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGrandma Laura came to the market to sell some apples. During the day she sold all the apples she had. But grandma is old, so she forgot how many apples she had brought to the market.She precisely remembers she hadnbuyers and each of them bought exactly half of the apples she had at the moment of the purchase and also she gave a half of an apple to some of them as a gift (if the number of apples at the moment of purchase was odd), until she sold all the apples she had.So each buyer took some integral positive number of apples, but maybe he didn't pay for a half of an apple (if the number of apples at the moment of the purchase was odd).For each buyer grandma remembers if she gave a half of an apple as a gift or not. The cost of an apple isp(the numberpis even).Print the total money grandma should have at the end of the day to check if some buyers cheated her.InputThe first line contains two integersnandp(1 ≤n≤ 40, 2 ≤p≤ 1000) — the number of the buyers and the cost of one apple. It is guaranteed that the numberpis even.The nextnlines contains the description of buyers. Each buyer is described with the stringhalfif he simply bought half of the apples and with the stringhalfplusif grandma also gave him a half of an apple as a gift.It is guaranteed that grandma has at least one apple at the start of the day and she has no apples at the end of the day.OutputPrint the only integera— the total money grandma should have at the end of the day.Note that the answer can be too large, so you should use64-bit integer type to store it. InC++you can use thelong longinteger type and inJavayou can uselonginteger type.ExamplesInput2 10halfhalfplusOutput15Input3 10halfplushalfplushalfplusOutput55NoteIn the first sample at the start of the day the grandma had two apples. First she sold one apple and then she sold a half of the second apple and gave a half of the second apple as a present to the second buyer.",
