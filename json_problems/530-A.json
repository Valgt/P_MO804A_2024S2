Quadratic equationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a quadratic equation with integer coefficientsA*X2+B*X+C= 0. It is guaranteed thatA≠ 0and that the equation has at least one real root. Output the roots of the equation.InputThe only line of input contains integersA,BandC(- 1000 ≤A,B,C≤ 1000,A≠ 0), separated by spaces.OutputOutput the roots of the equation in increasing order. If the equation has a single root of multiplicity 2, output it once. The root is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed10- 4.ExamplesInput1 -2 1Output1Input1 0 -1Output-1 1Input2 -3 1Output0.5 1",
