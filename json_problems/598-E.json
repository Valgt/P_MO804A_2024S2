    "statement": "E. Chocolate Bartime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a rectangular chocolate bar consisting ofn×msingle squares. You want to eatexactlyksquares, so you may need to break the chocolate bar.In one move you can break any single rectangular piece of chocolate in two rectangular pieces. You can break only by lines between squares: horizontally or vertically. The cost of breaking is equal to square of the break length.For example, if you have a chocolate bar consisting of2 × 3unit squares then you can break it horizontally and get two1 × 3pieces (the cost of such breaking is32= 9), or you can break it vertically in two ways and get two pieces:2 × 1and2 × 2(the cost of such breaking is22= 4).For several given valuesn,mandkfind the minimum total cost of breaking. You can eat exactlyksquares of chocolate if after all operations of breaking there is a set of rectangular pieces of chocolate with the total size equal toksquares. The remainingn·m-ksquares are not necessarily form a single rectangular piece.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integert(1 ≤t≤ 40910) — the number of valuesn,mandkto process.Each of the nexttlines contains three integersn,mandk(1 ≤n,m≤ 30, 1 ≤k≤min(n·m, 50)) — the dimensions of the chocolate bar and the number of squares you want to eat respectively.OutputFor eachn,mandkprint the minimum total cost needed to break the chocolate bar, in order to make it possible to eat exactlyksquares.ExamplesInput42 2 12 2 32 2 22 2 4Output5540NoteIn the first query of the sample one needs to perform two breaks:to split2 × 2bar into two pieces of2 × 1(cost is22= 4),to split the resulting2 × 1into two1 × 1pieces (cost is12= 1).In the second query of the sample one wants to eat3unit squares. One can use exactly the same strategy as in the first query of the sample.",
