Anton and Polyhedronstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAnton's favourite geometric figures are regular polyhedrons. Note that there are five kinds of regular polyhedrons:Tetrahedron. Tetrahedron has4triangular faces.Cube. Cube has6square faces.Octahedron. Octahedron has8triangular faces.Dodecahedron. Dodecahedron has12pentagonal faces.Icosahedron. Icosahedron has20triangular faces.All five kinds of polyhedrons are shown on the picture below:Anton has a collection ofnpolyhedrons. One day he decided to know, how many faces his polyhedrons have in total. Help Anton and find this number!InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 200 000)— the number of polyhedrons in Anton's collection.Each of the followingnlines of the input contains a stringsi— the name of thei-th polyhedron in Anton's collection. The string can look like this:\"Tetrahedron\" (without quotes), if thei-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a tetrahedron.\"Cube\" (without quotes), if thei-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a cube.\"Octahedron\" (without quotes), if thei-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an octahedron.\"Dodecahedron\" (without quotes), if thei-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a dodecahedron.\"Icosahedron\" (without quotes), if thei-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an icosahedron.OutputOutput one number — the total number of faces in all the polyhedrons in Anton's collection.ExamplesInput4IcosahedronCubeTetrahedronDodecahedronOutput42Input3DodecahedronOctahedronOctahedronOutput28NoteIn the first sample Anton has one icosahedron, one cube, one tetrahedron and one dodecahedron. Icosahedron has20faces, cube has6faces, tetrahedron has4faces and dodecahedron has12faces. In total, they have20 + 6 + 4 + 12 = 42faces.",
