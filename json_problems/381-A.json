The players havencards in a row. Each card contains a number, all numbers on the cards are distinct. The players take turns, Sereja moves first. During his turn a player can take one card: either the leftmost card in a row, or the rightmost one. The game ends when there is no more cards. The player who has the maximum sum of numbers on his cards by the end of the game, wins.Sereja and Dima are being greedy. Each of them chooses the card with the larger number during his move.Inna is a friend of Sereja and Dima. She knows which strategy the guys are using, so she wants to determine the final score, given the initial state of the game. Help her.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 1000)— the number of cards on the table. The second line contains space-separated numbers on the cards from left to right. The numbers on the cards are distinct integers from1to1000.OutputOn a single line, print two integers. The first number is the number of Sereja's points at the end of the game, the second number is the number of Dima's points at the end of the game.ExamplesInput44 1 2 10Output12 5Input71 2 3 4 5 6 7Output16 12NoteIn the first sample Sereja will take cards with numbers10and2, so Sereja's sum is12. Dima will take cards with numbers4and1, so Dima's sum is5.",
