    "statement": "E. Rest In The Shadestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a light source on the plane. This source is so small that it can be represented as point. The light source is moving from point $$$(a, s_y)$$$ to the $$$(b, s_y)$$$ $$$(s_y < 0)$$$ with speed equal to $$$1$$$ unit per second. The trajectory of this light source is a straight segment connecting these two points.There is also a fence on $$$OX$$$ axis represented as $$$n$$$ segments $$$(l_i, r_i)$$$ (so the actual coordinates of endpoints of each segment are $$$(l_i, 0)$$$ and $$$(r_i, 0)$$$). The point $$$(x, y)$$$ isin the shadeif segment connecting $$$(x,y)$$$ and the current position of the light source intersects or touches with any segment of the fence.You are given $$$q$$$ points. For each point calculate total time of this point being in the shade, while the light source is moving from $$$(a, s_y)$$$ to the $$$(b, s_y)$$$.InputFirst line contains three space separated integers $$$s_y$$$, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\le s_y < 0$$$, $$$1 \\\\le a < b \\\\le 10^9$$$) — corresponding coordinates of the light source.Second line contains single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — number of segments in the fence.Next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers per line: $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i < r_i \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$r_{i - 1} < l_i$$$) — segments in the fence in increasing order. Segments don't intersect or touch each other.Next line contains single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — number of points to check.Next $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers per line: $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — points to process.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain one real number — total time of the $$$i$$$-th point being in the shade, while the light source is moving from $$$(a, s_y)$$$ to the $$$(b, s_y)$$$. The answer is considered as correct if its absolute of relative error doesn't exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.ExampleInput-3 1 622 46 753 11 36 16 47 6Output5.0000000000000003.0000000000000000.0000000000000001.5000000000000002.000000000000000NoteThe 1-st point is always in the shade;the 2-nd point is in the shade while light source is moving from $$$(3, -3)$$$ to $$$(6, -3)$$$;the 3-rd point is in the shade while light source is at point $$$(6, -3)$$$.the 4-th point is in the shade while light source is moving from $$$(1, -3)$$$ to $$$(2.5, -3)$$$ and at point $$$(6, -3)$$$;the 5-th point is in the shade while light source is moving from $$$(1, -3)$$$ to $$$(2.5, -3)$$$ and from $$$(5.5, -3)$$$ to $$$(6, -3)$$$;",
