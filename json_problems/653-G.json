    "statement": "G. Move by Primetime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPussycat Sonya has an array consisting ofnpositive integers. There are2npossible subsequences of the array. For each subsequence she counts the minimum number of operations to make all its elements equal. Each operation must be one of two:Choose some element of the subsequence and multiply it by some prime number.Choose some element of the subsequence and divide it by some prime number. The chosen element must be divisible by the chosen prime number.What is the sum of minimum number of operations for all2npossible subsequences? Find and print this sum modulo109+ 7.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 300 000) — the size of the array.The second line containsnintegerst1,t2, ...,tn(1 ≤ti≤ 300 000) — elements of the array.OutputPrint the sum of minimum number of operation for all possible subsequences of the given array modulo109+ 7.ExamplesInput360 60 40Output6Input41 2 3 4Output24NoteIn the first sample, there are8possible subsequences:(60, 60, 40),(60, 60),(60, 40),(60, 40),(60),(60),(40)and()(empty subsequence).For a subsequence(60, 60, 40)we can make all elements equal by two operations — divide40by2to get20, and then multiply20by3to get60. It's impossible to achieve the goal using less operations and thus we add2to the answer.There are two subsequences equal to(60, 40)and for each of them the also need to make at least2operations.In each of other subsequences all numbers are already equal, so we need0operations for each of them. The sum is equal to2 + 2 + 2 = 6.",
