He is being late for an exam.Having rushed to a bus stop that is in point(0, 0), he got on a minibus and they drove along a straight line, parallel to axisOX, in the direction of increasingx.Poor Student knows the following:during one run the minibus makesnstops, thei-th stop is in point(xi, 0)coordinates of all the stops are differentthe minibus drives at a constant speed, equal tovbit can be assumed the passengers get on and off the minibus at a bus stop momentarilyStudent can get off the minibus only at a bus stopStudent will have to get off the minibus at a terminal stop, if he does not get off earlierthe University, where the exam will be held, is in point(xu,yu)Student can run from a bus stop to the University at a constant speedvsas long as neededa distance between two points can be calculated according to the following formula:Student is already on the minibus, so, he cannot get off at the first bus stopPoor Student wants to get to the University as soon as possible. Help him to choose the bus stop, where he should get off. If such bus stops are multiple, choose the bus stop closest to the University.InputThe first line contains three integer numbers:2 ≤n≤ 100,1 ≤vb,vs≤ 1000. The second line containsnnon-negative integers in ascending order: coordinatesxiof the bus stop with indexi. It is guaranteed thatx1equals to zero, andxn≤ 105. The third line contains the coordinates of the University, integersxuandyu, not exceeding105in absolute value.OutputIn the only line output the answer to the problem — index of the optimum bus stop.ExamplesInput4 5 20 2 4 64 1Output3Input2 1 10 100000100000 100000Output2NoteAs you know, students are a special sort of people, and minibuses usually do not hurry. That's why you should not be surprised, if Student's speed is higher than the speed of the minibus.",
