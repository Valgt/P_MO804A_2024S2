Winnertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test64 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe winner of the card game popular in Berland \"Berlogging\" is determined according to the following rules. If at the end of the game there is only one player with the maximum number of points, he is the winner. The situation becomes more difficult if the number of such players is more than one. During each round a player gains or loses a particular number of points. In the course of the game the number of points is registered in the line \"name score\", wherenameis a player's name, andscoreis the number of points gained in this round, which is an integer number. If score is negative, this means that the player has lost in the round. So, if two or more players have the maximum number of points (say, it equals tom) at the end of the game, than wins the oneof themwho scored at leastmpoints first. Initially each player has 0 points. It's guaranteed that at the end of the game at least one player has a positive number of points.InputThe first line contains an integer numbern(1  ≤n≤  1000),nis the number of rounds played.
