What Has Dirichlet Got to Do with That?time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test64 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYou all know the Dirichlet principle, the point of which is that ifnboxes have no less thann+ 1items, that leads to the existence of a box in which there are at least two items.Having heard of that principle, but having not mastered the technique of logical thinking, 8 year olds Stas and Masha invented a game. There areadifferent boxes andbdifferent items, and each turn a player can either add a new box or a new item. The player, after whose turn the number of ways of puttingbitems intoaboxes becomes no less then a certain given numbern, loses. All the boxes and items are considered to be different. Boxes may remain empty.Who loses if both players play optimally and Stas's turn is first?InputThe only input line has three integersa,b,n(1 ≤a≤ 10000,1 ≤b≤ 30,2 ≤n≤ 109) — the initial number of the boxes, the number of the items and the number which constrains the number of ways, respectively. Guaranteed that the initial number of ways is strictly less thann.OutputOutput \"Stas\" if Masha wins. Output \"Masha\" if Stas wins. In case of a draw, output \"Missing\".ExamplesInput2 2 10OutputMashaInput5 5 16808OutputMashaInput3 1 4OutputStasInput1 4 10OutputMissingNoteIn the second example the initial number of ways is equal to3125.If Stas increases the number of boxes, he will lose, as Masha may increase the number of boxes once more during her turn. After that any Stas's move will lead to defeat.But if Stas increases the number of items, then any Masha's move will be losing.",
