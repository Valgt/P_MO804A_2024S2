Free Ice Creamtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAfter their adventure with the magic mirror Kay and Gerda have returned home and sometimes give free ice cream to kids in the summer.At the start of the day they havexice cream packs. Since the ice cream is free, people start standing in the queue before Kay and Gerda's house even in the night. Each person in the queue wants either to take several ice cream packs for himself and his friends or to give several ice cream packs to Kay and Gerda (carriers that bring ice cream have to stand in the same queue).If a carrier withdice cream packs comes to the house, then Kay and Gerda take all his packs. If a child who wants to takedice cream packs comes to the house, then Kay and Gerda will give himdpacks if they have enough ice cream, otherwise the child will get no ice cream at all and will leave in distress.Kay wants to find the amount of ice cream they will have after all people will leave from the queue, and Gerda wants to find the number of distressed kids.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandx(1 ≤n≤ 1000,0 ≤x≤ 109).Each of the nextnlines contains a character '+' or '-', and an integerdi, separated by a space (1 ≤di≤ 109). Record \"+di\" ini-th line means that a carrier withdiice cream packs occupiesi-th place from the start of the queue, and record \"-di\" means that a child who wants to takedipacks stands ini-th place.OutputPrint two space-separated integers — number of ice cream packs left after all operations, and number of kids that left the house in distress.ExamplesInput5 7+ 5- 10- 20+ 40- 20Output22 1Input5 17- 16- 2- 98+ 100- 98Output3 2NoteConsider the first sample.Initially Kay and Gerda have7packs of ice cream.Carrier brings5more, so now they have12packs.A kid asks for10packs and receives them. There are only2packs remaining.Another kid asks for20packs. Kay and Gerda do not have them, so the kid goes away distressed.Carrier bring40packs, now Kay and Gerda have42packs.Kid asks for20packs and receives them. There are22packs remaining.",
