Encrypting Messagestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe Smart Beaver from ABBYY invented a new message encryption method and now wants to check its performance. Checking it manually is long and tiresome, so he decided to ask the ABBYY Cup contestants for help.A message is a sequence ofnintegersa1,a2, ...,an. Encryption uses a key which is a sequence ofmintegersb1,b2, ...,bm(m≤n). All numbers from the message and from the key belong to the interval from0toc- 1, inclusive, and all the calculations are performed moduloc.Encryption is performed inn-m+ 1steps. On the first step we add to each numbera1,a2, ...,ama corresponding numberb1,b2, ...,bm. On the second step we add to each numbera2,a3, ...,am+ 1(changed on the previous step) a corresponding numberb1,b2, ...,bm. And so on: on step numberiwe add to each numberai,ai+ 1, ...,ai+m- 1a corresponding numberb1,b2, ...,bm. The result of the encryption is the sequencea1,a2, ...,anaftern-m+ 1steps.Help the Beaver to write a program that will encrypt messages in the described manner.InputThe first input line contains three integersn,mandc, separated by single spaces.The second input line containsnintegersai(0 ≤ai<c), separated by single spaces — the original message.The third input line containsmintegersbi(0 ≤bi<c), separated by single spaces — the encryption key.The input limitations for getting 30 points are:1 ≤m≤n≤ 1031 ≤c≤ 103The input limitations for getting 100 points are:1 ≤m≤n≤ 1051 ≤c≤ 103OutputPrintnspace-separated integers — the result of encrypting the original message.ExamplesInput4 3 21 1 1 11 1 1Output0 1 1 0Input3 1 51 2 34Output0 1 2NoteIn the first sample the encryption is performed in two steps: after the first stepa= (0, 0, 0, 1)(remember that the calculations are performed modulo 2), after the second stepa= (0, 1, 1, 0), and that is the answer.",
