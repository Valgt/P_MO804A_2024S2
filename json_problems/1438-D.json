Powerful Kseniatime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKsenia has an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$.In one operation she can do the following:choose three distinct indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$, and thenchange all of $$$a_i, a_j, a_k$$$ to $$$a_i \\\\oplus a_j \\\\oplus a_k$$$ simultaneously, where $$$\\\\oplus$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operation.She wants to make all $$$a_i$$$ equalin at most $$$n$$$ operations, or to determine that it is impossible to do so. She wouldn't ask for your help, but please, help her!InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers, $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — elements of $$$a$$$.OutputPrintYESorNOin the first line depending on whether it is possible to make all elements equal in at most $$$n$$$ operations.If it is possible, print an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq m \\\\leq n$$$), which denotes the number of operations you do.In each of the next $$$m$$$ lines, print three distinct integers $$$i, j, k$$$, representing one operation.If there are many such operation sequences possible, print any. Note that you donothave to minimize the number of operations.ExamplesInput5 4 2 1 7 2OutputYES 1 1 3 4Input4 10 4 49 22OutputNONoteIn the first example, the array becomes $$$[4 \\\\oplus 1 \\\\oplus 7, 2, 4 \\\\oplus 1 \\\\oplus 7, 4 \\\\oplus 1 \\\\oplus 7, 2] = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]$$$.",
