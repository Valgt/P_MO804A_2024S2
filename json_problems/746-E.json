Numbers Exchangetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEugeny hasncards, each of them has exactly one integer written on it. Eugeny wants to exchange some cards with Nikolay so that the number of even integers on his cards would equal the number of odd integers, and that all these numbers would bedistinct.Nikolay hasmcards, distinct numbers from1tomare written on them, one per card. It means that Nikolay has exactly one card with number1, exactly one card with number2and so on.A single exchange is a process in which Eugeny gives one card to Nikolay and takes another one from those Nikolay has. Your task is to find the minimum number of card exchanges and determine which cards Eugeny should exchange.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(2 ≤n≤ 2·105,1 ≤m≤ 109) — the number of cards Eugeny has and the number of cards Nikolay has. It is guaranteed thatnis even.The second line contains a sequence ofnpositive integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — the numbers on Eugeny's cards.OutputIf there is no answer, print-1.Otherwise, in the first line print the minimum number of exchanges. In the second line printnintegers — Eugeny's cards after all the exchanges with Nikolay. The order of cards should coincide with the card's order in the input data. If thei-th card wasn't exchanged then thei-th number should coincide with the number from the input data. Otherwise, it is considered that this card was exchanged, and thei-th number should be equal to the number on the card it was exchanged to.If there are multiple answers, it is allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput6 25 6 7 9 4 5Output15 6 7 9 4 2Input8 67 7 7 7 8 8 8 8Output67 2 4 6 8 1 3 5Input4 14 2 1 10Output-1",
