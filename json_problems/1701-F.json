Pointstime limit per test6.5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA triple of points $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ and $$$k$$$ on a coordinate line is calledbeautifulif $$$i < j < k$$$ and $$$k - i \\\\le d$$$.You are given a set of points on a coordinate line, initially empty. You have to process queries of three types:add a point;remove a point;calculate the number of beautiful triples consisting of points belonging to the set.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$q$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q, d \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries and the parameter for defining if a triple is beautiful, respectively.The second line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) denoting the queries. The integer $$$a_i$$$ denotes the $$$i$$$-th query in the following way:if the point $$$a_i$$$ belongs to the set, remove it; otherwise, add it;after adding or removing the point, print the number of beautiful triples.OutputFor each query, print one integer — the number of beautiful triples after processing the respective query.ExampleInput7 5 8 5 3 2 1 5 6Output0 0 1 2 5 1 5",
