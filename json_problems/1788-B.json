Sum of Two Numberstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe sum of digits of a non-negative integer $$$a$$$ is the result of summing up its digits together when written in the decimal system. For example, the sum of digits of $$$123$$$ is $$$6$$$ and the sum of digits of $$$10$$$ is $$$1$$$. In a formal way, the sum of digits of $$$\\\\displaystyle a=\\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\infty} a_i \\\\cdot 10^i$$$, where $$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 9$$$, is defined as $$$\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\infty}{a_i}$$$.Given an integer $$$n$$$, find two non-negative integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ which satisfy the following conditions.$$$x+y=n$$$, andthe sum of digits of $$$x$$$ and the sum of digits of $$$y$$$ differ by at most $$$1$$$.It can be shown that such $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ always exist.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10\\\\,000$$$).Each test case consists of a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^9$$$)OutputFor each test case, print two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.If there are multiple answers, print any.ExampleInput5 1 161 67 1206 19Output1 0 67 94 60 7 1138 68 14 5NoteIn the second test case, the sum of digits of $$$67$$$ and the sum of digits of $$$94$$$ are both $$$13$$$.In the third test case, the sum of digits of $$$60$$$ is $$$6$$$, and the sum of digits of $$$7$$$ is $$$7$$$.",
