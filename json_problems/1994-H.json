Fortnitetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problem!Timofey is writing a competition called Capture the Flag (or CTF for short). He has one task left, which involves hacking a security system. The entire system is based on polynomial hashes$$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$$.Timofey can input a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters into the system, and the system will return its polynomial hash. To hack the system, Timofey needs to find the polynomial hash parameters ($$$p$$$ and $$$m$$$) that the system uses.Timofey doesn't have much time left, so he will only be able to make $$$3$$$ queries. Help him solve the task.$$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$$ The polynomial hash of a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters of length $$$n$$$, based on $$$p$$$ and modulo $$$m$$$ is $$$(\\\\mathrm{ord}(s_1) \\\\cdot p ^ 0 + \\\\mathrm{ord}(s_2) \\\\cdot p ^ 1 + \\\\mathrm{ord}(s_3) \\\\cdot p ^ 2 + \\\\ldots + \\\\mathrm{ord}(s_n) \\\\cdot p ^ {n - 1}) \\\\bmod m$$$. Where $$$s_i$$$ denotes the $$$i$$$-th character of the string $$$s$$$, $$$\\\\mathrm{ord}(\\\\mathrm{chr})$$$ denotes the ordinal number of the character $$$\\\\mathrm{chr}$$$ in the English alphabet, and $$$x \\\\bmod m$$$ is the remainder of $$$x$$$ when divided by $$$m$$$.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.It is guaranteed that the $$$p$$$ and $$$m$$$ used by the system satisfy the conditions: $$$26 < p \\\\leq 50$$$ and $$$p + 1 < m \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^9$$$.InteractionTo make a query to the system, output?$$$s$$$, where $$$s$$$ is a string ofno more than$$$50$$$ characters in length, the hash of which you want to know. In response to this query, you will receive the polynomial hash of the string $$$s$$$.To output the answer, output!$$$p$$$ $$$m$$$, where $$$p$$$ is the base of the hash, and $$$m$$$ is the modulus. After that, immediately proceed to the next test case.You have to make not more than $$$3$$$ queries?, otherwise you will get verdictWrong Answer.After outputting a query, do not forget to output a newline and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdictIdleness limit exceeded. To flush the buffer, use:fflush(stdout)orcout.flush()in C++;System.out.flush()in Java;flush(output)in Pascal;stdout.flush()in Python;see the documentation for other languages.ExampleInput1  32  28Output? aa  ? yb  ! 31 59NoteAnswer for the first query is $$$(ord(a) \\\\cdot 31^0 + ord(a) \\\\cdot 31^1) \\\\mod 59 = (1 + 1 \\\\cdot 31) \\\\mod 59 = 32$$$.Answer for the second query is $$$(ord(y) \\\\cdot 31^0 + ord(b) \\\\cdot 31^1) \\\\mod 59 = (25 + 2 \\\\cdot 31) \\\\mod 59 = 28$$$.",
