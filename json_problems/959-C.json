Mahmoud and Ehab and the wrong algorithmtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMahmoud was trying to solve the vertex cover problem on trees. The problem statement is:Given an undirected tree consisting ofnnodes, find the minimum number of vertices that cover all the edges. Formally, we need to find a set of vertices such that for each edge(u,v)that belongs to the tree, eitheruis in the set, orvis in the set,or both are in the set. Mahmoud has found the following algorithm:Root the tree at node1.Count the number of nodes at an even depth. Let it beevenCnt.Count the number of nodes at an odd depth. Let it beoddCnt.The answer is the minimum betweenevenCntandoddCnt.The depth of a node in a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between this node and the root. The depth of the root is 0.Ehab told Mahmoud that this algorithm is wrong, but he didn't believe because he had tested his algorithm against many trees and it worked, so Ehab asked you to find 2 trees consisting ofnnodes. The algorithm should find an incorrect answer for the first tree and a correct answer for the second one.InputThe only line contains an integern(2 ≤n≤ 105), the number of nodes in the desired trees.OutputThe output should consist of 2independentsections, each containing a tree. The algorithm should find an incorrect answer for the tree in the first section and a correct answer for the tree in the second. If a tree doesn't exist for some section, output \"-1\" (without quotes)for that section only.If the answer for a section exists, it should containn- 1lines, each containing 2 space-separated integersuandv(1 ≤u,v≤n), which means that there's an undirected edge between nodeuand nodev. If the given graph isn't a tree or it doesn't follow the format, you'll receive wrong answer verdict.If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.ExamplesInput2Output-11 2Input8Output1 21 32 42 53 64 74 81 21 32 42 52 63 76 8NoteIn the first sample, there is only 1 tree with 2 nodes (node1connected to node2). The algorithm will produce a correct answer in it so we printed- 1in the first section, but notice that we printed this tree in the second section.In the second sample:In the first tree, the algorithm will find an answer with 4 nodes, while there exists an answer with 3 nodes like this:In the second tree, the algorithm will find an answer with 3 nodes which is correct:",
