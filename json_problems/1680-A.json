Minimums and Maximumstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAn array isbeautifulif both of the following two conditions meet:there areat least$$$l_1$$$ andat most$$$r_1$$$ elements in the array equal to its minimum;there areat least$$$l_2$$$ andat most$$$r_2$$$ elements in the array equal to its maximum.For example, the array $$$[2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 3, 2]$$$ has $$$3$$$ elements equal to its minimum ($$$1$$$-st, $$$3$$$-rd and $$$7$$$-th) and $$$2$$$ elements equal to its maximum ($$$4$$$-th and $$$5$$$-th).Another example: the array $$$[42, 42, 42]$$$ has $$$3$$$ elements equal to its minimum and $$$3$$$ elements equal to its maximum.Your task is to calculate theminimumpossible number of elements in abeautifularray.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing four integers $$$l_1$$$, $$$r_1$$$, $$$l_2$$$ and $$$r_2$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_1 \\\\le r_1 \\\\le 50$$$; $$$1 \\\\le l_2 \\\\le r_2 \\\\le 50$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum possible number of elements in a beautiful array.ExampleInput73 5 4 65 8 5 53 3 10 121 5 3 31 1 2 22 2 1 16 6 6 6Output4 5 13 3 3 3 6NoteOptimal arrays in the test cases of the example:$$$[1, 1, 1, 1]$$$, it has $$$4$$$ minimums and $$$4$$$ maximums;$$$[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]$$$, it has $$$5$$$ minimums and $$$5$$$ maximums;$$$[1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]$$$, it has $$$3$$$ minimums and $$$10$$$ maximums;$$$[8, 8, 8]$$$, it has $$$3$$$ minimums and $$$3$$$ maximums;$$$[4, 6, 6]$$$, it has $$$1$$$ minimum and $$$2$$$ maximums;$$$[3, 4, 3]$$$, it has $$$2$$$ minimums and $$$1$$$ maximum;$$$[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]$$$, it has $$$6$$$ minimums and $$$6$$$ maximums.",
