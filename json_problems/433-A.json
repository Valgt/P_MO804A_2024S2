Now he wants to divide all the apples between the friends.Each apple weights 100 grams or 200 grams. Of course Kitahara Haruki doesn't want to offend any of his friend. Therefore the total weight of the apples given to Touma Kazusa must be equal to the total weight of the apples given to Ogiso Setsuna.But unfortunately Kitahara Haruki doesn't have a knife right now, so he cannot split any apple into some parts. Please, tell him: is it possible to divide all the apples in a fair way between his friends?InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 100)— the number of apples. The second line containsnintegersw1,w2, ...,wn(wi= 100orwi= 200), wherewiis the weight of thei-th apple.OutputIn a single line print \"YES\" (without the quotes) if it is possible to divide all the apples between his friends.
