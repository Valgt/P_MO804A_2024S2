Third Month Insanitytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe annual college sports-ball tournament is approaching, which for trademark reasons we'll refer to as Third Month Insanity. There are a total of2Nteams participating in the tournament, numbered from1to2N. The tournament lastsNrounds, with each round eliminating half the teams. The first round consists of2N- 1games, numbered starting from1. In gamei, team2·i- 1will play against team2·i. The loser is eliminated and the winner advances to the next round (there are no ties). Each subsequent round has half as many games as the previous round, and in gameithe winner of the previous round's game2·i- 1will play against the winner of the previous round's game2·i.Every year the office has a pool to see who can create the best bracket. A bracket is a set of winner predictions for every game. For games in the first round you may predict either team to win, but for games in later rounds the winner you predict must also be predicted as a winner in the previous round. Note that the bracket is fully constructed before any games are actually played. Correct predictions in the first round are worth1point, and correct predictions in each subsequent round are worth twice as many points as the previous, so correct predictions in the final game are worth2N- 1points.For every pair of teams in the league, you have estimated the probability of each team winning if they play against each other. Now you want to construct a bracket with the maximum possible expected score.InputInput will begin with a line containingN(2 ≤N≤ 6).2Nlines follow, each with2Nintegers. Thej-th column of thei-th row indicates the percentage chance that teamiwill defeat teamj, unlessi=j, in which case the value will be0. It is guaranteed that thei-th column of thej-th row plus thej-th column of thei-th row will add to exactly100.OutputPrint the maximum possible expected score over all possible brackets. Your answer must be correct to within an absolute or relative error of10- 9.Formally, let your answer bea, and the jury's answer beb. Your answer will be considered correct, if.ExamplesInput20 40 100 10060 0 40 400 60 0 450 60 55 0Output1.75Input30 0 100 0 100 0 0 0100 0 100 0 0 0 100 1000 0 0 100 100 0 0 0100 100 0 0 0 0 100 1000 100 0 100 0 0 100 0100 100 100 100 100 0 0 0100 0 100 0 0 100 0 0100 0 100 0 100 100 100 0Output12Input20 21 41 2679 0 97 3359 3 0 9174 67 9 0Output3.141592NoteIn the first example, you should predict teams1and4to win in round1, and team1to win in round2. Recall that the winner you predict in round2must also be predicted as a winner in round1.",
