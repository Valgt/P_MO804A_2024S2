At first, the first two players in the line play a game. Then the loser goes to the end of the line, and the winner plays with the next person from the line, and so on. They play until someone winskgames in a row. This player becomes the winner.For each of the participants, you know the power to play table tennis, and for all players these values are different. In a game the player with greater power always wins. Determine who will be the winner.InputThe first line contains two integers:nandk(2 ≤n≤ 500,2 ≤k≤ 1012) — the number of people and the number of wins.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤n) — powers of the player.
