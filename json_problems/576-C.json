The distance between the two points with numbersaandbis said to be the following value:(the distance calculated by such formula is calledManhattan distance).We call a hamiltonian path to be some permutationpiof numbers from1ton. We say that the length of this path is value.Find some hamiltonian path with a length of no more than25 × 108. Note that you do not have to minimize the path length.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 106).Thei+ 1-th line contains the coordinates of thei-th point:xiandyi(0 ≤xi,yi≤ 106).It is guaranteed that no two points coincide.OutputPrint the permutation of numberspifrom1ton— the sought Hamiltonian path.
