Balls are numbered1throughn, from left to right. There arenpossible colors, also numbered1throughn. Thei-th ball has colorti.For a fixed interval (set of consecutive elements) of balls we can define adominantcolor. It's a color occurring the biggest number of times in the interval. In case of a tie between some colors, the one with the smallest number (index) is chosen as dominant.There arenon-empty intervals in total. For each color, your task is to count the number of intervals in which this color is dominant.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 5000) — the number of balls.The second line containsnintegerst1,t2, ...,tn(1 ≤ti≤n) wheretiis the color of thei-th ball.OutputPrintnintegers. Thei-th of them should be equal to the number of intervals whereiis a dominant color.ExamplesInput41 2 1 2Output7 3 0 0Input31 1 1Output6 0 0NoteIn the first sample, color2is dominant in three intervals:An interval[2, 2]contains one ball. This ball's color is2so it's clearly a dominant color.An interval[4, 4]contains one ball, with color2again.An interval[2, 4]contains two balls of color2and one ball of color1.There are7more intervals and color1is dominant in all of them.",
