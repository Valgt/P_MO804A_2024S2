Letters Removingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPetya has a string of lengthnconsisting of small and large English letters and digits.He performsmoperations. Each operation is described with two integerslandrand a characterc: Petya removes from the string all characterscon positions betweenlandr, inclusive. It's obvious that the length of the string remains the same or decreases after each operation.Find how the string will look like after Petya performs allmoperations.InputThe first string contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 2·105) — the length of the string and the number of operations.The second line contains the string of lengthn, consisting of small and large English letters and digits. Positions in the string are enumerated from1.Each of the nextmlines contains two integerslandr(1 ≤l≤r), followed by a characterc, which is a small or large English letter or a digit. This line describes one operation. It is guaranteed thatrdoesn't exceed the length of the stringsbefore current operation.OutputPrint the string Petya will obtain after performing allmoperations. If the strings becomes empty after all operations, print an empty line.ExamplesInput4 2abac1 3 a2 2 cOutputbInput3 2A0z1 3 01 1 zOutputAzInput10 4agtFrgF4aF2 5 g4 9 F1 5 41 7 aOutputtFrg4Input9 5aAAaBBccD1 4 a5 6 c2 3 B4 4 D2 3 AOutputABNoteIn the first example during the first operation both letters 'a' are removed, so the string becomes \"bc\". During the second operation the letter 'c' (on the second position) is removed, and the string becomes \"b\".In the second example during the first operation Petya removes '0' from the second position. After that the string becomes \"Az\". During the second operations the string doesn't change.",
