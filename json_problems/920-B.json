Tea Queuetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecentlynstudents from city S moved to city P to attend a programming camp.They moved there by train. In the evening, all students in the train decided that they want to drink some tea. Of course, no two people can use the same teapot simultaneously, so the students had to form a queue to get their tea.i-th student comes to the end of the queue at the beginning ofli-th second. If there are multiple students coming to the queue in the same moment, then the student with greater index comes after the student with lesser index. Students in the queue behave as follows: if there is nobody in the queue before the student, then he uses the teapot for exactly one second and leaves the queue with his tea; otherwise the student waits for the people before him to get their tea. If at the beginning ofri-th second studentistill cannot get his tea (there is someone before him in the queue), then he leaves the queue without getting any tea.For each student determine the second he will use the teapot and get his tea (if he actually gets it).InputThe first line contains one integert— the number of test cases to solve (1 ≤t≤ 1000).Thenttest cases follow. The first line of each test case contains one integern(1 ≤n≤ 1000) — the number of students.Thennlines follow. Each line contains two integerli,ri(1 ≤li≤ri≤ 5000) — the secondi-th student comes to the end of the queue, and the second he leaves the queue if he still cannot get his tea.It is guaranteed that for everyconditionli- 1≤liholds.The sum ofnover all test cases doesn't exceed1000.Note that in hacks you have to sett= 1.OutputFor each test case printnintegers.i-th of them must be equal to the second wheni-th student gets his tea, or0if he leaves without tea.ExampleInput221 31 431 51 12 3Output1 21 0 2NoteThe example contains2tests:During1-st second, students1and2come to the queue, and student1gets his tea.
