Comparing Two Long Integerstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two very long integersa,b(leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what numberaorbis greater or determine that they are equal.The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to usescanf/printfinstead ofcin/coutin C++, prefer to useBufferedReader/PrintWriterinstead ofScanner/System.outinJava. Don't use the functioninput()inPython2instead of it use the functionraw_input().InputThe first line contains a non-negative integera.The second line contains a non-negative integerb.The numbersa,bmay contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than106digits.OutputPrint the symbol \"<\" ifa<band the symbol \">\" ifa>b.
