Power Productstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$, and an integer $$$k \\\\geq 2$$$. Count the number of pairs $$$i, j$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\leq i < j \\\\leq n$$$, and there exists an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$a_i \\\\cdot a_j = x^k$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 100$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^5$$$).OutputPrint a single integer — the number of suitable pairs.ExampleInput6 3 1 3 9 8 24 1Output5NoteIn the sample case, the suitable pairs are:$$$a_1 \\\\cdot a_4 = 8 = 2^3$$$;$$$a_1 \\\\cdot a_6 = 1 = 1^3$$$;$$$a_2 \\\\cdot a_3 = 27 = 3^3$$$;$$$a_3 \\\\cdot a_5 = 216 = 6^3$$$;$$$a_4 \\\\cdot a_6 = 8 = 2^3$$$.",
