Today Simon asked you to find a pair of integersl,r(1 ≤l≤r≤n), such that the following conditions hold:there is integerj(l≤j≤r), such that all integersal,al+ 1, ...,arare divisible byaj;valuer-ltakes the maximum value among all pairs for which condition1is true;Help Simon, find the required pair of numbers(l,r). If there are multiple required pairs find all of them.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 3·105).The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 106).OutputPrint two integers in the first line — the number of required pairs and the maximum value ofr-l. On the following line print alllvalues from optimal pairs in increasing order.ExamplesInput54 6 9 3 6Output1 32Input51 3 5 7 9Output1 41Input52 3 5 7 11Output5 01 2 3 4 5NoteIn the first sample the pair of numbers is right, as numbers6, 9, 3are divisible by3.In the second sample all numbers are divisible by number1.In the third sample all numbers are prime, so conditions1and2are true only for pairs of numbers(1, 1),(2, 2),(3, 3),(4, 4),(5, 5).",
