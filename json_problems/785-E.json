Anton and Permutationtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAnton likes permutations, especially he likes to permute their elements. Note that a permutation ofnelements is a sequence of numbers{a1,a2, ...,an}, in which every number from1tonappears exactly once.One day Anton got a new permutation and started to play with it. He does the following operationqtimes: he takes two elements of the permutation and swaps these elements. After each operation he asks his friend Vanya, how many inversions there are in the new permutation. The number of inversions in a permutation is the number of distinct pairs(i,j)such that1 ≤i<j≤nandai>aj.Vanya is tired of answering Anton's silly questions. So he asked you to write a program that would answer these questions instead of him.Initially Anton's permutation was{1, 2, ...,n}, that isai=ifor allisuch that1 ≤i≤n.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandq(1 ≤n≤ 200 000, 1 ≤q≤ 50 000)— the length of the permutation and the number of operations that Anton does.Each of the followingqlines of the input contains two integersliandri(1 ≤li,ri≤n)— the indices of elements that Anton swaps during thei-th operation. Note that indices of elements that Anton swaps during thei-th operation can coincide. Elements in the permutation are numbered starting with one.OutputOutputqlines. Thei-th line of the output is the number of inversions in the Anton's permutation after thei-th operation.ExamplesInput5 44 52 42 52 2Output1433Input2 12 1Output1Input6 71 43 52 33 33 62 15 1Output567710118NoteConsider the first sample.After the first Anton's operation the permutation will be{1, 2, 3, 5, 4}. There is only one inversion in it:(4, 5).After the second Anton's operation the permutation will be{1, 5, 3, 2, 4}. There are four inversions:(2, 3),(2, 4),(2, 5)and(3, 4).After the third Anton's operation the permutation will be{1, 4, 3, 2, 5}. There are three inversions:(2, 3),(2, 4)and(3, 4).After the fourth Anton's operation the permutation doesn't change, so there are still three inversions.",
