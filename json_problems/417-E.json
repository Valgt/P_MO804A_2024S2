Square Tabletime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutWhile resting on the ship after the \"Russian Code Cup\" a boy named Misha invented an interesting game. He promised to give his quadrocopter to whoever will be the first one to make a rectangular table of sizen×m, consisting of positive integers such that the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column was also a square.Since checking the correctness of the table manually is difficult, Misha asks you to make each number in the table to not exceed108.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 100)  — the size of the table.OutputPrint the table that meets the condition:nlines containingmintegers, separated by spaces. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print anyone. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one correct answer.ExamplesInput1 1Output1Input1 2Output3 4",
