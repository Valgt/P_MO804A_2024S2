Dr. Evil Underscorestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputToday, as a friendship gift, Bakry gave Badawy $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ and challenged him to choose an integer $$$X$$$ such that the value $$$\\\\underset{1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n}{\\\\max} (a_i \\\\oplus X)$$$ is minimum possible, where $$$\\\\oplus$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operation.As always, Badawy is too lazy, so you decided to help him and find the minimum possible value of $$$\\\\underset{1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n}{\\\\max} (a_i \\\\oplus X)$$$.InputThe first line contains integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2^{30}-1$$$).OutputPrint one integer â€” the minimum possible value of $$$\\\\underset{1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n}{\\\\max} (a_i \\\\oplus X)$$$.ExamplesInput3 1 2 3Output2Input2 1 5Output4NoteIn the first sample, we can choose $$$X = 3$$$.In the second sample, we can choose $$$X = 5$$$.",
