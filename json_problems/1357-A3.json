Distinguish H from Xtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an operation that implements a single-qubit unitary transformation: either the H gate or the X gate. The operation will have Adjoint and Controlled variants defined.Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which unitary it was and to return 0 if it was the H gate or 1 if it was the X gate.You are allowed to apply the given operation and its adjoint/controlled variantsat most twice.You have to implement an operation which takes a single-qubit operation as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;operation Solve (unitary : (Qubit => Unit is Adj+Ctl)) : Int {// your code here}}",
