Primary Tasktime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDmitry wrote down $$$t$$$ integers on the board, and that is good. He is sure that he lost animportantinteger $$$n$$$ among them, and that is bad.The integer $$$n$$$ had the form $$$\\\\text{10^x}$$$ ($$$x \\\\ge 2$$$), where the symbol '$$$\\\\text{^}$$$' denotes exponentiation.. Something went wrong, and Dmitry missed the symbol '$$$\\\\text{^}$$$' when writing theimportantinteger. For example, instead of the integer $$$10^5$$$, he would have written $$$105$$$, and instead of $$$10^{19}$$$, he would have written $$$1019$$$.Dmitry wants to understand which of the integers on the board could have been theimportantinteger and which could not.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of integers on the board.The next $$$t$$$ lines each contain an integer $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a \\\\le 10000$$$) — the next integer from the board.OutputFor each integer on the board, output \"YES\" if it could have been theimportantinteger and \"NO\" otherwise.You may output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be accepted as a positive answer.ExampleInput71001010101105203310191002OutputNO YES NO YES NO YES NO",
