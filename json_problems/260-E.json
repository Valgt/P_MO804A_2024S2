Flatland hasncities, each of them is a point on the plane.Flatland is ruled by king Circle IV. Circle IV has 9 sons. He wants to give each of his sons part of Flatland to rule. For that, he wants to draw fourdistinctstraight lines, such that two of them are parallel to theOxaxis, and two others are parallel to theOyaxis. At that, no straight line can go through any city. Thus, Flatland will be divided into 9 parts, and each son will be given exactly one of these parts. Circle IV thought a little, evaluated his sons' obedience and decided that thei-th son should get the part of Flatland that has exactlyaicities.Help Circle find such four straight lines that if we divide Flatland into 9 parts by these lines, the resulting parts can be given to the sons so that son numberigot the part of Flatland which containsaicities.InputThe first line contains integern(9 ≤n≤ 105)— the number of cities in Flatland. Nextnlines each contain two space-separated integers:xi,yi( - 109≤xi,yi≤ 109)— the coordinates of thei-th city. No two cities are located at the same point. The last line contains nine space-separated integers:.OutputIf there is no solution, print a single integer -1.Otherwise, print in the first line two distinct real space-separated numbers:x1,x2— the abscissas of the straight lines that are parallel to theOyaxis. And in the second line print two distinct real space-separated numbers:y1,y2— the ordinates of the straight lines, parallel to theOx. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.When the answer is being checked, a city is considered to lie on a straight line, if the distance between the city and the line doesn't exceed10- 6. Two straight lines are considered the same if the distance between them doesn't exceed10- 6.ExamplesInput91 11 21 32 12 22 33 13 23 31 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1Output1.5000000000 2.50000000001.5000000000 2.5000000000Input154 4-1 -31 53 -4-4 4-1 13 -3-4 -5-3 33 24 1-4 2-2 -5-3 4-1 42 1 2 1 2 1 3 2 1Output-3.5000000000 2.00000000003.5000000000 -1.0000000000Input10-2 106 0-16 -6-4 13-4 -2-17 -109 1518 16-5 210 -52 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1Output-1NoteThe solution for the first sample test is shown below:The solution for the second sample test is shown below:There is no solution for the third sample test.",
