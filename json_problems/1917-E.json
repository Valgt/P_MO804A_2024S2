    "statement": "E. Construct Matrixtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given aneveninteger $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$. Your task is to construct a matrix of size $$$n \\\\times n$$$ consisting of numbers $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ in such a way that the following conditions are true, or report that it is impossible:the sum of all the numbers in the matrix is exactly $$$k$$$;the bitwise $$$\\\\texttt{XOR}$$$ of all the numbers in the row $$$i$$$ is the same for each $$$i$$$;the bitwise $$$\\\\texttt{XOR}$$$ of all the numbers in the column $$$j$$$ is the same for each $$$j$$$.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 130$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.Each test case is described by a single line, which contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1000$$$, $$$n$$$ is even, $$$0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n^2$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$\\\\texttt{Yes}$$$ if it's possible to construct a matrix that satisfies all of the problem's conditions, and $$$\\\\texttt{No}$$$ otherwise.If it is possible to construct a matrix, the $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines should contain $$$n$$$ integers representing the elements in the $$$i$$$-th row of the matrix.ExampleInput5 4 0 6 6 6 5 4 2 6 36OutputYes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Yes 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 No No Yes 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1NoteIn the first example, all conditions are satisfied:the sum of all the numbers in the matrix is exactly $$$0$$$;the bitwise $$$\\\\texttt{XOR}$$$ of all the numbers in the row $$$i$$$ is $$$0$$$ for each $$$i$$$;the bitwise $$$\\\\texttt{XOR}$$$ of all the numbers in the column $$$j$$$ is $$$0$$$ for each $$$j$$$.In the third example, it can be shown that it's impossible to find a matrix satisfying all the problem's conditions.",
