Your task is to count all right triangles with two sides parallel to the square sides, whose vertices are in the centers of'*'-cells. A right triangle is a triangle in which one angle is a right angle (that is, a 90 degree angle).InputThe first line contains two positive integer numbersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 1000).
