The fruits are a sequence of apples and oranges, which is represented by a binary string $$$s_1s_2\\\\ldots s_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. $$$1$$$ represents an apple and $$$0$$$ represents an orange.Since wabbit is allergic to eating oranges, Zookeeper would like to find the longestcontiguoussequence of apples. Let $$$f(l,r)$$$ be the longestcontiguoussequence of apples in the substring $$$s_{l}s_{l+1}\\\\ldots s_{r}$$$.Help Zookeeper find $$$\\\\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\\\sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r)$$$, or the sum of $$$f$$$ across all substrings.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 5 \\\\cdot 10^5)$$$.The next line contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ $$$(s_i \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\})$$$OutputPrint a single integer: $$$\\\\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\\\sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r)$$$.ExamplesInput4 0110Output12Input7 1101001Output30Input12 011100011100Output156NoteIn the first test, there are ten substrings. The list of them (we let $$$[l,r]$$$ be the substring $$$s_l s_{l+1} \\\\ldots s_r$$$):$$$[1,1]$$$: 0$$$[1,2]$$$: 01$$$[1,3]$$$: 011$$$[1,4]$$$: 0110$$$[2,2]$$$: 1$$$[2,3]$$$: 11$$$[2,4]$$$: 110$$$[3,3]$$$: 1$$$[3,4]$$$: 10$$$[4,4]$$$: 0The lengths of the longest contiguous sequence of ones in each of these ten substrings are $$$0,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,0$$$ respectively. Hence, the answer is $$$0+1+2+2+1+2+2+1+1+0 = 12$$$.",
