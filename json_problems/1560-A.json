Dislike of Threestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp doesn't like integers that are divisible by $$$3$$$ or end with the digit $$$3$$$ in their decimal representation. Integers that meet both conditions are disliked by Polycarp, too.Polycarp starts to write out the positive (greater than $$$0$$$) integers which he likes: $$$1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, \\\\dots$$$. Output the $$$k$$$-th element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from $$$1$$$).InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 1000$$$).OutputFor each test case, output in a separate line one integer $$$x$$$ — the $$$k$$$-th element of the sequence that was written out by Polycarp.ExampleInput10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1000Output1 2 4 5 7 8 10 11 14 1666",
