Dynamic Shortest Pathtime limit per test10 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a weighted directed graph, consisting ofnvertices andmedges. You should answerqqueries of two types:1 v— find the length of shortest path from vertex1to vertexv.2 cl1l2...lc— add1to weights of edges with indicesl1,l2, ...,lc.InputThe first line of input data contains integersn,m,q(1 ≤n,m≤ 105,1 ≤q≤ 2000) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the number of requests correspondingly.Nextmlines of input data contain the descriptions of edges:i-th of them contains description of edge with indexi— three integersai,bi,ci(1 ≤ai,bi≤n,0 ≤ci≤ 109) — the beginning and the end of edge, and its initial weight correspondingly.Nextqlines of input data contain the description of edges in the format described above (1 ≤v≤n,1 ≤lj≤m). It's guaranteed that inside single query allljare distinct. Also, it's guaranteed that a total number of edges in all requests of the second type does not exceed106.OutputFor each query of first type print the length of the shortest path from1tovin a separate line. Print-1, if such path does not exists.ExamplesInput3 2 91 2 02 3 02 1 21 31 22 1 11 31 22 2 1 21 31 2Output102142Input5 4 92 3 12 4 13 4 11 2 01 51 42 1 22 1 21 42 2 1 31 42 1 41 4Output-11234NoteThe description of changes of the graph in the first sample case:The description of changes of the graph in the second sample case:",
