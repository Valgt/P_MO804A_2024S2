Binary String Partitiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call a string $$$t$$$ consisting of characters0and/or1beautiful, if either the number of occurrences of character0in this string does not exceed $$$k$$$, or the number of occurrences of characters1in this string does not exceed $$$k$$$ (or both). For example, if $$$k = 3$$$, the strings101010,111,0,00000,1111111000arebeautiful, and the strings1111110000,01010101are notbeautiful.You are given a string $$$s$$$. You have to divide it into the minimum possible number ofbeautifulstrings, i. e., find a sequence of strings $$$t_1, t_2, \\\\dots, t_m$$$ such that every $$$t_i$$$ isbeautiful, $$$t_1 + t_2 + \\\\dots + t_m = s$$$ (where $$$+$$$ is the concatenation operator), and $$$m$$$ is minimum possible.For every $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$|s|$$$, find the minimum possible number of strings such that $$$s$$$ can be divided into them (i. e. the minimum possible $$$m$$$ in the partition).InputThe only line contains one string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$). Each character of $$$s$$$ is either0or1.OutputPrint $$$|s|$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer should be equal to the minimum number of strings in the partition of $$$s$$$, when $$$k = i$$$.ExamplesInput00100010Output2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1Input1001011100Output3 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1",
