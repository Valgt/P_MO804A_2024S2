Each cell of this grid should be colored either black or white.Two cells are considered neighbours if they have acommon borderand share the same color. Two cells $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ belong to the same component if they are neighbours, or if there is a neighbour of $$$A$$$ that belongs to the same component with $$$B$$$.Let's call some bicoloringbeautifulif it has exactly $$$k$$$ components.Count the number ofbeautifulbicolorings.
