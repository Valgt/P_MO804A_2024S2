For each query you need to print the minimum distance between such pair of elementsaxanday(x≠y), that:both indexes of the elements lie within range [lj,rj], that is,lj≤x,y≤rj;the values of the elements are equal, that isax=ay.The text above understands distance as|x-y|.InputThe first line of the input contains a pair of integersn,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 5·105) — the length of the sequence and the number of queries, correspondingly.The second line contains the sequence of integersa1,a2, ...,an(- 109≤ai≤ 109).Nextmlines contain the queries, one per line.
