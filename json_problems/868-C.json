Qualification Roundstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSnark and Philip are preparing the problemset for the upcoming pre-qualification round for semi-quarter-finals. They have a bank ofnproblems, and they want to select any non-empty subset of it as a problemset.kexperienced teams are participating in the contest. Some of these teams already know some of the problems. To make the contest interesting for them, each of the teams should know at most half of the selected problems.Determine if Snark and Philip can make an interesting problemset!InputThe first line contains two integersn,k(1 ≤n≤ 105,1 ≤k≤ 4) — the number of problems and the number of experienced teams.Each of the nextnlines containskintegers, each equal to0or1. Thej-th number in thei-th line is1ifj-th team knowsi-th problem and0otherwise.OutputPrint \"YES\" (quotes for clarity), if it is possible to make an interesting problemset, and \"NO\" otherwise.You can print each character either upper- or lowercase (\"YeS\" and \"yes\" are valid when the answer is \"YES\").ExamplesInput5 31 0 11 1 01 0 01 0 01 0 0OutputNOInput3 21 01 10 1OutputYESNoteIn the first example you can't make any interesting problemset, because the first team knows all problems.In the second example you can choose the first and the third problems.",
