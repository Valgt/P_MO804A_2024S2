Another Problem About Dividing Numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. In one turn, you can do one of the following operations:Take an integer $$$c$$$ ($$$c > 1$$$ and$$$a$$$ should be divisible by $$$c$$$) and replace $$$a$$$ with $$$\\\\frac{a}{c}$$$;Take an integer $$$c$$$ ($$$c > 1$$$ and$$$b$$$ should be divisible by $$$c$$$) and replace $$$b$$$ with $$$\\\\frac{b}{c}$$$.Your goal is to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$ using exactly $$$k$$$ turns.For example, the numbers $$$a=36$$$ and $$$b=48$$$ can be made equal in $$$4$$$ moves:$$$c=6$$$, divide $$$b$$$ by $$$c$$$ $$$\\\\Rightarrow$$$ $$$a=36$$$, $$$b=8$$$;$$$c=2$$$, divide $$$a$$$ by $$$c$$$ $$$\\\\Rightarrow$$$ $$$a=18$$$, $$$b=8$$$;$$$c=9$$$, divide $$$a$$$ by $$$c$$$ $$$\\\\Rightarrow$$$ $$$a=2$$$, $$$b=8$$$;$$$c=4$$$, divide $$$b$$$ by $$$c$$$ $$$\\\\Rightarrow$$$ $$$a=2$$$, $$$b=2$$$.For the given numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, determine whether it is possible to make them equal using exactly $$$k$$$ turns.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case is contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b, k \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case output:\"Yes\", if it is possible to make the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal inexactly$$$k$$$ turns;\"No\" otherwise.The strings \"Yes\" and \"No\" can be output in any case.ExampleInput8 36 48 2 36 48 3 36 48 4 2 8 1 2 8 2 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1 2 1 2 2 1OutputYES YES YES YES YES NO YES NO",
