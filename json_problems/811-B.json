    "statement": "B. Vladik and Complicated Booktime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVladik had started reading a complicated book about algorithms containingnpages. To improve understanding of what is written, his friends advised him to read pages in some order given by permutationP= [p1,p2, ...,pn], wherepidenotes the number of page that should be readi-th in turn.Sometimes Vladik’s mom sorted some subsegment of permutationPfrom positionlto positionrinclusive, because she loves the order. For every of such sorting Vladik knows numberx— what index of page in permutation he should read. He is wondered if the page, which he will read after sorting, has changed. In other words, haspxchanged? After every sorting Vladik return permutation to initial state, so you can assume that each sorting is independent from each other.InputFirst line contains two space-separated integersn,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 104) — length of permutation and number of times Vladik's mom sorted some subsegment of the book.Second line containsnspace-separated integersp1,p2, ...,pn(1 ≤pi≤n) — permutationP. Note that elements in permutation are distinct.Each of the nextmlines contains three space-separated integersli,ri,xi(1 ≤li≤xi≤ri≤n) — left and right borders of sorted subsegment ini-th sorting and position that is interesting to Vladik.OutputFor each mom’s sorting on it’s own line print \"Yes\", if page which is interesting to Vladik hasn't changed, or \"No\" otherwise.ExamplesInput5 55 4 3 2 11 5 31 3 12 4 34 4 42 5 3OutputYesNoYesYesNoInput6 51 4 3 2 5 62 4 31 6 24 5 41 3 32 6 3OutputYesNoYesNoYesNoteExplanation of first test case:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]— permutation after sorting,3-rd element hasn’t changed, so answer is \"Yes\".[3, 4, 5, 2, 1]— permutation after sorting,1-st element has changed, so answer is \"No\".[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]— permutation after sorting,3-rd element hasn’t changed, so answer is \"Yes\".[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]— permutation after sorting,4-th element hasn’t changed, so answer is \"Yes\".[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]— permutation after sorting,3-rd element has changed, so answer is \"No\".",
