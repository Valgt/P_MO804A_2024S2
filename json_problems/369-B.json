Especially in programming contests. Today he has participated in the contest with his team, consisting ofnstudents (including Valera). This contest was an individual competition, so each student in the team solved problems individually.After the contest was over, Valera was interested in results. He found out that:each student in the team scored at leastlpoints and at mostrpoints;in total, all members of the team scored exactlysallpoints;the total score of thekmembers of the team who scored the most points is equal to exactlysk; more formally, ifa1,a2, ...,anis the sequence of points earned by the team of students in the non-increasing order(a1≥a2≥ ... ≥an), thensk=a1+a2+ ... +ak.However, Valera did not find out exactly how many points each ofnstudents scored. Valera asked you to recover any distribution of scores between the students of the team, such that all the conditions above are met.InputThe first line of the input contains exactly six integersn,k,l,r,sall,sk(1 ≤n,k,l,r≤ 1000;l≤r;k≤n;1 ≤sk≤sall≤ 106).It's guaranteed that the input is such that the answer exists.OutputPrint exactlynintegersa1,a2, ...,an— the number of points each student scored. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them. You can print the distribution of points in any order.ExamplesInput5 3 1 3 13 9Output2 3 2 3 3Input5 3 1 3 15 9Output3 3 3 3 3",
