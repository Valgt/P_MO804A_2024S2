Edge coloring of bipartite graphtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an undirected bipartite graph without multiple edges. You should paint the edges of graph to minimal number of colours, so that no two adjacent edges have the same colour.InputThe first line contains three integersa,b,m(1 ≤a,b≤ 1000,0 ≤m≤ 105),ais the size of the first part,bis the size of the second part,mis the number of edges in the graph.Each of the nextmlines contains two integersx,y(1 ≤x≤a, 1 ≤y≤b), wherexis the number of the vertex in the first part andyis the number of the vertex in the second part. It is guaranteed that there are no multiple edges.OutputIn the first line print integerc— the minimal number of colours. The second line should containmintegers from1toc— the colours of the edges (in the order they appear in the input).If there are several solutions, you can print any one of them.ExamplesInput4 3 51 22 23 24 14 3Output31 2 3 1 2",
