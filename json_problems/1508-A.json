Binary Literaturetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA bitstring is a string that contains only the characters0and1.Koyomi Kanou is working hard towards her dream of becoming a writer. To practice, she decided to participate in theBinary Novel Writing Contest. The writing prompt for the contest consists of three bitstrings of length $$$2n$$$. A valid novel for the contest is a bitstring of length at most $$$3n$$$ that containsat least twoof the three given strings as subsequences.Koyomi has just received the three prompt strings from the contest organizers. Help her write a valid novel for the contest.A string $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero) characters.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$).Each of the following three lines contains a bitstring of length $$$2n$$$. It is guaranteed that these three strings are pairwise distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single line containing a bitstring of length at most $$$3n$$$ that has at least two of the given bitstrings as subsequences.It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, such a bitstring always exists.If there are multiple possible answers, you may output any of them.ExampleInput2 1 00 11 01 3 011001 111010 010001Output010 011001010NoteIn the first test case, the bitstrings00and01are subsequences of the output string:010and010. Note that11is not a subsequence of the output string, but this is not required.In the second test case all three input strings are subsequences of the output string:011001010,011001010and011001010.",
