The T-shirt size is either a stringMor a string consisting of several (possibly zero) charactersXand one of the charactersSorL.For example, stringsM,XXL,S,XXXXXXXScould be the size of some T-shirts. And the stringsXM,LL,SXare not sizes.The letterMstands for medium,Sfor small,Lfor large. The letterXrefers to the degree of size (from eXtra). For example,XXLis extra-extra-large (bigger thanXL, and smaller thanXXXL).You need to compare two given sizes of T-shirts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.The T-shirts are compared as follows:any small size (no matter how many lettersX) is smaller than the medium size and any large size;any large size (regardless of the number of lettersX) is larger than the medium size and any small size;the more lettersXbeforeS, the smaller the size;the more lettersXin front ofL, the larger the size.For example:XXXS<XSXXXL>XLXL>MXXL=XXLXXXXXS<MXL>XXXSInputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line, in which $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ T-shirt sizes are written. The lengths of the strings corresponding to the T-shirt sizes do not exceed $$$50$$$. It is guaranteed that all sizes are correct.OutputFor each test case, print on a separate line the result of comparing $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ T-shirt sizes (lines \"<\", \">\" or \"=\" without quotes).ExampleInput6XXXS XSXXXL XLXL MXXL XXLXXXXXS ML MOutput< > > = < >",
