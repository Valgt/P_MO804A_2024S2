To make it seems that there are many benches it was decided to place them on as many paths as possible. Obviously this requirement is satisfied by the following scheme: each bench is placed on a cross of paths and each path contains not more than one bench.Help the park administration count the number of ways to place the benches.InputThe only line of the input contains one integern(5 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of east to west paths and north to south paths.OutputOutput one integer — the number of ways to place the benches.ExamplesInput5Output120",
