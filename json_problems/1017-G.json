In this mission, Juliana has a rooted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. Vertex number $$$1$$$ is the root of this tree. Each vertex can be either black or white. At first, all vertices are white. Juliana is asked to process $$$q$$$ queries. Each query is one of three types:If vertex $$$v$$$ is white, mark it as black; otherwise, perform this operation on all direct sons of $$$v$$$ instead.Mark all vertices in the subtree of $$$v$$$ (including $$$v$$$) as white.Find the color of the $$$i$$$-th vertex.An example of operation \"1 1\" (corresponds to the first example test). The vertices $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ are already black, so the operation goes to their sons instead.Can you help Juliana to process all these queries?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2\\\\leq n\\\\leq 10^5$$$, $$$1\\\\leq q\\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices and the number of queries.The second line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq p_i<i$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ means that there is an edge between vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$p_i$$$.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$t_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t_i\\\\leq 3$$$, $$$1\\\\leq v_i\\\\leq n$$$) — the type of the $$$i$$$-th query and the vertex of the $$$i$$$-th query.It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.OutputFor each query of type $$$3$$$, print \"black\" if the vertex is black; otherwise, print \"white\".ExamplesInput8 101 2 1 2 5 4 51 23 23 11 11 13 53 73 42 23 5OutputblackwhiteblackwhiteblackwhiteInput8 111 1 2 3 3 6 61 11 11 33 23 43 63 72 31 63 73 6OutputblackwhiteblackwhitewhiteblackNoteThe first example is shown on the picture below.The second example is shown on the picture below.",
