He loves his company very much and he thinks that his company should be the best. That is why every candidate needs to pass through the interview that consists of the following problem.We define functionf(x,l,r)as a bitwise OR of integersxl,xl+ 1, ...,xr, wherexiis thei-th element of the arrayx. You are given two arraysaandbof lengthn. You need to determine the maximum value of sumf(a,l,r) +f(b,l,r)among all possible1 ≤l≤r≤n.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 1000) — the length of the arrays.The second line containsnintegersai(0 ≤ai≤ 109).The third line containsnintegersbi(0 ≤bi≤ 109).OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum value of sumf(a,l,r) +f(b,l,r)among all possible1 ≤l≤r≤n.ExamplesInput51 2 4 3 22 3 3 12 1Output22Input1013 2 7 11 8 4 9 8 5 15 7 18 9 2 3 0 11 8 6Output46NoteBitwise OR of two non-negative integersaandbis the numberc=aORb, such that each of its digits in binary notation is1if and only if at least one ofaorbhave1in the corresponding position in binary notation.In the first sample, one of the optimal answers isl= 2andr= 4, becausef(a, 2, 4) +f(b, 2, 4) = (2OR4OR3) + (3OR3OR12) = 7 + 15 = 22.
