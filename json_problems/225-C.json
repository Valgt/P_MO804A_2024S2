Your task is to change the colors of as few pixels as possible to obtain a barcode picture.A picture is a barcode if the following conditions are fulfilled:All pixels in each column are of the same color.The width of each monochrome vertical line is at leastxand at mostypixels. In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less thanxor greater thany.InputThe first line contains four space-separated integersn,m,xandy(1 ≤n,m,x,y≤ 1000;x≤y).Then follownlines, describing the original image. Each of these lines contains exactlymcharacters. Character \".\" represents a white pixel and \"#\" represents a black pixel. The picture description doesn't have any other characters besides \".\" and \"#\".OutputIn the first line print the minimum number of pixels to repaint.
