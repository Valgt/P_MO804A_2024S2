The boy cannot sit and do nothing, he decided to study an array. Sereja took a piece of paper and wrote outmintegersl1,l2, ...,lm(1 ≤li≤n). For each numberlihe wants to know how many distinct numbers are staying on the positionsli,li+ 1, ...,n. Formally, he want to find the number of distinct numbers amongali,ali+ 1, ...,an.?Sereja wrote out the necessary array elements but the array was so large and the boy was so pressed for time. Help him, find the answer for the described question for eachli.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 105).
