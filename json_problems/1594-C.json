Make Them Equaltime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTheofanis has a string $$$s_1 s_2 \\\\dots s_n$$$ and a character $$$c$$$. He wants to make all characters of the string equal to $$$c$$$ using the minimum number of operations.In one operation he can choose a number $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le n$$$) andfor every position $$$i$$$, where $$$i$$$ isnotdivisible by $$$x$$$, replace $$$s_i$$$ with $$$c$$$.Find the minimum number of operations required to make all the characters equal to $$$c$$$ and the $$$x$$$-s that he should use in his operations.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) and a lowercase Latin letter $$$c$$$ — the length of the string $$$s$$$ and the character the resulting string should consist of.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of lowercase Latin letters — the initial string.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, firstly print one integer $$$m$$$ — the minimum number of operations required to make all the characters equal to $$$c$$$.Next, print $$$m$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_j \\\\le n$$$) — the $$$x$$$-s that should be used in the order they are given.It can be proved that under given constraints, an answer always exists.
