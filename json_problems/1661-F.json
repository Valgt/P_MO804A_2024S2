Teleporterstime limit per test7 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n+1$$$ teleporters on a straight line, located in points $$$0$$$, $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$a_3$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$. It's possible to teleport from point $$$x$$$ to point $$$y$$$ if there are teleporters inbothof those points, and it costs $$$(x-y)^2$$$ energy.You want to install some additional teleporters so that it is possible to get from the point $$$0$$$ to the point $$$a_n$$$ (possibly through some other teleporters) spendingno morethan $$$m$$$ energy in total. Each teleporter you install must be located in aninteger point.What is the minimum number of teleporters you have to install?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < \\\\dots < a_n \\\\le 10^9$$$).The third line contains one integer $$$m$$$ ($$$a_n \\\\le m \\\\le 10^{18}$$$).OutputPrint one integer â€” the minimum number of teleporters you have to install so that it is possible to get from $$$0$$$ to $$$a_n$$$ spending at most $$$m$$$ energy. It can be shown that it's always possible under the constraints from the input format.ExamplesInput2 1 5 7Output2Input2 1 5 6Output3Input1 5 5Output4Input1 1000000000 1000000043Output999999978",
