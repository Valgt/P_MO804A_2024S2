Initially a single variable $$$x$$$ is assigned to $$$0$$$. Afterwards, the instructions are of two types:increase $$$x$$$ by $$$1$$$;decrease $$$x$$$ by $$$1$$$.You are given $$$m$$$ queries of the following format:query $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ — how many distinct values is $$$x$$$ assigned to if all the instructions between the $$$l$$$-th one and the $$$r$$$-th one inclusive are ignored and the rest are executed without changing the order?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases.Then the description of $$$t$$$ testcases follows.The first line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of instructions in the program and the number of queries.The second line of each testcase contains a program — a string of $$$n$$$ characters: each character is either '+' or '-' — increment and decrement instruction, respectively.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$) — the description of the query.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$. The sum of $$$m$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase print $$$m$$$ integers — for each query $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ print the number of distinct values variable $$$x$$$ is assigned to if all the instructions between the $$$l$$$-th one and the $$$r$$$-th one inclusive are ignored and the rest are executed without changing the order.ExampleInput2 8 4 -+--+--+ 1 8 2 8 2 5 1 1 4 10 +-++ 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 3 2 3 3 3 1 4 2 4 3 4 4 4Output1 2 4 4 3 3 4 2 3 2 1 2 2 2NoteThe instructions that remain for each query of the first testcase are:empty program — $$$x$$$ was only equal to $$$0$$$;\"-\" — $$$x$$$ had values $$$0$$$ and $$$-1$$$;\"---+\" — $$$x$$$ had values $$$0$$$, $$$-1$$$, $$$-2$$$, $$$-3$$$, $$$-2$$$ — there are $$$4$$$ distinct values among them;\"+--+--+\" — the distinct values are $$$1$$$, $$$0$$$, $$$-1$$$, $$$-2$$$.",
