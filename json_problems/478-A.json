Each person gives some non-zero number of coinsbas an initial bet. After all players make their bets ofbcoins, the following operation is repeated for several times: a coin is passed from one player to some other player.Your task is to write a program that can, given the number of coins each player has at the end of the game, determine the sizebof the initial bet or find out that such outcome of the game cannot be obtained for any positive number of coinsbin the initial bet.InputThe input consists of a single line containing five integersc1,c2,c3,c4andc5— the number of coins that the first, second, third, fourth and fifth players respectively have at the end of the game (0 ≤c1,c2,c3,c4,c5≤ 100).OutputPrint the only line containing a single positive integerb— the number of coins in the initial bet of each player. If there is no such value ofb, then print the only value \"-1\" (quotes for clarity).ExamplesInput2 5 4 0 4Output3Input4 5 9 2 1Output-1NoteIn the first sample the following sequence of operations is possible:One coin is passed from the fourth player to the second player;One coin is passed from the fourth player to the fifth player;One coin is passed from the first player to the third player;One coin is passed from the fourth player to the second player.",
