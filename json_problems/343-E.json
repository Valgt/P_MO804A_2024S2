    "statement": "E. Pumping Stationstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutMad scientist Mike has applied for a job. His task is to manage a system of water pumping stations.The system consists ofnpumping stations, which are numbered by integers from 1 ton. Some pairs of stations are connected by bidirectional pipes through which water can flow in either direction (but only in one at a time). For each pipe you know its bandwidth — the maximum number of liters of water that can flow through it in one hour. Each pumping station can pump incoming water from some stations to other stations through the pipes, provided that in one hour the total influx of water to the station is equal to the total outflux of water from the station.It is Mike's responsibility to pump water between stations. From stationato stationbthrough the pipes (possibly through other stations) within one hour one can transmit a certain number of liters of water according to the rules described above. During this time, water from other stations can not flow into stationa, and can not flow out of the stationb. However, any amount of water can flow out of stationaor in stationb. If a total ofxlitres of water flows out of the stationain an hour, then Mike getsxbollars more to his salary.To get paid, Mike needs to work forn- 1days, according to the contract. On the first day he selects two stationsv1andv2, and within one hour he pumps a certain amount of water fromv1tov2. Next, on thei-th day Mike chooses a stationvi+ 1that has been never selected before, and pumps a certain amount of water out of the stationvito stationvi+ 1for one hour. The quantity of water he pumps on thei-th daydoes not dependon the amount of water pumped on the(i- 1)-th day.Mike needs to earn as much bollars as he can for his projects. Help Mike find such a permutation of station numbersv1,v2,...,vnso Mike will be able to earn the highest possible salary.InputThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integersnandm(2 ≤n≤ 200,1 ≤m≤ 1000) — the number of stations and pipes in the system, accordingly. Thei-th of the nextmlines contains three space-separated integersai,biandci(1 ≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi,1 ≤ci≤ 100) — the numbers of stations connected by thei-th pipe and the pipe's bandwidth, accordingly. It is guaranteed that any two stations are connected by at most one pipe and that there is a pipe path between any two stations.OutputOn the first line print a single integer — the maximum salary Mike can earn.On the second line print a space-separated permutation ofnnumbers from 1 ton— the numbers of stations in the sequencev1,v2,...,vn. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput6 111 2 101 6 82 3 42 5 22 6 33 4 53 5 43 6 24 5 74 6 25 6 3Output776 2 1 5 3 4",
