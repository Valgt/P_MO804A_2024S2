Create The Teamstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ programmers that you want to split into several non-empty teams. The skill of the $$$i$$$-th programmer is $$$a_i$$$. You want to assemble the maximum number of teams from them. There is a restriction for each team: the number of programmers in the team multiplied by the minimum skill among all programmers in the team must be at least $$$x$$$.Each programmer should belong to at most one team. Some programmers may be left without a team.Calculate the maximum number of teams that you can assemble.InputThe first line contains the integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5; 1 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the number of programmers and the restriction of team skill respectively.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots , a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the skill of the $$$i$$$-th programmer.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all inputs does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print one integer — the maximum number of teams that you can assemble.ExampleInput3 5 10 7 11 2 9 5 4 8 2 4 2 3 4 11 1 3 3 7Output2 1 0",
