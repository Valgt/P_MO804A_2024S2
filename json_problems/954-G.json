Castle Defensetime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputToday you are going to lead a group of elven archers to defend the castle that is attacked by an army of angry orcs. Three sides of the castle are protected by impassable mountains and the remaining side is occupied by a long wall that is split intonsections. At this moment there are exactlyaiarchers located at thei-th section of this wall. You know that archer who stands at sectionican shoot orcs that attack section located at distance not exceedingr, that is all such sectionsjthat|i-j| ≤r. In particular,r= 0means that archers are only capable of shooting at orcs who attack sectioni.Denote asdefense levelof sectionithe total number of archers who can shoot at the orcs attacking this section.Reliabilityof the defense plan is the minimum value of defense level of individual wall section.There is a little time left till the attack so you can't redistribute archers that are already located at the wall. However, there is a reserve ofkarchers that you can distribute among wall sections in arbitrary way. You would like to achieve maximum possible reliability of the defence plan.InputThe first line of the input contains three integersn,randk(1 ≤n≤ 500 000,0 ≤r≤n,0 ≤k≤ 1018) — the number of sections of the wall, the maximum distance to other section archers can still shoot and the number of archers yet to be distributed along the wall. The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤ 109) — the current number of archers at each section.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum possible value of defense plan reliability, i.e. the maximum possible value of minimum defense level if we distributekadditional archers optimally.ExamplesInput5 0 65 4 3 4 9Output5Input4 2 01 2 3 4Output6Input5 1 12 1 2 1 2Output3",
