Each character is either0or1.You want all1's in the string to form a contiguous subsegment. For example, if the string is0,1,00111or01111100, then all1's form a contiguous subsegment, and if the string is0101,100001or11111111111101, then this condition is not met.You may erase some (possibly none)0's from the string. What is the minimum number of0's that you have to erase?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases.Then $$$t$$$ lines follow, each representing a test case. Each line contains one string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 100$$$); each character of $$$s$$$ is either0or1.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th integer is the answer to the $$$i$$$-th testcase (the minimum number of0's that you have to erase from $$$s$$$).ExampleInput3 010011 0 1111000Output2 0 0NoteIn the first test case you have to delete the third and forth symbols from string010011(it turns into0111).",
