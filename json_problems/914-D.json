He has an arraya1,a2, ...anofnintegers. He likes to guess the greatest common divisor (gcd) of different segments of the array. Of course, sometimes the guess is not correct. However, Bash will be satisfied if his guess isalmost correct.Suppose he guesses that the gcd of the elements in the range[l,r]ofaisx. He considers the guess to be almost correct if he can changeat mostone element in the segment such that the gcd of the segment isxafter making the change. Note that when he guesses, he doesn't actually change the array — he just wonders if the gcd of the segment can be madex. Apart from this, he also sometimes makes changes to the array itself.Since he can't figure it out himself, Bash wants you to tell him which of his guesses are almost correct. Formally, you have to processqqueries of one of the following forms:1lrx— Bash guesses that the gcd of the range[l,r]isx. Report if this guess is almost correct.2iy— Bash setsaitoy.Note:The array is1-indexed.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 5·105)  — the size of the array.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109)  — the elements of the array.The third line contains an integerq(1 ≤q≤ 4·105)  — the number of queries.The nextqlines describe the queries and may have one of the following forms:1lrx(1 ≤l≤r≤n, 1 ≤x≤ 109).2iy(1 ≤i≤n, 1 ≤y≤ 109).Guaranteed, that there is at least one query of first type.OutputFor each query of first type, output\"YES\"(without quotes) if Bash's guess is almost correct and\"NO\"(without quotes) otherwise.ExamplesInput32 6 341 1 2 21 1 3 32 1 91 1 3 2OutputYESYESNOInput51 2 3 4 561 1 4 22 3 61 1 4 21 1 5 22 5 101 1 5 2OutputNOYESNOYESNoteIn the first sample, the array initially is{2, 6, 3}.For query1, the first two numbers already have their gcd as2.For query2, we can achieve a gcd of3by changing the first element of the array to3. Note that the changes made during queries of type1are temporary and do not get reflected in the array.After query3, the array is now{9, 6, 3}.For query4, no matter which element you change, you cannot get the gcd of the range to be2.",
