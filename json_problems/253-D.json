Now he needs to remember how to write English letters. He isn't sure about some of them, so he decided to train a little.He found a sheet of squared paper and began writing arbitrary English letters there. In the end Vasya wrotenlines containingmcharacters each. Thus, he got a rectangularn×mtable, each cell of the table contained some English letter. Let's number the table rows from top to bottom with integers from 1 ton, and columns — from left to right with integers from 1 tom.After that Vasya looked at the resulting rectangular table and wondered, how many subtables are there, that matches both following conditions:the subtable contains at mostkcells with \"a\" letter;all letters, located in all four corner cells of the subtable, are equal.Formally, a subtable's definition is as follows. It is defined by four integersx1,y1,x2,y2such that1 ≤x1<x2≤n,1 ≤y1<y2≤m. Then the subtable contains all such cells(x,y)(xis the row number,yis the column number), for which the following inequality holdsx1≤x≤x2,y1≤y≤y2. The corner cells of the table are cells(x1,y1),(x1,y2),(x2,y1),(x2,y2).Vasya is already too tired after he's been writing letters to a piece of paper. That's why he asks you to count the value he is interested in.InputThe first line contains three integersn,m,k(2 ≤n,m≤ 400; 0 ≤k≤n·m).Nextnlines containmcharacters each — the given table. Each character of the table is a lowercase English letter.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of required subtables.ExamplesInput3 4 4aabbbaabbaabOutput2Input4 5 1ababaccacaccacbcbabcOutput1NoteThere are two suitable subtables in the first sample: the first one's upper left corner is cell(2, 2)and lower right corner is cell(3, 3), the second one's upper left corner is cell(2, 1)and lower right corner is cell(3, 4).",
