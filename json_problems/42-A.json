He got bad mark in algebra and was therefore forced to do some work in the kitchen, namely to cook borscht (traditional Russian soup). This should also improve his algebra skills.According to the borscht recipe it consists ofningredients that have to be mixed in proportionlitres (thus, there should bea1·x, ...,an·xlitres of corresponding ingredients mixed for some non-negativex). In the kitchen Volodya found out that he hasb1, ...,bnlitres of these ingredients at his disposal correspondingly. In order to correct his algebra mistakes he ought to cook as much soup as possible in aVlitres volume pan (which means the amount of soup cooked can be between0andVlitres). What is the volume of borscht Volodya will cook ultimately?InputThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integersnandV(1 ≤n≤ 20, 1 ≤V≤ 10000). The next line containsnspace-separated integersai(1 ≤ai≤ 100). Finally, the last line containsnspace-separated integersbi(0 ≤bi≤ 100).OutputYour program should output just one real number — the volume of soup that Volodya will cook. Your answer must have a relative or absolute error less than10- 4.ExamplesInput1 100140Output40.0Input2 1001 125 30Output50.0Input2 1001 160 60Output100.0",
