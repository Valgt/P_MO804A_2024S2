The test can be described as an array of integers $$$n$$$ and a task on it:Given an integer $$$x$$$, Sakurako can perform the following operation any number of times:Choose an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\\\le i\\\\le n$$$) such that $$$a_i\\\\ge x$$$;Change the value of $$$a_i$$$ to $$$a_i-x$$$.Using this operation any number of times, she must find the minimum possible median$$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$$ of the array $$$a$$$.Sakurako knows the array but does not know the integer $$$x$$$. Someone let it slip that one of the $$$q$$$ values of $$$x$$$ will be in the next test, so Sakurako is asking you what the answer is for each such $$$x$$$.$$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$$The median of an array of length $$$n$$$ is the element that stands in the middle of the sorted array (at the $$$\\\\frac{n+2}{2}$$$-th position for even $$$n$$$, and at the $$$\\\\frac{n+1}{2}$$$-th for odd)InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n,q\\\\le 10^5$$$)  — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le a_i\\\\le n$$$)  — the elements of the array.The following $$$q$$$ lines each contain one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1\\\\le x\\\\le n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. The same guarantee applies to the sum of $$$q$$$ across all test cases.OutputFor each test case, output $$$q$$$ integers  — the answer for each query.ExampleInput25 51 2 3 4 5123456 31 2 6 4 1 3215Output0 1 1 1 2  1 0 2",
