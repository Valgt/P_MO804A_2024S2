Make Them Equaltime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.You can choose any non-negative integer $$$D$$$ (i.e. $$$D \\\\ge 0$$$), and for each $$$a_i$$$ you can:add $$$D$$$ (only once), i. e. perform $$$a_i := a_i + D$$$, orsubtract $$$D$$$ (only once), i. e. perform $$$a_i := a_i - D$$$, orleave the value of $$$a_i$$$ unchanged.It is possible that after an operation the value $$$a_i$$$ becomes negative.Your goal is to choose suchminimum non-negative integer$$$D$$$ and perform changes in such a way, that all $$$a_i$$$ are equal (i.e. $$$a_1=a_2=\\\\dots=a_n$$$).Print the required $$$D$$$ or, if it is impossible to choose such value $$$D$$$, print-1.For example, for array $$$[2, 8]$$$ the value $$$D=3$$$ is minimum possible because you can obtain the array $$$[5, 5]$$$ if you will add $$$D$$$ to $$$2$$$ and subtract $$$D$$$ from $$$8$$$. And for array $$$[1, 4, 7, 7]$$$ the value $$$D=3$$$ is also minimum possible. You can add it to $$$1$$$ and subtract it from $$$7$$$ and obtain the array $$$[4, 4, 4, 4]$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 100$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$.OutputPrint one integer — theminimum non-negative integervalue $$$D$$$ such that if you add this value to some $$$a_i$$$, subtract this value from some $$$a_i$$$ and leave some $$$a_i$$$ without changes, all obtained values become equal.If it is impossible to choose such value $$$D$$$, print-1.ExamplesInput6 1 4 4 7 4 1Output3Input5 2 2 5 2 5Output3Input4 1 3 3 7Output-1Input2 2 8Output3",
