He still remembers the numbersXandd. He now wants you to construct any such array which will satisfy the above conditions. All the numbers in the final array should be positive integers less than1018.Note the number of elements in the output array should not be more than104. If no answer is possible, print- 1.InputThe only line of input consists of two space separated integersXandd(1 ≤X,d≤ 109).OutputOutput should consist of two lines.First line should contain a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 10 000)— the number of integers in the final array.Second line should consist ofnspace separated integers —a1,a2, ... ,an(1 ≤ai< 1018).If there is no answer, print a single integer-1.
