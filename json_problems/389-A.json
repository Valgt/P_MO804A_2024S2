Fox and Number Gametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutFox Ciel is playing a game with numbers now.Ciel hasnpositive integers:x1,x2, ...,xn. She can do the following operation as many times as needed: select two different indexesiandjsuch thatxi>xjhold, and then apply assignmentxi=xi-xj. The goal is to make the sum of all numbers as small as possible.Please help Ciel to find this minimal sum.InputThe first line contains an integern(2 ≤n≤ 100). Then the second line containsnintegers:x1,x2, ...,xn(1 ≤xi≤ 100).OutputOutput a single integer — the required minimal sum.ExamplesInput21 2Output2Input32 4 6Output6Input212 18Output12Input545 12 27 30 18Output15NoteIn the first example the optimal way is to do the assignment:x2=x2-x1.In the second example the optimal sequence of operations is:x3=x3-x2,x2=x2-x1.",
