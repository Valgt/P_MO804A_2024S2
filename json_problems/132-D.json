Constants in the language of Shakespearetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutShakespeare is a widely known esoteric programming language in which programs look like plays by Shakespeare, and numbers are given by combinations of ornate epithets. In this problem we will have a closer look at the way the numbers are described in Shakespeare.Each constant in Shakespeare is created from non-negative powers of 2 using arithmetic operations. For simplicity we'll allow only addition and subtraction and will look for a representation of the given number which requires a minimal number of operations.You are given an integern. You have to represent it asn=a1+a2+ ... +am, where each ofaiis a non-negative power of 2, possibly multiplied by -1. Find a representation which minimizes the value ofm.InputThe only line of input contains a positive integern, written as its binary notation. The length of the notation is at most106. The first digit of the notation is guaranteed to be 1.OutputOutput the required minimalm. After it outputmlines. Each line has to be formatted as \"+2^x\" or \"-2^x\", wherexis the power coefficient of the corresponding term. The order of the lines doesn't matter.ExamplesInput1111Output2+2^4-2^0Input1010011Output4+2^0+2^1+2^4+2^6",
