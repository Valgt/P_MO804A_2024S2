Target Practicetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA $$$10 \\\\times 10$$$ target is made out of five \"rings\" as shown. Each ring has a different point value: the outermost ring — 1 point, the next ring — 2 points, ..., the center ring — 5 points.Vlad fired several arrows at the target. Help him determine how many points he got.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of 10 lines, each containing 10 characters. Each character in the grid is either $$$\\\\texttt{X}$$$ (representing an arrow) or $$$\\\\texttt{.}$$$ (representing no arrow).OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the total number of points of the arrows.ExampleInput4X..........................X.......X..........X......................X..X..........................X................................................................................................................................................X.......................................................XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXOutput17 0 5 220NoteIn the first test case, there are three arrows on the outer ring worth 1 point each, two arrows on the ring worth 3 points each, and two arrows on the ring worth 4 points each.
