There arensecretaries working for the corporation, each of them corresponds via the famous Spyke VoIP system during the day. We know that when two people call each other via Spyke, the Spyke network assigns a unique ID to this call, a positive integer session number.One day Polycarpus wondered which secretaries are talking via the Spyke and which are not. For each secretary, he wrote out either the session number of his call or a 0 if this secretary wasn't talking via Spyke at that moment.Help Polycarpus analyze these data and find out the number of pairs of secretaries that are talking. If Polycarpus has made a mistake in the data and the described situation could not have taken place, say so.Note that the secretaries can correspond via Spyke not only with each other, but also with the people from other places. Also, Spyke conferences aren't permitted — that is, one call connects exactly two people.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 103)— the number of secretaries in Polycarpus's corporation. The next line containsnspace-separated integers:id1,id2, ...,idn(0 ≤idi≤ 109).
