Some cells are colored in black, all others are colored in white. In one operation you can select some rectangle and color all its cells in white. It costs $$$\\\\max(h, w)$$$ to color a rectangle of size $$$h \\\\times w$$$. You are to make all cells white for minimum total cost.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 50$$$) — the size of the square grid.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains a string of length $$$n$$$, consisting of characters '.' and '#'. The $$$j$$$-th character of the $$$i$$$-th line is '#' if the cell with coordinates $$$(i, j)$$$ is black, otherwise it is white.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum total cost to paint all cells in white.ExamplesInput3 ### #.# ###Output3Input3 ... ... ...Output0Input4 #... .... .... #...Output2Input5 #...# .#.#. ..... .#... #....Output5NoteThe examples and some of optimal solutions are shown on the pictures below.",
