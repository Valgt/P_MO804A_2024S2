Each element of $$$a$$$ is $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$.Find out if an integer $$$k$$$ exists so that the following conditions are met.$$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n-1$$$, and$$$a_1 \\\\cdot a_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot a_k = a_{k+1} \\\\cdot a_{k+2} \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot a_n$$$.If there exist multiple $$$k$$$ that satisfy the given condition, print the smallest.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1000$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 2$$$).OutputFor each test case, if there is no such $$$k$$$, print $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, print the smallest possible $$$k$$$.ExampleInput362 2 1 2 1 231 2 141 1 1 1Output2 -1 1NoteFor the first test case, $$$k=2$$$ satisfies the condition since $$$a_1 \\\\cdot a_2 = a_3 \\\\cdot a_4 \\\\cdot a_5 \\\\cdot a_6 = 4$$$. $$$k=3$$$ also satisfies the given condition, but the smallest should be printed.For the second test case, there is no $$$k$$$ that satisfies $$$a_1 \\\\cdot a_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot a_k = a_{k+1} \\\\cdot a_{k+2} \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot a_n$$$For the third test case, $$$k=1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$ satisfy the given condition, so the answer is $$$1$$$.",
