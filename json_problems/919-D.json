    "statement": "D. Substringtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a graph with $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$m$$$directededges. One lowercase letter is assigned to each node. We define a path's value as the number of the most frequently occurring letter. For example, if letters on a path are \"abaca\", then the value of that path is $$$3$$$. Your task is find a path whose value is the largest.InputThe first line contains two positive integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, m \\\\leq 300\\\\,000$$$), denoting that the graph has $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$m$$$ directed edges.The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ with only lowercase English letters. The $$$i$$$-th character is the letter assigned to the $$$i$$$-th node.Then $$$m$$$ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $$$x, y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x, y \\\\leq n$$$), describing a directed edge from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$. Note that $$$x$$$ can be equal to $$$y$$$ and there can be multiple edges between $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Also the graph can be not connected.OutputOutput a single line with a single integer denoting the largest value. If the value can be arbitrarily large, output-1instead.ExamplesInput5 4abaca1 21 33 44 5Output3Input6 6xzyabc1 23 12 35 44 36 4Output-1Input10 14xzyzyzyzqx1 22 43 54 52 66 86 52 103 910 94 61 102 83 7Output4NoteIn the first sample, the path with largest value is $$$1 \\\\to 3 \\\\to 4 \\\\to 5$$$. The value is $$$3$$$ because the letter 'a' appears $$$3$$$ times.",
