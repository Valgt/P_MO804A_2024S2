Your task is to find its longest contiguous subsegment, such that it is a goodk-dsequence.InputThe first line contains three space-separated integersn,k,d(1 ≤n≤ 2·105; 0 ≤k≤ 2·105; 0 ≤d≤ 109). The second line containsnspace-separated integers:a1,a2, ...,an(- 109≤ai≤ 109) — the actual sequence.OutputPrint two space-separated integersl,r(1 ≤l≤r≤n) show that sequenceal,al+ 1, ...,aris the longest subsegment that is a goodk-dsequence.If there are multiple optimal answers, print the one with the minimum value ofl.ExamplesInput6 1 24 3 2 8 6 2Output3 5NoteIn the first test sample the answer is the subsegment consisting of numbers 2, 8, 6 — after adding number 4 and sorting it becomes sequence 2, 4, 6, 8 — the arithmetic progression with difference 2.",
