Each vertex is a reservoir which can be either empty or filled with water.The vertices of the tree are numbered from 1 tonwith the root at vertex 1. For each vertex, the reservoirs of its children are located below the reservoir of this vertex, and the vertex is connected with each of the children by a pipe through which water can flow downwards.Mike wants to do the following operations with the tree:Fill vertexvwith water. Thenvand all its children are filled with water.Empty vertexv. Thenvand all its ancestors are emptied.Determine whether vertexvis filled with water at the moment.Initially all vertices of the tree are empty.Mike has already compiled a full list of operations that he wants to perform in order. Before experimenting with the tree Mike decided to run the list through a simulation. Help Mike determine what results will he get after performing all the operations.InputThe first line of the input contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 500000) — the number of vertices in the tree. Each of the followingn- 1lines contains two space-separated numbersai,bi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi) — the edges of the tree.The next line contains a numberq(1 ≤q≤ 500000) — the number of operations to perform. Each of the followingqlines contains two space-separated numbersci(1 ≤ci≤ 3),vi(1 ≤vi≤n), whereciis the operation type (according to the numbering given in the statement), andviis the vertex on which the operation is performed.It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.OutputFor each type 3 operation print 1 on a separate line if the vertex is full, and 0 if the vertex is empty. Print the answers to queries in the order in which the queries are given in the input.ExamplesInput51 25 12 34 2121 12 33 13 23 33 41 22 43 13 33 43 5Output00010101",
