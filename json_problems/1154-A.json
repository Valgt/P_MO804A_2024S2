Restoring Three Numberstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp has guessed three positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$. He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order — their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in random order: $$$a+b$$$, $$$a+c$$$, $$$b+c$$$ and $$$a+b+c$$$.You have to guess three numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.Pay attention that some given numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ can be equal (it is also possible that $$$a=b=c$$$).InputThe only line of the input contains four positive integers $$$x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le x_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — numbers written on a board in random order. It is guaranteed that the answer exists for the given number $$$x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$$$.OutputPrint such positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ that four numbers written on a board are values $$$a+b$$$, $$$a+c$$$, $$$b+c$$$ and $$$a+b+c$$$ written in some order. Print $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ in any order. If there are several answers, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.ExamplesInput3 6 5 4Output2 1 3Input40 40 40 60Output20 20 20Input201 101 101 200Output1 100 100",
