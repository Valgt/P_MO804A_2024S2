A Colourful Prospecttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFirecrackers scare Nian the monster, but they're wayyyyy too noisy! Maybe fireworks make a nice complement.Little Tommy is watching a firework show. As circular shapes spread across the sky, a splendid view unfolds on the night of Lunar New Year's eve.A wonder strikes Tommy. How many regions are formed by the circles on the sky? We consider the sky as a flat plane. A region is a connected part of the plane with positive area, whose bound consists of parts of bounds of the circles and is a curve or several curves without self-intersections, and that does not contain any curve other than its boundaries. Note that exactly one of the regions extends infinitely.InputThe first line of input contains one integern(1 ≤n≤ 3), denoting the number of circles.The followingnlines each contains three space-separated integersx,yandr(- 10 ≤x,y≤ 10,1 ≤r≤ 10), describing a circle whose center is(x,y)and the radius isr. No two circles have the samex,yandrat the same time.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of regions on the plane.ExamplesInput30 0 12 0 14 0 1Output4Input30 0 23 0 26 0 2Output6Input30 0 22 0 21 1 2Output8NoteFor the first example,For the second example,For the third example,",
