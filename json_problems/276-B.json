Here's one of them.Two players have got a strings, consisting of lowercase English letters. They play a game that is described by the following rules:The players move in turns; In one move the player can remove an arbitrary letter from strings.If the player before his turn can reorder the letters in stringsso as to get a palindrome, this player wins. A palindrome is a string that reads the same both ways (from left to right, and vice versa). For example, string \"abba\" is a palindrome and string \"abc\" isn't.Determine which player will win, provided that both sides play optimally well — the one who moves first or the one who moves second.InputThe input contains a single line, containing strings(1 ≤ |s|  ≤  103). Stringsconsists of lowercase English letters.OutputIn a single line print word \"First\" if the first player wins (provided that both players play optimally well). Otherwise, print word \"Second\". Print the words without the quotes.ExamplesInputabaOutputFirstInputabcaOutputSecond",
