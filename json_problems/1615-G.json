Maximum Adjacent Pairstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers.You have to replace each $$$0$$$ in $$$a$$$ with an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (different elements equal to $$$0$$$ can be replaced by different integers).Thevalueof the array you obtain is the number of integers $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that the following condition holds: there exist a pair of adjacent elements equal to $$$k$$$ (i. e. there exists some $$$i \\\\in [1, n - 1]$$$ such that $$$a_i = a_{i + 1} = k$$$). If there are multiple such pairs for some integer $$$k$$$, this integer is counted in thevalueonly once.Your task is to obtain the array with the maximum possiblevalue.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le \\\\min(n, 600)$$$) — the elements of the array.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers not less than $$$1$$$ and not greater than $$$n$$$ — the array with the maximum possiblevalueyou can obtain.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput4 1 1 0 2Output1 1 2 2Input5 0 0 0 0 0Output3 1 1 3 3Input5 1 2 3 4 5Output1 2 3 4 5Input6 1 0 0 0 0 1Output1 2 3 3 1 1Input3 3 0 2Output3 2 2Input5 1 0 2 0 1Output1 2 2 1 1Input7 1 0 2 3 1 0 2Output1 2 2 3 1 1 2",
