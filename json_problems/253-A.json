They should stand in a line so that boys and girls alternated there as much as possible. Let's assume that positions in the line are indexed from left to right by numbers from 1 ton+m. Then the number of integersi(1 ≤i<n+m) such that positions with indexesiandi+ 1contain children of different genders (positionihas a girl and positioni+ 1has a boy or vice versa) must be as large as possible.Help the children and tell them how to form the line.InputThe single line of the input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 100), separated by a space.OutputPrint a line ofn+mcharacters. Print on thei-th position of the line character \"B\", if thei-th position of your arrangement should have a boy and \"G\", if it should have a girl.Of course, the number of characters \"B\" should equalnand the number of characters \"G\" should equalm. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput3 3OutputGBGBGBInput4 2OutputBGBGBBNoteIn the first sample another possible answer isBGBGBG.In the second sample answerBBGBGBis also optimal.",
