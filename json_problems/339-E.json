Each horse has its own unique number. Initially, thei-th left horse has numberi. That is, the sequence of numbers of horses in a row looks as follows (from left to right): 1, 2, 3,...,n.Xenia trains horses before the performance. During the practice sessions, she consistently gives them commands. Each command is a pair of numbersl,r(1 ≤l<r≤n). The commandl,rmeans that the horses that are on thel-th,(l+ 1)-th,(l+ 2)-th,...,r-th places from the left must be rearranged. The horses that initially stand on thel-th andr-th places will swap. The horses on the(l+ 1)-th and(r- 1)-th places will swap. The horses on the(l+ 2)-th and(r- 2)-th places will swap and so on. In other words, the horses that were on the segment[l,r]change their order to the reverse one.For example, if Xenia commandedl= 2,r= 5, and the sequence of numbers of horses before the command looked as (2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6), then after the command the sequence will be (2, 5, 4, 3, 1, 6).We know that during the practice Xenia gave at most three commands of the described form. You have got the final sequence of numbers of horses by the end of the practice. Find what commands Xenia gave during the practice. Note that you do not need to minimize the number of commands in the solution, find any valid sequence of at most three commands.InputThe first line contains an integern(2 ≤n≤ 1000)— the number of horses in the row. The second line containsndistinct integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤n), whereaiis the number of thei-th left horse in the row after the practice.OutputThe first line should contain integerk(0 ≤k≤ 3)— the number of commads Xenia gave during the practice. In each of the nextklines print two integers. In thei-th line print numbersli,ri(1 ≤li<ri≤n)— Xenia'si-th command during the practice.It is guaranteed that a solution exists. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput51 4 3 2 5Output12 4Input62 1 4 3 6 5Output31 23 45 6",
