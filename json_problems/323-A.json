Two unit cubes are considered neighbouring, if they have common face.Your task is to paint each ofk3unit cubes one of two colours (black or white), so that the following conditions must be satisfied:each white cube has exactly 2 neighbouring cubes of white color;each black cube has exactly 2 neighbouring cubes of black color.InputThe first line contains integerk(1 ≤k≤ 100), which is size of the cube.OutputPrint -1 if there is no solution. Otherwise, print the required painting of the cube consequently by layers. Print ak×kmatrix in the firstklines, showing how the first layer of the cube should be painted. In the followingklines print ak×kmatrix — the way the second layer should be painted. And so on to the lastk-th layer. Note that orientation of the cube in the space does not matter.Mark a white unit cube with symbol \"w\" and a black one with \"b\". Use the format of output data, given in the test samples. You may print extra empty lines, they will be ignored.ExamplesInput1Output-1Input2Outputbbwwbbww",
