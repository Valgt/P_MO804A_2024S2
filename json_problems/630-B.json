Moore's Lawtime limit per test0.5 secondsmemory limit per test64 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe city administration of IT City decided to fix up a symbol of scientific and technical progress in the city's main square, namely an indicator board that shows the effect of Moore's law in real time.Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every24months. The implication of Moore's law is that computer performance as function of time increases exponentially as well.You are to prepare information that will change every second to display on the indicator board. Let's assume that every second the number of transistors increases exactly1.000000011times.InputThe only line of the input contains a pair of integersn(1000 ≤n≤ 10 000) andt(0 ≤t≤ 2 000 000 000) — the number of transistors in the initial time and the number of seconds passed since the initial time.OutputOutput one number — the estimate of the number of transistors in a dence integrated circuit intseconds since the initial time. The relative error of your answer should not be greater than10- 6.ExamplesInput1000 1000000Output1011.060722383550382782399454922040",
