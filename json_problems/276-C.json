Little Girl and Maximum Sumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe little girl loves the problems on array queries very much.One day she came across a rather well-known problem: you've got an array of $$$n$$$ elements (the elements of the array are indexed starting from 1); also, there are $$$q$$$ queries, each one is defined by a pair of integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le n)$$$. You need to find for each query the sum of elements of the array with indexes from $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$, inclusive.The little girl found the problem rather boring. She decided to reorder the array elements before replying to the queries in a way that makes the sum of query replies maximum possible. Your task is to find the value of this maximum sum.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, correspondingly.The next line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) — the array elements.Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains two space-separated integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le n$$$) — the $$$i$$$-th query.OutputIn a single line print, a single integer — the maximum sum of query replies after the array elements are reordered.Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.ExamplesInput3 35 3 21 22 31 3Output25Input5 35 2 4 1 31 52 32 3Output33",
