Fake News (hard)time limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNow that you have proposed a fake post for the HC2Facebook page, Heidi wants to measure the quality of the post before actually posting it. She recently came across a (possibly fake) article about the impact of fractal structure on multimedia messages and she is now trying to measure the self-similarity of the message, which is defined aswhere the sum is over all nonempty stringspandis the number of occurences ofpinsas asubstring. (Note that the sum is infinite, but it only has a finite number of nonzero summands.)Heidi refuses to do anything else until she knows how to calculate this self-similarity. Could you please help her? (If you would like to instead convince Heidi that a finite string cannot be a fractal anyway – do not bother, we have already tried.)InputThe input starts with a line indicating the number of test casesT(1 ≤T≤ 10). After that,Ttest cases follow, each of which consists of one line containing a strings(1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100 000) composed of lowercase letters (a-z).OutputOutputTlines, every line containing one number – the answer to the corresponding test case.ExampleInput4aaabcdcccabccOutput5101412NoteA stringscontains another stringpas a substring ifpis a contiguous subsequence ofs.
