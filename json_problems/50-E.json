The equations that are included in the school curriculum, usually look simple:x2+ 2bx+c= 0whereb,care natural numbers.Petya noticed that some equations have two real roots, some of them have only one root and some equations don't have real roots at all. Moreover it turned out that several different square equations can have a common root.Petya is interested in how many different real roots have all the equations of the type described above for all the possible pairs of numbersbandcsuch that1 ≤b≤n,1 ≤c≤m. Help Petya find that number.InputThe single line contains two integersnandm.
