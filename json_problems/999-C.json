Alphabetic Removalstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters. Polycarp wants to remove exactly $$$k$$$ characters ($$$k \\\\le n$$$) from the string $$$s$$$. Polycarp uses the following algorithm $$$k$$$ times:if there is at least one letter 'a', remove the leftmost occurrence and stop the algorithm, otherwise go to next item;if there is at least one letter 'b', remove the leftmost occurrence and stop the algorithm, otherwise go to next item;...remove the leftmost occurrence of the letter 'z' and stop the algorithm.This algorithm removes a single letter from the string. Polycarp performs this algorithm exactly $$$k$$$ times, thus removing exactly $$$k$$$ characters.Help Polycarp find the resulting string.InputThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 4 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the length of the string and the number of letters Polycarp will remove.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters.OutputPrint the string that will be obtained from $$$s$$$ after Polycarp removes exactly $$$k$$$ letters using the above algorithm $$$k$$$ times.If the resulting string is empty, print nothing. It is allowed to print nothing or an empty line (line break).ExamplesInput15 3cccaabababaccbcOutputcccbbabaccbcInput15 9cccaabababaccbcOutputccccccInput1 1uOutput",
