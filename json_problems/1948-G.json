MST with Matchingtime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an undirected connected graph on $$$n$$$ vertices. Each edge of this graph has a weight; the weight of the edge connecting vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ is $$$w_{i,j}$$$ (or $$$w_{i,j} = 0$$$ if there is no edge between $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$). All weights are positive integers.You are also given a positive integer $$$c$$$.You have to build a spanning tree of this graph; i. e. choose exactly $$$(n-1)$$$ edges of this graph in such a way that every vertex can be reached from every other vertex by traversing some of the chosen edges. The cost of the spanning tree is the sum of two values:the sum of weights of all chosen edges;the maximum matching in the spanning tree (i. e. the maximum size of a set of edges such that they all belong to the chosen spanning tree, and no vertex has more than one incident edge in this set), multiplied by the given integer $$$c$$$.Find any spanning tree with the minimum cost. Since the graph is connected, there exists at least one spanning tree.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 20$$$; $$$1 \\\\le c \\\\le 10^6$$$).Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$w_{i,1}, w_{i,2}, \\\\dots, w_{i,n}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le w_{i,j} \\\\le 10^6$$$), where $$$w_{i,j}$$$ denotes the weight of the edge between $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ (or $$$w_{i,j} = 0$$$ if there is no such edge).Additional constraints on the input:for every $$$i \\\\in [1, n]$$$, $$$w_{i,i} = 0$$$;for every pair of integers $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i \\\\in [1, n]$$$ and $$$j \\\\in [1, n]$$$, $$$w_{i,j} = w_{j,i}$$$;the given graph is connected.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum cost of a spanning tree of the given graph.ExamplesInput4 100 1 8 01 0 1 08 1 0 20 0 2 0Output21Input4 50 1 8 01 0 1 08 1 0 20 0 2 0Output14NoteIn the first example, the minimum cost spanning tree consists of edges $$$(1, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3)$$$ and $$$(3, 4)$$$. The maximum matching for it is $$$1$$$.In the second example, the minimum cost spanning tree consists of edges $$$(1, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 3)$$$ and $$$(3, 4)$$$. The maximum matching for it is $$$2$$$.",
