The fence consists ofnplanks put in a line. The fence is not closed in a circle. The planks are numbered from left to right from 1 ton, thei-th plank is of heightai. All planks have the same width, the lower edge of each plank is located at the ground level.Recently a local newspaper \"Malevich and Life\" wrote that the most fashionable way to decorate a fence in the summer is to draw a fuchsia-colored rectangle on it, the lower side of the rectangle must be located at the lower edge of the fence.Vasya is delighted with this idea! He immediately bought some fuchsia-colored paint and began to decide what kind of the rectangle he should paint. Vasya is sure that the rectangle should coverkconsecutive planks. In other words, he will paint planks numberx,x+ 1,...,x+k- 1for somex(1 ≤x≤n-k+ 1). He wants to paint the rectangle of maximal area, so the rectangle height equalsminaiforx≤i≤x+k- 1,xis the number of the first colored plank.Vasya has already made up his mind that the rectangle width can be equal to one of numbers of the sequencek1,k2, ...,km. For eachkihe wants to know the expected height of the painted rectangle, provided that he selectsxfor such fence uniformly among alln-ki+ 1possible values. Help him to find the expected heights.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 106)— the number of planks in the fence. The second line contains a sequence of integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) whereaiis the height of thei-th plank of the fence.The third line contains an integerm(1 ≤m≤ 106)and the next line containsmspace-separated integersk1,k2, ...,km(1 ≤ki≤n)wherekiis the width of the desired fuchsia-colored rectangle in planks.OutputPrintmwhitespace-separated real numbers, thei-th number equals the expected value of the rectangle height, if its width in planks equalski. The value will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed10- 9.ExamplesInput33 2 131 2 3Output2.0000000000000001.5000000000000001.000000000000000Input21 131 2 1Output1.0000000000000001.0000000000000001.000000000000000NoteLet's consider the first sample test.There are three possible positions of the fence fork1= 1. For the first position(x= 1)the height is 3, for the second one(x= 2)the height is 2, for the third one(x= 3)the height is 1. As the fence position is chosen uniformly, the expected height of the fence equals;There are two possible positions of the fence fork2= 2. For the first position(x= 1)the height is 2, for the second one(x= 2)the height is 1. The expected height of the fence equals;There is the only possible position of the fence fork3= 3. The expected height of the fence equals 1.",
