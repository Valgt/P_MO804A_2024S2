Put Knight!time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputinput.txtoutputoutput.txtPetya and Gena play a very interesting game \"Put a Knight!\" on a chessboardn×nin size. In this game they take turns to put chess pieces called \"knights\" on the board so that no two knights could threat each other. A knight located in square(r,c)can threat squares(r- 1,c+ 2),(r- 1,c- 2),(r+ 1,c+ 2),(r+ 1,c- 2),(r- 2,c+ 1),(r- 2,c- 1),(r+ 2,c+ 1)and(r+ 2,c- 1)(some of the squares may be located outside the chessboard). The player who can't put a new knight during his move loses. Determine which player wins considering that both players play optimally well and Petya starts.InputThe first line contains integerT(1 ≤T≤ 100) — the number of boards, for which you should determine the winning player. NextTlines containTintegersni(1 ≤ni≤ 10000) — the sizes of the chessboards.OutputFor eachni×niboard print on a single line \"0\" if Petya wins considering both players play optimally well.
