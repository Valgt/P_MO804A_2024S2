Count, please, the number of triangles that contain a given point in the plane and their vertices are the vertices of the polygon. It is guaranteed, that the point doesn't lie on the sides and the diagonals of the polygon.InputThe first line contains integern— the number of vertices of the polygon (3 ≤n≤ 100000). The polygon description is following:nlines containing coordinates of the vertices in clockwise order (integerxandynot greater than109by absolute value). It is guaranteed that the given polygon is nondegenerate and convex (no three points lie on the same line).The next line contains integert(1 ≤t≤ 20) — the number of points which you should count the answer for. It is followed bytlines with coordinates of the points (integerxandynot greater than109by absolute value).OutputThe output should containtinteger numbers, each on a separate line, wherei-th number is the answer for thei-th point.Please, do not use%lldspecificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.
