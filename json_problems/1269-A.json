For example:the following numbers are composite: $$$1024$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$9$$$;the following numbers are not composite: $$$13$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$37$$$.You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Find two composite integers $$$a,b$$$ such that $$$a-b=n$$$.It can be proven that solution always exists.InputThe input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^7$$$): the given integer.OutputPrint two composite integers $$$a,b$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq a, b \\\\leq 10^9, a-b=n$$$).It can be proven, that solution always exists.If there are several possible solutions, you can print any.ExamplesInput1Output9 8Input512Output4608 4096",
