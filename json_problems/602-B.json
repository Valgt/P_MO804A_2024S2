Approximating a Constant Rangetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWhen Xellos was doing a practice course in university, he once had to measure the intensity of an effect that slowly approached equilibrium. A good way to determine the equilibrium intensity would be choosing a sufficiently large number of consecutive data points that seems as constant as possible and taking their average. Of course, with the usual sizes of data, it's nothing challenging — but why not make a similar programming contest problem while we're at it?You're given a sequence ofndata pointsa1, ...,an. There aren't any big jumps between consecutive data points — for each1 ≤i<n, it's guaranteed that|ai+ 1-ai| ≤ 1.A range[l,r]of data points is said to bealmost constantif the difference between the largest and the smallest value in that range is at most1. Formally, letMbe the maximum andmthe minimum value ofaiforl≤i≤r; the range[l,r]is almost constant ifM-m≤ 1.Find the length of the longest almost constant range.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 100 000) — the number of data points.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 100 000).OutputPrint a single number — the maximum length of an almost constant range of the given sequence.ExamplesInput51 2 3 3 2Output4Input115 4 5 5 6 7 8 8 8 7 6Output5NoteIn the first sample, the longest almost constant range is[2, 5]; its length (the number of data points in it) is 4.In the second sample, there are three almost constant ranges of length4:[1, 4],[6, 9]and[7, 10]; the only almost constant range of the maximum length5is[6, 10].",
