Several pairs of vessels are connected by tubes with transfusion mechanisms. One may transfer an integer amount of liters of water between two vessels connected by such tube (tube works in both directions). There might be multiple tubes between two vessels. Total number of tubes equalse. Volume of each vessel equalsvliters. Of course, the amount of the water in any vessel cannot exceedvliters in the process of transfusions.Given the initial amountsaiof water in the vessels and the desired amountsbifind a sequence of transfusions that deals with the task. Total number of transfusions must not exceed2·n2.InputFirst line of the input contains integersn,v,e(1 ≤n≤ 300,1 ≤v≤ 109,0 ≤e≤ 50000).Next two lines containnintegers each: initialaiand the desired amountsbiof water in corresponding vessels (0 ≤ai,bi≤v).Nextelines describe one tube each in the formatxy(1 ≤x,y≤n,x≠y) for a tube between vessels numberxandy. There might be multiple tubes between two vessels. You may assume that vessels are numbered from 1 tonin some way.OutputPrint \"NO\" (without quotes), if such sequence of transfusions does not exist.Otherwise print any suitable sequence in the following format. On the first line print the total number of transfusionsk(kshould not exceed2·n2).
