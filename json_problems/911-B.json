Two Cakestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut intoapieces, and the second one — intobpieces.Ivan knows that there will benpeople at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has setnplates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;No plate contains pieces of both cakes.To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible numberxsuch that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at leastxpieces of cake.Help Ivan to calculate this numberx!InputThe first line contains three integersn,aandb(1 ≤a,b≤ 100,2 ≤n≤a+b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.OutputPrint the maximum possible numberxsuch that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at leastxpieces of cake.ExamplesInput5 2 3Output1Input4 7 10Output3NoteIn the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have1cake on it.In the second example you can have two plates with3and4pieces of the first cake and two plates both with5pieces of the second cake.
