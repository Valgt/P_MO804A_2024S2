He calls an integer point(x,y)of a plane special if0 ≤x≤nand0 ≤y≤m. Jzzhu defines a unit square as a square with corners at points(x,y),(x+ 1,y),(x+ 1,y+ 1),(x,y+ 1), wherexandyare some integers.Let's look at all the squares (their sides not necessarily parallel to the coordinate axes) with corners at the special points. For each such square Jzzhu paints a dot in every unit square that is fully inside it. After that some unit squares can contain several dots. Now Jzzhu wonders, how many dots he has painted on the plane. Find this number modulo1000000007(109+ 7).InputThe first line contains a single integert(1 ≤t≤ 105)— the number of tests.Each of the nexttlines contains the description of the test: two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 106)— the value of variables for the current test.OutputFor each test output the total number of dots modulo1000000007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput41 32 22 53 4Output382658",
