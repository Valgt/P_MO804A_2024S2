The segments are closed, i.e., a segment $$$[a, b]$$$ contains the points $$$a, a+1, \\\\ldots, b$$$.You are given $$$q$$$ queries. In the $$$i$$$-th query, you are given a positive integer $$$k_i$$$, and you have to determine how many points with integer coordinates are contained in exactly $$$k_i$$$ segments.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of points and the number of queries.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x_1 < x_2 < \\\\ldots < x_n \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the coordinates of the $$$n$$$ points.The third line of each test case contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$k_1, k_2, \\\\ldots, k_q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq k_i \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$) — the parameters of the $$$q$$$ queries.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single line with $$$q$$$ integers: the $$$i$$$-th integer is the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query.ExampleInput32 2101 2002 16 151 2 3 5 6 71 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 155 8254618033 265675151 461318786 557391198 8480837786 9 15 10 6 9 4 4294967300Output0 100  0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 0  291716045 0 0 0 291716045 0 301749698 0NoteIn the first example, you only draw the segment $$$[101, 200]$$$. No point is contained in exactly $$$2$$$ segments, and the $$$100$$$ points $$$101, 102, \\\\ldots, 200$$$ are contained in exactly $$$1$$$ segment.In the second example, you draw $$$15$$$ segments: $$$[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 5], [1, 6], [1, 7], [2, 3], [2, 5], [2, 6], [2, 7], [3, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7], [5, 6], [5, 7], [6, 7]$$$. Points $$$1, 7$$$ are contained in exactly $$$5$$$ segments; points $$$2, 4, 6$$$ are contained in exactly $$$9$$$ segments; points $$$3, 5$$$ are contained in exactly $$$11$$$ segments.",
