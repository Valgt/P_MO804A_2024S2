Let's enumerate them with integers from1tonfrom the left to the right. The pearl numberihas the typeai.Let's call a sequence of consecutive pearls asegment. Let's call a segmentgoodif it contains two pearls of the same type.Split the row of the pearls to the maximal number of good segments. Note that each pearl should appear in exactly one segment of the partition.As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to usescanf/printfinstead ofcin/coutin C++, prefer to useBufferedReader/PrintWriterinstead ofScanner/System.outinJava.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 3·105) — the number of pearls in a row.The second line containsnintegersai(1 ≤ai≤ 109) – the type of thei-th pearl.OutputOn the first line print integerk— the maximal number of segments in a partition of the row.Each of the nextklines should contain two integerslj,rj(1 ≤lj≤rj≤n) — the number of the leftmost and the rightmost pearls in thej-th segment.Note you should print the correct partition of the row of the pearls, so each pearl should be in exactly one segment and all segments should contain two pearls of the same type.If there are several optimal solutions print any of them. You can print the segments in any order.If there are no correct partitions of the row print the number \"-1\".ExamplesInput51 2 3 4 1Output11 5Input51 2 3 4 5Output-1Input71 2 1 3 1 2 1Output21 34 7",
