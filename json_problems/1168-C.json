And Reachabilitytime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputToad Pimple has an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$.We say that $$$y$$$ is reachable from $$$x$$$ if $$$x<y$$$ and there exists an integer array $$$p$$$ such that $$$x = p_1 < p_2 < \\\\ldots < p_k=y$$$, and $$$a_{p_i}\\\\, \\\\&\\\\, a_{p_{i+1}} > 0$$$ for all integers $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\leq i < k$$$.Here $$$\\\\&$$$ denotes thebitwise AND operation.You are given $$$q$$$ pairs of indices, check reachability for each of them.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 300\\\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq q \\\\leq 300\\\\,000$$$) — the number of integers in the array and the number of queries you need to answer.The second line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 300\\\\,000$$$) — the given array.The next $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers each. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two space-separated integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x_i < y_i \\\\leq n$$$). You need to check if $$$y_i$$$ is reachable from $$$x_i$$$.OutputOutput $$$q$$$ lines. In the $$$i$$$-th of them print \"Shi\" if $$$y_i$$$ is reachable from $$$x_i$$$, otherwise, print \"Fou\".ExampleInput5 3 1 3 0 2 1 1 3 2 4 1 4OutputFou Shi ShiNoteIn the first example, $$$a_3 = 0$$$. You can't reach it, because AND with it is always zero. $$$a_2\\\\, \\\\&\\\\, a_4 > 0$$$, so $$$4$$$ is reachable from $$$2$$$, and to go from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ you can use $$$p = [1, 2, 4]$$$.",
