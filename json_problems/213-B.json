You've got one of his problems, the one Furik gave to Rubik. And Rubik asks you to solve it.There is integernand arraya, consisting of ten integers, indexed by numbers from 0 to 9. Your task is to count the number of positive integers with the following properties:the number's length does not exceedn;the number doesn't have leading zeroes;digiti(0 ≤i≤ 9)occurs in the number at leasta[i]times.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 100). The next line contains 10 integersa[0],a[1],...,a[9](0 ≤a[i] ≤ 100)— elements of arraya. The numbers are separated by spaces.OutputOn a single line print the remainder of dividing the answer to the problem by1000000007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1Output1Input21 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Output1Input31 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Output36NoteIn the first sample number 9 meets the requirements.In the second sample number 10 meets the requirements.In the third sample numbers10, 110, 210, 120, 103meet the requirements.
