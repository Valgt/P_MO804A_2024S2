Amr doesn't like large arrays so he intends to make it smaller.Amr doesn't care about anything in the array except the beauty of it. The beauty of the array is defined to be the maximum number of times that some number occurs in this array. He wants to choose the smallest subsegment of this array such that the beauty of it will be the same as the original array.Help Amr by choosing the smallest subsegment possible.InputThe first line contains one numbern(1 ≤n≤ 105), the size of the array.The second line containsnintegersai(1 ≤ai≤ 106), representing elements of the array.OutputOutput two integersl,r(1 ≤l≤r≤n), the beginning and the end of the subsegment chosen respectively.If there are several possible answers you may output any of them.ExamplesInput51 1 2 2 1Output1 5Input51 2 2 3 1Output2 3Input61 2 2 1 1 2Output1 5NoteA subsegmentBof an arrayAfromltoris an array of sizer-l+ 1whereBi=Al+i- 1for all1 ≤i≤r-l+ 1",
