    "statement": "D. Binary Cuttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a binary string$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$. Please find the minimum number of pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.Note that:each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces;the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string;you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement.$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$ Abinary stringis a string consisting of characters $$$\\\\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\\\\texttt{1}$$$. Asorted binary stringis a binary string such that all characters $$$\\\\texttt{0}$$$ come before all characters $$$\\\\texttt{1}$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 500$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq |s| \\\\leq 500$$$) consisting of characters $$$\\\\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\\\\texttt{1}$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ denotes the length of the string $$$s$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.ExampleInput6110100000000011000011110110Output3 1 1 2 1 2NoteThe first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you can't use fewer than $$$3$$$ pieces.In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so only $$$1$$$ piece is needed.In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two characters and rearrange them to make the string $$$\\\\texttt{01}$$$.",
