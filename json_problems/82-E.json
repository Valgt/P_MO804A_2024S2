Corridortime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutConsider a house plan.Let the house be represented by an infinite horizontal strip defined by the inequality-h≤y≤h. Strictly outside the house there are two light sources at the points(0,f)and(0,  -f). Windows are located in the walls, the windows are represented by segments on the linesy=handy=  -h. Also, the windows are arranged symmetrically about the liney= 0.Your task is to find the area of the floor at the home, which will be lighted by the sources of light.InputThe first line of the input file contains three integersn,handf(1 ≤n≤ 500,1 ≤h≤ 10,h<f≤ 1000). Next,nlines contain two integers eachli,ri(- 5000 ≤li<ri≤ 5000), each entry indicates two segments. Endpoints of the first segment are(li,h)-(ri,h), and endpoints of the second segment are(li,  -h)-(ri,  -h). These segments describe location of windows. Numbers in the lines are space-separated. It is guaranteed that no two distinct segments have common points.OutputPrint the single real number — the area of the illuminated part of the floor with an absolute or relative error of no more than10- 4.ExamplesInput1 1 2-1 1Output10.0000000000Input2 2 4-1 01 2Output23.3333333333NoteThe second sample test is shown on the figure. Green area is the desired area of the illuminated part of the floor. Violet segments indicate windows.",
