You may perform any number of swapping operations any order. There is no limit on the number of times you swapi-th element with(i+ 1)-th (if the position is not forbidden).Can you make this array sorted in ascending order performing some sequence of swapping operations?InputThe first line contains one integern(2 ≤n≤ 200000) — the number of elements in the array.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 200000) — the elements of the array.
