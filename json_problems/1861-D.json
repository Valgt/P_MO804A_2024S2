Sorting By Multiplicationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting ofpositive integers.You can perform the following operation on this array any number of times (possibly zero):choose three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ and $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$, and multiply every $$$a_i$$$ such that $$$l \\\\le i \\\\le r$$$ by $$$x$$$.Note that you can chooseanyinteger as $$$x$$$, it doesn't have to be positive.You have to calculate the minimum number of operations to make the array $$$a$$$ sorted instrictly ascendingorder (i. e. the condition $$$a_1 < a_2 < \\\\dots < a_n$$$ must be satisfied).InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$)  — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a$$$ sorted in strictly ascending order.ExampleInput351 1 2 2 265 4 3 2 5 131 2 3Output3 2 0NoteIn the first test case, we can perform the operations as follows:$$$l = 2$$$, $$$r = 4$$$, $$$x = 3$$$;$$$l = 4$$$, $$$r = 4$$$, $$$x = 2$$$;$$$l = 5$$$, $$$r = 5$$$, $$$x = 10$$$.After these operations, the array $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[1, 3, 6, 12, 20]$$$.In the second test case, we can perform one operation as follows:$$$l = 1$$$, $$$r = 4$$$, $$$x = -2$$$;$$$l = 6$$$, $$$r = 6$$$, $$$x = 1337$$$.After these operations, the array $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[-10, -8, -6, -4, 5, 1337]$$$.In the third test case, the array $$$a$$$ is already sorted.",
