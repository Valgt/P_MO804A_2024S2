Gabriel and Caterpillartime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe9-th grade student Gabriel noticed a caterpillar on a tree when walking around in a forest after the classes. The caterpillar was on the heighth1cm from the ground. On the heighth2cm (h2>h1) on the same tree hung an apple and the caterpillar was crawling to the apple.Gabriel is interested when the caterpillar gets the apple. He noted that the caterpillar goes up byacm per hour by day and slips down bybcm per hour by night.In how many days Gabriel should return to the forest to see the caterpillar get the apple. You can consider that the day starts at10am and finishes at10pm. Gabriel's classes finish at2pm. You can consider that Gabriel noticed the caterpillar just after the classes at2pm.Note that the forest is magic so the caterpillar can slip down under the ground and then lift to the apple.InputThe first line contains two integersh1,h2(1 ≤h1<h2≤ 105) — the heights of the position of the caterpillar and the apple in centimeters.The second line contains two integersa,b(1 ≤a,b≤ 105) — the distance the caterpillar goes up by day and slips down by night, in centimeters per hour.OutputPrint the only integerk— the number of days Gabriel should wait to return to the forest and see the caterpillar getting the apple.If the caterpillar can't get the apple print the only integer- 1.ExamplesInput10 302 1Output1Input10 131 1Output0Input10 191 2Output-1Input1 505 4Output1NoteIn the first example at10pm of the first day the caterpillar gets the height26. At10am of the next day it slips down to the height14. And finally at6pm of the same day the caterpillar gets the apple.Note that in the last example the caterpillar was slipping down under the ground and getting the apple on the next day.",
