Nastya and King-Shamanstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNastya likes reading and even spends whole days in a library sometimes. Today she found a chronicle of Byteland in the library, and it stated that there lived shamans long time ago. It is known that at every moment there was exactly one shaman in Byteland, and there werenshamans in total enumerated with integers from1tonin the order they lived. Also, each shaman had a magic power which can now be expressed as an integer.The chronicle includes a list of powers of thenshamans. Also, some shamans can be king-shamans, if they gathered all the power of their predecessors, i.e. their power is exactly the sum of powers of all previous shamans. Nastya is interested in whether there was at least one king-shaman in Byteland.Unfortunately many of the powers are unreadable in the list, so Nastya is doing the following:Initially she supposes some power for each shaman.After that she changes the power of some shamanqtimes (the shamans can differ) and after that wants to check if there is at least one king-shaman in the list. If yes, she wants to know the index of any king-shaman.Unfortunately the list is too large and Nastya wants you to help her.InputThe first line contains two integersnandq(1 ≤n,q≤ 2·105).The second line containsnintegersa1, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤ 109), whereaiis the magic power of thei-th shaman.After thatqlines follow, thei-th of them contains two integerspiandxi(1 ≤pi≤n,0 ≤xi≤ 109) that mean that the new power of thepi-th shaman isxi.OutputPrintqlines, thei-th of them should contain- 1, if after thei-th change there are no shaman-kings, and otherwise a single integerj, wherejis an index of some king-shaman after thei-th change.If there are multiple king-shamans after each change, print the index of any of them.ExamplesInput2 11 31 2Output-1Input3 42 2 31 11 22 43 6Output32-13Input10 70 3 1 4 6 2 7 8 10 12 51 39 364 104 91 21 0Output1-19-14-11NoteIn the first example powers of shamans after the first change are equal to(2, 3). The answer equals- 1, because the sum of powers of shamans before the first shaman is equal to0, and before the second is equal to2.In the second example after the first change the powers are equal to(1, 2, 3). The answer is equal to3, because the power of the third shaman is equal to3, and the sum of powers of the first and the second shaman is also1 + 2 = 3. After the second change the powers become equal to(2, 2, 3), where the answer equals2. After the third change the powers become equal to(2, 4, 3), where the answer equals- 1. After the fourth change the powers become equal to(2, 4, 6), where the answer equals3.",
