The village hasnhouses, indexed by integers from 1 ton. Each house has a plaque containing an integer, thei-th house has a plaque containing integerpi(1 ≤pi≤n).Little penguin Polo loves walking around this village. The walk looks like that. First he stands by a house numberx. Then he goes to the house whose number is written on the plaque of housex(that is, to housepx), then he goes to the house whose number is written on the plaque of housepx(that is, to houseppx), and so on.We know that:When the penguin starts walking from any house indexed from 1 tok, inclusive, he can walk to house number 1.When the penguin starts walking from any house indexed fromk+ 1ton, inclusive, he definitely cannot walk to house number 1.When the penguin starts walking from house number 1, he can get back to house number 1 after some non-zero number of walks from a house to a house.You need to find the number of ways you may write the numbers on the houses' plaques so as to fulfill the three above described conditions. Print the remainder after dividing this number by1000000007(109+ 7).InputThe single line contains two space-separated integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 1000, 1 ≤k≤min(8,n)) — the number of the houses and the numberkfrom the statement.OutputIn a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo1000000007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput5 2Output54Input7 4Output1728",
