    "statement": "F. Speed Dialtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp's phone book contains $$$n$$$ phone numbers, each of them is described by $$$s_i$$$ — the number itself and $$$m_i$$$ — the number of times Polycarp dials it in daily.Polycarp has just bought a brand new phone with an amazingspeed dialfeature! More precisely, $$$k$$$ buttons on it can have a number assigned to it (not necessary from the phone book). To enter some number Polycarp can press one of these $$$k$$$ buttons and then finish the number using usual digit buttons (entering a number with only digit buttons is also possible).Speed dialbutton can only be used when no digits are entered. No button can have its number reassigned.What is the minimal total number ofdigit number pressesPolycarp can achieve after he assigns numbers tospeed dialbuttons and enters each of the numbers from his phone book the given number of times in an optimal way?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 500$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10$$$) — the amount of numbers in Polycarp's phone book and the number ofspeed dialbuttons his new phone has.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contain a string $$$s_i$$$ and an integer $$$m_i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le m_i \\\\le 500)$$$, where $$$s_i$$$ is a non-empty string of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$ inclusive (the $$$i$$$-th number), and $$$m_i$$$ is the amount of times it will be dialed, respectively.It is guaranteed that the total length of all phone numbers will not exceed $$$500$$$.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimal total number ofdigit number pressesPolycarp can achieve after he assigns numbers tospeed dialbuttons and enters each of the numbers from his phone book the given number of times in an optimal way.ExamplesInput3 1 0001 5 001 4 01 1Output14Input3 1 0001 5 001 6 01 1Output18NoteThe onlyspeed dialbutton in the first example should have \"0001\" on it. The total number of digit button presses will be $$$0 \\\\cdot 5$$$ for the first number + $$$3 \\\\cdot 4$$$ for the second + $$$2 \\\\cdot 1$$$ for the third. $$$14$$$ in total.The onlyspeed dialbutton in the second example should have \"00\" on it. The total number of digit button presses will be $$$2 \\\\cdot 5$$$ for the first number + $$$1 \\\\cdot 6$$$ for the second + $$$2 \\\\cdot 1$$$ for the third. $$$18$$$ in total.",
