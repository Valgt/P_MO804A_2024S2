Bracketstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutA two dimensional array is called abracketarray if each grid contains one of the two possible brackets — \"(\" or \")\". A path through the two dimensional array cells is calledmonotonousif any two consecutive cells in the path are side-adjacent and each cell of the path is located below or to the right from the previous one.A two dimensional array whose size equalsn×mis called acorrect bracketarray, if any string formed by writing out the brackets on some monotonous way from cell(1, 1)to cell(n,m)forms a correct bracket sequence.Let's define the operation of comparing two correct bracket arrays of equal size (aandb) like that. Let's consider a given two dimensional array of priorities (c) — a two dimensional array of same size, containing different integers from1tonm. Let's find such position(i,j)in the two dimensional array, thatai,j≠bi,j. If there are several such positions, let's choose the one where numberci,jis minimum. Ifai,j=\"(\", thena<b, otherwisea>b. If the position(i,j)is not found, then the arrays are considered equal.Your task is to find ak-th two dimensional correct bracket array. It is guaranteed that for the given sizes ofnandmthere will be no less thanktwo dimensional correct bracket arrays.InputThe first line contains integersn,mandk— the sizes of the array and the number of the sought correct bracket array (1 ≤n,m≤ 100,1 ≤k≤ 1018). Then an array of priorities is given,nlines each containingmnumbers, numberpi,jshows the priority of characterjin linei(1 ≤pi,j≤nm, allpi,jare different).Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.OutputPrint thek-th two dimensional correct bracket array.ExamplesInput1 2 11 2Output()Input2 3 11 2 34 5 6Output(()())Input3 2 23 61 42 5Output())(()NoteIn the first sample exists only one correct two-dimensional bracket array.In the second and in the third samples two arrays exist.A bracket sequence is called regular if it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters «+» and «1» into this sequence. For example, sequences «(())()», «()» and «(()(()))» are regular, while «)(», «(()» and «(()))(» are not.",
