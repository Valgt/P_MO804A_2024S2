New Year and Binary Tree Pathstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe New Year tree is an infinite perfect binary tree rooted in the node1. Each nodevhas two children: nodes indexed(2·v)and(2·v+ 1).Polar bears love decorating the New Year tree and Limak is no exception. As he is only a little bear, he was told to decorate only one simple path between some pair of nodes. Though he was given an opportunity to pick the pair himself! Now he wants to know the number of unordered pairs of indices(u,v)(u≤v), such that the sum of indices of all nodes along the simple path betweenuandv(including endpoints) is equal tos. Can you help him and count this value?InputThe only line of the input contains a single integers(1 ≤s≤ 1015).OutputPrint one integer, denoting the number of unordered pairs of nodes indices defining simple paths with the sum of indices of vertices equal tos.ExampleInput10Output4NoteIn sample test, there are4paths with the sum of indices equal to10:",
