    "statement": "E. Dima and Gametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutDima and Anya love playing different games. Now Dima has imagined a new game that he wants to play with Anya.Dima writesnpairs of integers on a piece of paper(li,ri)(1 ≤li<ri≤p). Then players take turns. On his turn the player can do the following actions:choose the number of the pairi(1 ≤i≤n), such thatri-li> 2;replace pair numberiby pairor by pair. Notation⌊x⌋means rounding down to the closest integer.The player who can't make a move loses.Of course, Dima wants Anya, who will move first, to win. That's why Dima should write out suchnpairs of integers(li,ri)(1 ≤li<ri≤p), that if both players play optimally well, the first one wins. Count the number of ways in which Dima can do it. Print the remainder after dividing the answer by number1000000007 (109+ 7).Two ways are considered distinct, if theorderedsequences of the written pairs are distinct.InputThe first line contains two integersn,p(1 ≤n≤ 1000, 1 ≤p≤ 109). The numbers are separated by a single space.OutputIn a single line print the remainder after dividing the answer to the problem by number1000000007 (109+ 7).ExamplesInput2 2Output0Input4 4Output520Input100 1000Output269568947",
