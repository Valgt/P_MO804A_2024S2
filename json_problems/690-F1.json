Tree of Life (easy)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputHeidi has finally found the mythical Tree of Life – a legendary combinatorial structure which is said to contain a prophecy crucially needed to defeat the undead armies.On the surface, the Tree of Life is just a regular undirected tree well-known from computer science. This means that it is a collection ofnpoints (called vertices), some of which are connected usingn- 1line segments (edges) so that each pair of vertices is connected by apath(a sequence of one or more edges).To decipher the prophecy, Heidi needs to perform a number of steps. The first is counting the number oflifelinesin the tree – these are paths of length2, i.e., consisting of two edges. Help her!InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern– the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤n≤ 10000). The vertices are labeled with the numbers from 1 ton. Thenn- 1lines follow, each describing one edge using two space-separated numbersab– the labels of the vertices connected by the edge (1 ≤a<b≤n). It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.OutputPrint one integer – the number of lifelines in the tree.ExamplesInput41 21 31 4Output3Input51 22 33 43 5Output4NoteIn the second sample, there are four lifelines: paths between vertices1and3,2and4,2and5, and4and5.",
