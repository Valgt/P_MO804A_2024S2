Parallelogram is Backtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLong time ago Alex created an interesting problem about parallelogram. The input data for this problem contained four integer points on the Cartesian plane, that defined the set of vertices of some non-degenerate (positive area) parallelogram. Points not necessary were given in the order of clockwise or counterclockwise traversal.Alex had very nice test for this problem, but is somehow happened that the last line of the input was lost and now he has only three out of four points of the original parallelogram. He remembers that test was so good that he asks you to restore it given only these three points.InputThe input consists of three lines, each containing a pair of integer coordinatesxiandyi(- 1000 ≤xi,yi≤ 1000). It's guaranteed that these three points do not lie on the same line and no two of them coincide.OutputFirst print integerk— the number of ways to add one new integer point such that the obtained set defines some parallelogram of positive area. There is no requirement for the points to be arranged in any special order (like traversal), they just define the set of vertices.Then printklines, each containing a pair of integer — possible coordinates of the fourth point.ExampleInput0 01 00 1Output31 -1-1 11 1NoteIf you need clarification of what parallelogram is, please check Wikipedia page:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram",
