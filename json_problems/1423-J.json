Bubble Cup hypothesistime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe Bubble Cup hypothesis stood unsolved for $$$130$$$ years. Who ever proves the hypothesis will be regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of our time! A famous mathematician Jerry Mao managed to reduce the hypothesis to this problem:Given a number $$$m$$$, how many polynomials $$$P$$$ with coefficients in set $$${\\\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\\\}}$$$ have: $$$P(2)=m$$$?Help Jerry Mao solve the long standing problem!InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 5\\\\cdot 10^5)$$$ - number of test cases.On next line there are $$$t$$$ numbers, $$$m_i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq m_i \\\\leq 10^{18})$$$ - meaning that in case $$$i$$$ you should solve for number $$$m_i$$$.OutputFor each test case $$$i$$$, print the answer on separate lines: number of polynomials $$$P$$$ as described in statement such that $$$P(2)=m_i$$$, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExampleInput2 2 4Output2 4NoteIn first case, for $$$m=2$$$, polynomials that satisfy the constraint are $$$x$$$ and $$$2$$$.In second case, for $$$m=4$$$, polynomials that satisfy the constraint are $$$x^2$$$, $$$x + 2$$$, $$$2x$$$ and $$$4$$$.",
