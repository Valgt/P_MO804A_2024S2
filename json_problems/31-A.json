Recently he put forward hypotheses that all worms evolve by division. There arenforms of worms. Worms of these forms have lengthsa1,a2, ...,an. To prove his theory, professor needs to find 3 different forms that the length of the first form is equal to sum of lengths of the other two forms. Help him to do this.InputThe first line contains integern(3 ≤n≤ 100) — amount of worm's forms. The second line containsnspace-separated integersai(1 ≤ai≤ 1000) — lengths of worms of each form.OutputOutput 3 distinct integersijk(1 ≤i,j,k≤n) — such indexes of worm's forms thatai=aj+ak. If there is no such triple, output-1. If there are several solutions, output any of them. It possible thataj=ak.ExamplesInput51 2 3 5 7Output3 2 1Input51 8 1 5 1Output-1",
