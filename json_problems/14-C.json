And now, in his turn, Alex wants to boast about something to his brother. He thought for a while, and came to the conclusion that he has no ready creations, and decided to write a program for rectangles detection. According to his plan, the program detects if the four given segments form a rectangle of a positive area and with sides parallel to coordinate axes. As Alex does badly at school and can't write this program by himself, he asks you to help him.InputThe input data contain four lines. Each of these lines contains four integersx1,y1,x2,y2(- 109≤x1,y1,x2,y2≤ 109) — coordinates of segment's beginning and end positions. The given segments can degenerate into points.OutputOutput the word «YES», if the given four segments form the required rectangle, otherwise output «NO».ExamplesInput1 1 6 11 0 6 06 0 6 11 1 1 0OutputYESInput0 0 0 32 0 0 02 2 2 00 2 2 2OutputNO",
