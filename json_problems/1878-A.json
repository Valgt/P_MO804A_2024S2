How Much Does Daytona Cost?time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWe define an integer to bethe most commonon a subsegment, if its number of occurrences on that subsegment is larger than the number of occurrences of any other integer in that subsegment. A subsegment of an array is a consecutive segment of elements in the array $$$a$$$.Given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$, and an integer $$$k$$$, determine if there exists a non-empty subsegment of $$$a$$$ where $$$k$$$ isthe most common element.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of elements in array and the element which must bethe most common.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$a_3$$$, $$$\\\\dots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 100$$$) — elements of the array.OutputFor each test case output \"YES\" if there exists a subsegment in which $$$k$$$ isthe most commonelement, and \"NO\" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput75 41 4 3 4 14 12 3 4 45 643 5 60 4 22 51 54 15 3 3 11 335 33 4 1 5 5OutputYES NO NO YES YES YES YESNoteIn the first test case we need to check if there is a subsegment where themost common elementis $$$4$$$.On the subsegment $$$[2,5]$$$ the elements are $$$4, \\\\ 3, \\\\ 4, \\\\ 1$$$.$$$4$$$ appears $$$2$$$ times;$$$1$$$ appears $$$1$$$ time;$$$3$$$ appears $$$1$$$ time.This means that $$$4$$$ is themost common elementon the subsegment $$$[2, 5]$$$, so there exists a subsegment where $$$4$$$ is themost common element.",
