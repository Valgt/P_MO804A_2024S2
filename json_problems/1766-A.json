Extremely Roundtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call a positive integerextremely roundif it has only one non-zero digit. For example, $$$5000$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$10$$$, $$$200$$$ are extremely round integers; $$$42$$$, $$$13$$$, $$$666$$$, $$$77$$$, $$$101$$$ are not.You are given an integer $$$n$$$. You have to calculate the number of extremely round integers $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le n$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then, $$$t$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 999999$$$) — the description of the $$$i$$$-th test case.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the number of extremely round integers $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le n$$$.ExampleInput594213100111Output9 13 10 19 19",
