Boboniu Likes to Color Ballstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBoboniu gives you$$$r$$$ red balls,$$$g$$$ green balls,$$$b$$$ blue balls,$$$w$$$ white balls.He allows you to do the following operation as many times as you want:Pick a red ball, a green ball, and a blue ball and then change their color to white.You should answer if it's possible to arrange all the balls into apalindromeafter several (possibly zero) number of described operations.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1\\\\le T\\\\le 100$$$) denoting the number of test cases.For each of the next $$$T$$$ cases, the first line contains four integers $$$r$$$, $$$g$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$0\\\\le r,g,b,w\\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print \"Yes\" if it's possible to arrange all the balls into a palindrome after doing several (possibly zero) number of described operations. Otherwise, print \"No\".ExampleInput4 0 1 1 1 8 1 9 3 0 0 0 0 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000OutputNo Yes Yes YesNoteIn the first test case, you're not able to do any operation and you can never arrange three balls of distinct colors into a palindrome.In the second test case, after doing one operation, changing $$$(8,1,9,3)$$$ to $$$(7,0,8,6)$$$, one of those possible palindromes may be \"rrrwwwbbbbrbbbbwwwrrr\".Apalindromeis a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards. For example, \"rggbwbggr\", \"b\", \"gg\" are palindromes while \"rgbb\", \"gbbgr\" are not. Notice that anemptyword, phrase, or sequence is palindrome.",
