Tommy's lanterns have brightnessa1,a2, ...,an, and Banban's have brightnessb1,b2, ...,bmrespectively.Tommy intends to hide one of his lanterns, then Banban picks one of Tommy's non-hidden lanterns and one of his own lanterns to form a pair. The pair's brightness will be the product of the brightness of two lanterns.Tommy wants to make the product as small as possible, while Banban tries to make it as large as possible.You are asked to find the brightness of the chosen pair if both of them choose optimally.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandm(2 ≤n,m≤ 50).The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an.The third line containsmspace-separated integersb1,b2, ...,bm.All the integers range from- 109to109.OutputPrint a single integer — the brightness of the chosen pair.ExamplesInput2 220 182 14Output252Input5 3-1 0 1 2 3-1 0 1Output2NoteIn the first example, Tommy will hide20and Banban will choose18from Tommy and14from himself.In the second example, Tommy will hide3and Banban will choose2from Tommy and1from himself.",
