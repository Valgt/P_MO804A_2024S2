Circle of Numberstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputnevenly spaced points have been marked around the edge of a circle. There is a number written at each point. You choose a positive real numberk. Then you may repeatedly select a set of2or more points which are evenly spaced, and either increase all numbers at points in the set bykor decrease all numbers at points in the set byk. You would like to eventually end up with all numbers equal to0. Is it possible?A set of2points is considered evenly spaced if they are diametrically opposed, and a set of3or more points is considered evenly spaced if they form a regular polygon.InputThe first line of input contains an integern(3 ≤n≤ 100000), the number of points along the circle.The following line contains a stringswith exactlyndigits, indicating the numbers initially present at each of the points, in clockwise order.OutputPrint \"YES\" (without quotes) if there is some sequence of operations that results in all numbers being0, otherwise \"NO\" (without quotes).You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).ExamplesInput30000100000100000110000000001100OutputYESInput6314159OutputNONoteIf we label the points from1ton, then for the first test case we can setk= 1. Then we increase the numbers at points7and22by1, then decrease the numbers at points7,17, and27by1, then decrease the numbers at points4,10,16,22, and28by1.",
