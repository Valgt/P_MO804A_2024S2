    "statement": "D. Alarm Clocktime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEvery evening Vitalya setsnalarm clocks to wake up tomorrow. Every alarm clock rings during exactly one minute and is characterized by one integerai— number of minute after midnight in which it rings. Every alarm clock begins ringing at the beginning of the minute and rings during whole minute.Vitalya will definitely wake up if during somemconsecutive minutes at leastkalarm clocks will begin ringing. Pay attention that Vitalya considers only alarm clocks which begin ringing during given period of time. He doesn't consider alarm clocks which started ringing before given period of time and continues ringing during given period of time.Vitalya is so tired that he wants to sleep all day long and not to wake up. Find out minimal number of alarm clocks Vitalya should turn off to sleep all next day. Now all alarm clocks are turned on.InputFirst line contains three integersn,mandk(1 ≤k≤n≤ 2·105,1 ≤m≤ 106) — number of alarm clocks, and conditions of Vitalya's waking up.Second line contains sequence ofdistinctintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 106) in whichaiequals minute on whichi-th alarm clock will ring. Numbers are given in arbitrary order. Vitalya lives in a Berland in which day lasts for106minutes.OutputOutput minimal number of alarm clocks that Vitalya should turn off to sleep all next day long.ExamplesInput3 3 23 5 1Output1Input5 10 312 8 18 25 1Output0Input7 7 27 3 4 1 6 5 2Output6Input2 2 21 3Output0NoteIn first example Vitalya should turn off first alarm clock which rings at minute3.In second example Vitalya shouldn't turn off any alarm clock because there are no interval of10consequence minutes in which3alarm clocks will ring.In third example Vitalya should turn off any6alarm clocks.",
