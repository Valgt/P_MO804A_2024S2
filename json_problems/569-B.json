Inventorytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputCompanies always have a lot of equipment, furniture and other things. All of them should be tracked. To do this, there is an inventory number assigned with each item. It is much easier to create a database by using those numbers and keep the track of everything.During an audit, you were surprised to find out that the items are not numbered sequentially, and some items even share the same inventory number! There is an urgent need to fix it. You have chosen to make the numbers of the items sequential, starting with1. Changing a number is quite a time-consuming process, and you would like to make maximum use of the current numbering.You have been given information on current inventory numbers fornitems in the company. Renumber items so that their inventory numbers form apermutationof numbers from1tonby changing the number of as few items as possible. Let us remind you that a set ofnnumbers forms apermutationif all the numbers are in the range from1ton, and no two numbers are equal.InputThe first line contains a single integern— the number of items (1 ≤n≤ 105).The second line containsnnumbersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 105) — the initial inventory numbers of the items.OutputPrintnnumbers — the final inventory numbers of the items in the order they occur in the input. If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.ExamplesInput31 3 2Output1 3 2Input42 2 3 3Output2 1 3 4Input12Output1NoteIn the first test the numeration is already a permutation, so there is no need to change anything.In the second test there are two pairs of equal numbers, in each pair you need to replace one number.In the third test you need to replace2by1, as the numbering should start from one.",
