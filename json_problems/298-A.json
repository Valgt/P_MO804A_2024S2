The blocks are numbered from 1 tonfrom left to right. If one moves from thei-th block to the(i+ 1)-th block, he will leave a right footprint on thei-th block. Similarly, if one moves from thei-th block to the(i- 1)-th block, he will leave a left footprint on thei-th block. If there already is a footprint on thei-th block, the new footprint will cover the old one.At the beginning, there were no footprints. Then polar bear Alice starts from thes-th block, makes a sequence of moves and ends in thet-th block. It is known that Alice never moves outside of the road.You are given the description of Alice's footprints. Your task is to find a pair of possible values ofs,tby looking at the footprints.InputThe first line of the input contains integern(3 ≤n≤ 1000).The second line contains the description of the road — the string that consists ofncharacters. Each character will be either \".\" (a block without footprint), or \"L\" (a block with a left footprint), \"R\" (a block with a right footprint).It's guaranteed that the given string contains at least one character not equal to \".\". Also, the first and the last character will always be \".\". It's guaranteed that a solution exists.OutputPrint two space-separated integers — the values ofsandt. If there are several possible solutions you can print any of them.ExamplesInput9..RRLL...Output3 4Input11.RRRLLLLL..Output7 5NoteThe first test sample is the one in the picture.",
