You can move from interval(a,b)from our set to interval(c,d)from our set if and only ifc<a<dorc<b<d. Also there is a path from intervalI1from our set to intervalI2from our set if there is a sequence of successive moves starting fromI1so that we can reachI2.Your program should handle the queries of the following two types:\"1 x y\"(x<y)— add the new interval(x,y)to the set of intervals. The length of the new interval is guaranteed to be strictly greater than all the previous intervals.\"2 a b\"(a≠b)— answer the question: is there a path froma-th (one-based) added interval tob-th (one-based) added interval?Answer all the queries. Note, that initially you have an empty set of intervals.InputThe first line of the input contains integerndenoting the number of queries,(1 ≤n≤ 105). Each of the following lines contains a query as described above. All numbers in the input are integers and don't exceed109by their absolute value.It's guaranteed that all queries are correct.OutputFor each query of the second type print \"YES\" or \"NO\" on a separate line depending on the answer.ExamplesInput51 1 51 5 112 1 21 2 92 1 2OutputNOYES",
