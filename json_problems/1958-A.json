She has an infinite amount of coins of all three types. However, she doesn't like to pay using coins worth $$$1$$$ burle — she thinks they are the most convenient to use.Help Eva to calculate the minimum number of coins worth $$$1$$$ burle she has to use, if she has to pay exactly $$$n$$$ burles. Note that she can spend any number of coins worth $$$3$$$ and/or $$$5$$$ burles.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line, containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of $$$1$$$-burle coins Eva has to use.ExampleInput57842211Output1 0 0 2 0NoteIn the first test case, Eva should use $$$1$$$ coin worth $$$1$$$ burle, and $$$2$$$ coins worth $$$3$$$ burles.In the second test case, Eva should use $$$1$$$ coin worth $$$3$$$ burles and $$$1$$$ coin worth $$$5$$$ burles.In the third test case, Eva should use $$$14$$$ coins worth $$$3$$$ burles.In the fourth test case, Eva should use $$$2$$$ coins worth $$$1$$$ burle.In the fifth test case, Eva should use $$$2$$$ coins worth $$$3$$$ burles and $$$1$$$ coin worth $$$5$$$ burles.",
