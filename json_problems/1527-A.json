And Then There Were Ktime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven an integer $$$n$$$, find the maximum value of integer $$$k$$$ such that the following condition holds:$$$n$$$ & ($$$n-1$$$) & ($$$n-2$$$) & ($$$n-3$$$) & ... ($$$k$$$) = $$$0$$$where & denotes thebitwise AND operation.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$).
