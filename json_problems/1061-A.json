Coinstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have unlimited number of coins with values $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, n$$$. You want to select some set of coins having the total value of $$$S$$$.It is allowed to have multiple coins with the same value in the set. What is the minimum number of coins required to get sum $$$S$$$?InputThe only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$S$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\\\le S \\\\le 10^9$$$)OutputPrint exactly one integer — the minimum number of coins required to obtain sum $$$S$$$.ExamplesInput5 11Output3Input6 16Output3NoteIn the first example, some of the possible ways to get sum $$$11$$$ with $$$3$$$ coins are:$$$(3, 4, 4)$$$$$$(2, 4, 5)$$$$$$(1, 5, 5)$$$$$$(3, 3, 5)$$$It is impossible to get sum $$$11$$$ with less than $$$3$$$ coins.In the second example, some of the possible ways to get sum $$$16$$$ with $$$3$$$ coins are:$$$(5, 5, 6)$$$$$$(4, 6, 6)$$$It is impossible to get sum $$$16$$$ with less than $$$3$$$ coins.",
