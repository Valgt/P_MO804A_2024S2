Lunar New Year and Number Divisiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLunar New Year is approaching, and Bob is struggling with his homework â€“ a number division problem.There are $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ on Bob's homework paper, where $$$n$$$ is always anevennumber. Bob is asked to divide those numbers into groups, where each group must contain at least $$$2$$$ numbers. Suppose the numbers are divided into $$$m$$$ groups, and the sum of the numbers in the $$$j$$$-th group is $$$s_j$$$. Bob's aim is to minimize the sum of the square of $$$s_j$$$, that is $$$$$$\\\\sum_{j = 1}^{m} s_j^2.$$$$$$Bob is puzzled by this hard problem. Could you please help him solve it?InputThe first line contains aneveninteger $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$), denoting that there are $$$n$$$ integers on Bob's homework paper.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^4$$$), describing the numbers you need to deal with.OutputA single line containing one integer, denoting the minimum of the sum of the square of $$$s_j$$$, which is $$$$$$\\\\sum_{i = j}^{m} s_j^2,$$$$$$ where $$$m$$$ is the number of groups.ExamplesInput4 8 5 2 3Output164Input6 1 1 1 2 2 2Output27NoteIn the first sample, one of the optimal solutions is to divide those $$$4$$$ numbers into $$$2$$$ groups $$$\\\\{2, 8\\\\}, \\\\{5, 3\\\\}$$$. Thus the answer is $$$(2 + 8)^2 + (5 + 3)^2 = 164$$$.In the second sample, one of the optimal solutions is to divide those $$$6$$$ numbers into $$$3$$$ groups $$$\\\\{1, 2\\\\}, \\\\{1, 2\\\\}, \\\\{1, 2\\\\}$$$. Thus the answer is $$$(1 + 2)^2 + (1 + 2)^2 + (1 + 2)^2 = 27$$$.",
