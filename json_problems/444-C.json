DZY Loves Colorstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutDZY loves colors, and he enjoys painting.On a colorful day, DZY gets a colorful ribbon, which consists ofnunits (they are numbered from1tonfrom left to right). The color of thei-th unit of the ribbon isiat first. It is colorful enough, but we still consider that the colorfulness of each unit is0at first.DZY loves painting, we know. He takes up a paintbrush with colorxand uses it to draw a line on the ribbon. In such a case some contiguous units are painted. Imagine that the color of uniticurrently isy. When it is painted by this paintbrush, the color of the unit becomesx, and the colorfulness of the unit increases by|x-y|.DZY wants to performmoperations, each operation can be one of the following:Paint all the units with numbers betweenlandr(both inclusive) with colorx.Ask the sum of colorfulness of the units betweenlandr(both inclusive).Can you help DZY?InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersn,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 105).Each of the nextmlines begins with a integertype(1 ≤type≤ 2), which represents the type of this operation.Iftype= 1, there will be3more integersl,r,x(1 ≤l≤r≤n; 1 ≤x≤ 108)in this line, describing an operation1.Iftype= 2, there will be2more integersl,r(1 ≤l≤r≤n)in this line, describing an operation2.OutputFor each operation2, print a line containing the answer — sum of colorfulness.ExamplesInput3 31 1 2 41 2 3 52 1 3Output8Input3 41 1 3 42 1 12 2 22 3 3Output321Input10 61 1 5 31 2 7 91 10 10 111 3 8 121 1 10 32 1 10Output129NoteIn the first sample, the color of each unit is initially[1, 2, 3], and the colorfulness is[0, 0, 0].After the first operation, colors become[4, 4, 3], colorfulness become[3, 2, 0].After the second operation, colors become[4, 5, 5], colorfulness become[3, 3, 2].So the answer to the only operation of type2is8.",
