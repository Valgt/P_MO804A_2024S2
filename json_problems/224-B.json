Your task is to find a minimal by inclusion segment[l,r](1 ≤l≤r≤n)such, that among numbersal,al+ 1,  ...,arthere are exactlykdistinct numbers.Segment[l,r](1 ≤l≤r≤n;l,rare integers) of lengthm=r-l+ 1, satisfying the given property, is calledminimal by inclusion, if there is no segment[x,y]satisfying the property and less thenmin length, such that1 ≤l≤x≤y≤r≤n. Note that the segment[l,r]doesn't have to be minimal in length among all segments, satisfying the given property.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers:nandk(1 ≤n,k≤ 105).
