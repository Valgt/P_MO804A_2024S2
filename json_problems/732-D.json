    "statement": "D. Examstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasiliy has an exam period which will continue forndays. He has to pass exams onmsubjects. Subjects are numbered from 1 tom.About every day we know exam for which one ofmsubjects can be passed on that day. Perhaps, some day you can't pass any exam. It is not allowed to pass more than one exam on any day.On each day Vasiliy can either pass the exam of that day (it takes the whole day) or prepare all day for some exam or have a rest.About each subject Vasiliy know a numberai— the number of days he should prepare to pass the exam numberi. Vasiliy can switch subjects while preparing for exams, it is not necessary to prepare continuously duringaidays for the exam numberi. He can mix the order of preparation for exams in any way.Your task is to determine the minimum number of days in which Vasiliy can pass all exams, or determine that it is impossible. Each exam should be passed exactly one time.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 105) — the number of days in the exam period and the number of subjects.The second line containsnintegersd1,d2, ...,dn(0 ≤di≤m), wherediis the number of subject, the exam of which can be passed on the day numberi. Ifdiequals 0, it is not allowed to pass any exams on the day numberi.The third line containsmpositive integersa1,a2, ...,am(1 ≤ai≤ 105), whereaiis the number of days that are needed to prepare before passing the exam on the subjecti.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum number of days in which Vasiliy can pass all exams. If it is impossible, print-1.ExamplesInput7 20 1 0 2 1 0 22 1Output5Input10 30 0 1 2 3 0 2 0 1 21 1 4Output9Input5 11 1 1 1 15Output-1NoteIn the first example Vasiliy can behave as follows. On the first and the second day he can prepare for the exam number 1 and pass it on the fifth day, prepare for the exam number 2 on the third day and pass it on the fourth day.In the second example Vasiliy should prepare for the exam number 3 during the first four days and pass it on the fifth day. Then on the sixth day he should prepare for the exam number 2 and then pass it on the seventh day. After that he needs to prepare for the exam number 1 on the eighth day and pass it on the ninth day.In the third example Vasiliy can't pass the only exam because he hasn't anough time to prepare for it.",
