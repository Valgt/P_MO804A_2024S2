They start with a sequence, initially containing just the number 0, and performnoperations. Each operation is one of the following:Add the integerxito the firstaielements of the sequence.Append an integerkito the end of the sequence. (And hence the size of the sequence increases by 1)Remove the last element of the sequence. So, the size of the sequence decreases by one. Note, that this operation can only be done if there are at least two elements in the sequence.After each operation, the cows would like to know the average of all the numbers in the sequence. Help them!InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 2·105)— the number of operations. The nextnlines describe the operations. Each line will start with an integerti(1 ≤ti≤ 3), denoting the type of the operation (see above). Ifti= 1, it will be followed by two integersai,xi(|xi| ≤ 103; 1 ≤ai). Ifti= 2, it will be followed by a single integerki(|ki| ≤ 103). Ifti= 3, it will not be followed by anything.It is guaranteed that all operations are correct (don't touch nonexistent elements) and that there will always be at least one element in the sequence.OutputOutputnlines each containing the average of the numbers in the sequence after the corresponding operation.The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed10- 6.ExamplesInput52 132 32 13Output0.5000000.0000001.5000001.3333331.500000Input62 11 2 202 21 2 -333Output0.50000020.50000014.33333312.33333317.50000017.000000NoteIn the second sample, the sequence becomes",
