GCD Arraystime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputConsider the array $$$a$$$ composed of all the integers in the range $$$[l, r]$$$. For example, if $$$l = 3$$$ and $$$r = 7$$$, then $$$a = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$$$.Given $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$k$$$, is it possible for $$$\\\\gcd(a)$$$ to be greater than $$$1$$$ after doing the following operation at most $$$k$$$ times?Choose $$$2$$$ numbers from $$$a$$$.Permanently remove one occurrence of each of them from the array.Insert their product back into $$$a$$$.$$$\\\\gcd(b)$$$ denotes thegreatest common divisor (GCD)of the integers in $$$b$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The input for each test case consists of a single line containing $$$3$$$ non-negative integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq 10^9, \\\\enspace 0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq r - l$$$).OutputFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to have the GCD of the corresponding array greater than $$$1$$$ by performing at most $$$k$$$ operations, and \"NO\" otherwise (case insensitive).ExampleInput91 1 03 5 113 13 04 4 03 7 44 10 32 4 01 7 31 5 3OutputNO NO YES YES YES YES NO NO YESNoteFor the first test case, $$$a = [1]$$$, so the answer is \"NO\", since the only element in the array is $$$1$$$.For the second test case the array is $$$a = [3, 4, 5]$$$ and we have $$$1$$$ operation. After the first operation the array can change to: $$$[3, 20]$$$, $$$[4, 15]$$$ or $$$[5, 12]$$$ all of which having their greatest common divisor equal to $$$1$$$ so the answer is \"NO\".For the third test case, $$$a = [13]$$$, so the answer is \"YES\", since the only element in the array is $$$13$$$.For the fourth test case, $$$a = [4]$$$, so the answer is \"YES\", since the only element in the array is $$$4$$$.",
