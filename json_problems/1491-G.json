    "statement": "G. Switch and Fliptime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ coins labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Initially, coin $$$c_i$$$ is on position $$$i$$$ and is facing upwards (($$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_n)$$$ is a permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$). You can do some operations on these coins.In one operation, you can do the following:Choose $$$2$$$ distinct indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$.Then, swap the coins on positions $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$.Then, flip both coins on positions $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$. (If they are initially faced up, they will be faced down after the operation and vice versa)Construct a sequence of at most $$$n+1$$$ operations such that after performing all these operations the coin $$$i$$$ will be on position $$$i$$$ at the end,facing up.Note that youdo not needto minimize the number of operations.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of coins.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1,c_2,\\\\dots,c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$c_i \\\\neq c_j$$$ for $$$i\\\\neq j$$$).OutputIn the first line, output an integer $$$q$$$ $$$(0 \\\\leq q \\\\leq n+1)$$$ — the number of operations you used.In the following $$$q$$$ lines, output two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq i, j \\\\leq n, i \\\\ne j)$$$ — the positions you chose for the current operation.ExamplesInput3 2 1 3Output3 1 3 3 2 3 1Input5 1 2 3 4 5Output0NoteLet coin $$$i$$$ facing upwards be denoted as $$$i$$$ and coin $$$i$$$ facing downwards be denoted as $$$-i$$$.The series of moves performed in the first sample changes the coins as such:$$$[~~~2,~~~1,~~~3]$$$$$$[-3,~~~1,-2]$$$$$$[-3,~~~2,-1]$$$$$$[~~~1,~~~2,~~~3]$$$In the second sample, the coins are already in their correct positions so there is no need to swap.",
