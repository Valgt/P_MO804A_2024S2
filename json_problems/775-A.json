University Scheduletime limit per test10 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn this problem your task is to come up with a week schedule of classes in university for professors and student groups. Consider that there are6educational days in week and maximum number of classes per educational day is7(classes numerated from1to7for each educational day).It is known that in universitynstudents study,mprofessors work and there areaclassrooms for conducting classes. Also you have two-dimensional array withn×msize which contains the following information. The number which stays ini-th row andj-th column equals to the number of classes which professorjmust conduct with the groupiin a single week. The schedule which you output must satisfy to array described above.There are several other conditions for schedule. Single professor can not conduct more than one class. Similarly, single student group can not be on more than one class at the same time.Let define afatiguefunction for professors and student groups. Call this functionf.To single professorfatiguecalculated in the following way. Let look on classes which this professor must conduct in each of the6-th educational days. Letxbe the number of class which professor will firstly conduct in dayiand lety— the last class for this professor. Then the value(2 +y-x+ 1)·(2 +y-x+ 1)must be added to professor'sfatigue. If professor has no classes in dayi, nothing is added to professor'sfatigue.For single student groupfatigueis calculated similarly. Lets look at classes of this group in each of the6educational days. Letxbe the number of first class for this group on dayiand lety— the last class for this group. Then the value(2 +y-x+ 1)·(2 +y-x+ 1)must be added to this group'sfatigue. If student group has no classes in dayi, nothing is added to group'sfatigue.So the value of functionfequals to total {fatigue} for allnstudent groups and for allmprofessors.Your task is to come up with such a schedule which minimizes the value of functionf.Jury prepared some solution of this problem. For each test you will get a certain number of points. It equals to result of division of the value of functionffrom the jury solution by the value of functionffor schedule which your program output (i. e. the smaller value of {fatigue} function your program find the more points you will get), multiplied by100. In the other words if the value offfor jury solution equals topand for your solution — toq, you will get100·p/qpoints (note, that the number of points is a real number). The points will be added together for all tests. The goal is to score as many points as possible.InputThe first line contains three integersn,manda(1 ≤n,m,a≤ 60) — the number of groups, the number of professors and the number of classrooms.Each of the followingnlines containsmintegers from0to24—j-th number ini-th line equals to the number of classes with the professorjmust conduct with thei-th student group.It is guaranteed that the number of classes in week for each professor and for each student group does not exceed24. Also guaranteed that the total number of classes in week does not exceed75% from a maximum number of classes which can be conducted based on the number of classrooms. For all tests there is at least one schedule satisfying all described conditions.OutputIn the first line print the minimized value of functionf.After that print blank line.After that print the schedule for each student group in increasing order of group number. For each student group print7lines. Each line must contains6numbers. Let the number ati-th line andj-th column equals tox. If inj-th day current group has no class numberi,xmust be equals to zero. Otherwisexmust be equals to the number of professor who will conduct the corresponding class with the corresponding student group.The number of classes which will be conducted simultaneously must not exceeds the number of classroomsa.Separate the description of the schedules for groups with a blank line.ExamplesInput3 3 11 0 00 1 00 0 1Output541 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 02 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 03 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0Input3 1 1111Output521 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 01 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 01 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0Input5 7 101 3 6 0 1 2 40 3 0 6 5 1 43 5 1 2 3 2 42 3 1 1 4 1 22 4 3 2 4 3 2Output15120 0 6 0 0 20 7 6 3 3 73 1 2 3 2 73 7 0 0 0 05 3 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 4 0 7 64 5 7 4 5 57 2 4 4 5 57 2 0 4 0 00 2 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 04 0 7 2 5 75 0 2 5 7 12 4 1 2 7 12 3 0 0 0 00 6 0 0 0 00 6 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 5 3 50 2 4 7 2 60 5 7 0 0 01 5 1 0 0 02 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 5 7 2 30 1 3 2 6 35 7 6 5 6 45 4 2 2 0 01 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0NoteDuring the main part of the competition (one week) you solution will be judged on100preliminary tests.
