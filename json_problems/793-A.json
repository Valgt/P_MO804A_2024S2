    "statement": "A. Oleg and sharestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOleg the bank client checks share prices every day. There arenshare prices he is interested in. Today he observed that each second exactly one of these prices decreases bykrubles (note that each second exactly one price changes, but at different seconds different prices can change). Prices can become negative. Oleg found this process interesting, and he asked Igor the financial analyst, what is the minimum time needed for allnprices to become equal, or it is impossible at all? Igor is busy right now, so he asked you to help Oleg. Can you answer this question?InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 105, 1 ≤k≤ 109) — the number of share prices, and the amount of rubles some price decreases each second.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — the initial prices.OutputPrint the only line containing the minimum number of seconds needed for prices to become equal, of «-1» if it is impossible.ExamplesInput3 312 9 15Output3Input2 210 9Output-1Input4 11 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000Output2999999997NoteConsider the first example.Suppose the third price decreases in the first second and become equal12rubles, then the first price decreases and becomes equal9rubles, and in the third second the third price decreases again and becomes equal9rubles. In this case all prices become equal9rubles in3seconds.There could be other possibilities, but this minimizes the time needed for all prices to become equal. Thus the answer is3.In the second example we can notice that parity of first and second price is different and never changes within described process. Thus prices never can become equal.In the third example following scenario can take place: firstly, the second price drops, then the third price, and then fourth price. It happens999999999times, and, since in one second only one price can drop, the whole process takes999999999 * 3 = 2999999997seconds. We can note that this is the minimum possible time.",
