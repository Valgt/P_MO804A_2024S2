    "statement": "A. Square and Rectanglestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYou are givennrectangles. The corners of rectangles have integer coordinates and their edges are parallel to theOxandOyaxes. The rectangles may touch each other, but they do not overlap (that is, there are no points that belong to the interior of more than one rectangle).Your task is to determine if the rectangles form a square. In other words, determine if the set of points inside or on the border of at least one rectangle is precisely equal to the set of points inside or on the border of some square.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 5). Nextnlines contain four integers each, describing a single rectangle:x1,y1,x2,y2(0 ≤x1<x2≤ 31400, 0 ≤y1<y2≤ 31400) —x1andx2arex-coordinates of the left and right edges of the rectangle, andy1andy2arey-coordinates of the bottom and top edges of the rectangle.No two rectangles overlap (that is, there are no points that belong to the interior of more than one rectangle).OutputIn a single line print \"YES\", if the given rectangles form a square, or \"NO\" otherwise.ExamplesInput50 0 2 30 3 3 52 0 5 23 2 5 52 2 3 3OutputYESInput40 0 2 30 3 3 52 0 5 23 2 5 5OutputNO",
