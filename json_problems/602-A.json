Two Basestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAfter seeing the \"ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US\" meme for the first time, numbersXandYrealised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.You're given a numberXrepresented in basebxand a numberYrepresented in baseby. Compare those two numbers.InputThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integersnandbx(1 ≤n≤ 10,2 ≤bx≤ 40), wherenis the number of digits in thebx-based representation ofX.The second line containsnspace-separated integersx1,x2, ...,xn(0 ≤xi<bx) — the digits ofX. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.The following two lines describeYin the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integersmandby(1 ≤m≤ 10,2 ≤by≤ 40,bx≠by), wheremis the number of digits in theby-based representation ofY, and the fourth line containsmspace-separated integersy1,y2, ...,ym(0 ≤yi<by) — the digits ofY.There will be no leading zeroes. BothXandYwill be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.OutputOutput a single character (quotes for clarity):'<' ifX<Y'>' ifX>Y'=' ifX=YExamplesInput6 21 0 1 1 1 12 104 7Output=Input3 31 0 22 52 4Output<Input7 1615 15 4 0 0 7 107 94 8 0 3 1 5 0Output>NoteIn the first sample,X= 1011112= 4710=Y.In the second sample,X= 1023= 215andY= 245= 1123, thusX<Y.In the third sample,andY= 48031509. We may notice thatXstarts with much larger digits andbxis much larger thanby, soXis clearly larger thanY.",
