Tokitsukaze and Strange Inequalitytime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTokitsukaze has a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Recall that a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is a sequence $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers, each of which from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq p_i \\\\leq n$$$).She wants to know how many different indices tuples $$$[a,b,c,d]$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a < b < c < d \\\\leq n$$$) in this permutation satisfy the following two inequalities:$$$p_a < p_c$$$ and $$$p_b > p_d$$$.Note that two tuples $$$[a_1,b_1,c_1,d_1]$$$ and $$$[a_2,b_2,c_2,d_2]$$$ are considered to be different if $$$a_1 \\\\ne a_2$$$ or $$$b_1 \\\\ne b_2$$$ or $$$c_1 \\\\ne c_2$$$ or $$$d_1 \\\\ne d_2$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 5000$$$) — the length of permutation $$$p$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq p_i \\\\leq n$$$) — the permutation $$$p$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the number of different $$$[a,b,c,d]$$$ tuples.ExampleInput365 3 6 1 4 241 2 3 4105 1 6 2 8 3 4 10 9 7Output3 0 28NoteIn the first test case, there are $$$3$$$ different $$$[a,b,c,d]$$$ tuples.$$$p_1 = 5$$$, $$$p_2 = 3$$$, $$$p_3 = 6$$$, $$$p_4 = 1$$$, where $$$p_1 < p_3$$$ and $$$p_2 > p_4$$$ satisfies the inequality, so one of $$$[a,b,c,d]$$$ tuples is $$$[1,2,3,4]$$$.Similarly, other two tuples are $$$[1,2,3,6]$$$, $$$[2,3,5,6]$$$.",
