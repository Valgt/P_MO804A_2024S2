Multithreadingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutEmuskald is addicted to Codeforces, and keeps refreshing the main page not to miss any changes in the \"recent actions\" list. He likes to read thread conversations where each thread consists of multiple messages.Recent actions shows a list ofndifferent threads ordered by the time of the latest message in the thread. When a new message is posted in a thread that thread jumps on the top of the list. No two messages of different threads are ever posted at the same time.Emuskald has just finished reading all his opened threads and refreshes the main page for some more messages to feed his addiction. He notices that no new threads have appeared in the list and at thei-th place in the list there is a thread that was at theai-th place before the refresh. He doesn't want to waste any time reading old messages so he wants to open only threads with new messages.Help Emuskald find out the number of threads thatsurelyhave new messages. A threadxsurely has a new message if there is no such sequence of thread updates (posting messages) that both conditions hold:threadxis not updated (it has no new messages);the list order 1, 2, ...,nchanges toa1,a2, ...,an.InputThe first line of input contains an integern, the number of threads (1 ≤n≤ 105). The next line contains a list ofnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,anwhereai(1 ≤ai≤n) is the old position of thei-th thread in the new list. It is guaranteed that all of theaiare distinct.OutputOutput a single integer — the number of threads that surely contain a new message.ExamplesInput55 2 1 3 4Output2Input31 2 3Output0Input44 3 2 1Output3NoteIn the first test case, threads 2 and 5 are placed before the thread 1, so these threads must contain new messages. Threads 1, 3 and 4 may contain no new messages, if only threads 2 and 5 have new messages.In the second test case, there may be no new messages at all, since the thread order hasn't changed.In the third test case, only thread 1 can contain no new messages.",
