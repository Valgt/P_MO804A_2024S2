    "statement": "B. Little Artem and Matrixtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLittle Artem likes electronics. He can spend lots of time making different schemas and looking for novelties in the nearest electronics store. The new control element was delivered to the store recently and Artem immediately bought it.That element can store information about the matrix of integers sizen×m. There aren+minputs in that element, i.e. each row and each column can get the signal. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some row, this row cyclically shifts to the left, that is the first element of the row becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some column, that column shifts cyclically to the top, that is first element of the column becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. Rows are numbered with integers from1tonfrom top to bottom, while columns are numbered with integers from1tomfrom left to right.Artem wants to carefully study this element before using it. For that purpose he is going to set up an experiment consisting ofqturns. On each turn he either sends the signal to some input or checks what number is stored at some position of the matrix.Artem has completed his experiment and has written down the results, but he has lost the chip! Help Artem find any initial matrix that will match the experiment results. It is guaranteed that experiment data is consistent, which means at least one valid matrix exists.InputThe first line of the input contains three integersn,mandq(1 ≤n,m≤ 100, 1 ≤q≤ 10 000) — dimensions of the matrix and the number of turns in the experiment, respectively.Nextqlines contain turns descriptions, one per line. Each description starts with an integerti(1 ≤ti≤ 3) that defines the type of the operation. For the operation of first and second type integerri(1 ≤ri≤n) orci(1 ≤ci≤m) follows, while for the operations of the third type three integersri,ciandxi(1 ≤ri≤n,1 ≤ci≤m,- 109≤xi≤ 109) are given.Operation of the first type (ti= 1) means that signal comes to the input corresponding to rowri, that is it will shift cyclically. Operation of the second type (ti= 2) means that columnciwill shift cyclically. Finally, operation of the third type means that at this moment of time cell located in the rowriand columncistores valuexi.OutputPrint the description of any valid initial matrix asnlines containingmintegers each. All output integers should not exceed109by their absolute value.If there are multiple valid solutions, output any of them.ExamplesInput2 2 62 12 23 1 1 13 2 2 23 1 2 83 2 1 8Output8 21 8Input3 3 21 23 2 2 5Output0 0 00 0 50 0 0",
