The Art of Dealing with ATMtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputATMs of a well-known bank of a small country are arranged so that they can not give any amount of money requested by the user. Due to the limited size of the bill dispenser (the device that is directly giving money from an ATM) and some peculiarities of the ATM structure, you can get at mostkbills from it, and the bills may be of at most two distinct denominations.For example, if a country uses bills with denominations10,50,100,500,1000and5000burles, then atk= 20such ATM can give sums100 000burles and96 000burles, but it cannot give sums99 000and101 000burles.Let's suppose that the country uses bills ofndistinct denominations, and the ATM that you are using has an unlimited number of bills of each type. You know that during the day you will need to withdraw a certain amount of cashqtimes. You know that when the ATM has multiple ways to give money, it chooses the one which requires the minimum number of bills, or displays an error message if it cannot be done. Determine the result of each of theqof requests for cash withdrawal.InputThe first line contains two integersn,k(1 ≤n≤ 5000,1 ≤k≤ 20).The next line containsnspace-separated integersai(1 ≤ai≤ 107) — the denominations of the bills that are used in the country. Numbersaifollow in the strictly increasing order.The next line contains integerq(1 ≤q≤ 20) — the number of requests for cash withdrawal that you will make.The nextqlines contain numbersxi(1 ≤xi≤ 2·108) — the sums of money in burles that you are going to withdraw from the ATM.OutputFor each request for cash withdrawal print on a single line the minimum number of bills it can be done, or print- 1, if it is impossible to get the corresponding sum.ExamplesInput6 2010 50 100 500 1000 5000842001000009500096000990001010020159950Output6201920-13-1-1Input5 21 2 3 5 8813579111315Output1112222-1",
