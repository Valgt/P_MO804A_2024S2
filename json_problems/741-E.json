Arpa’s abnormal DNA and Mehrdad’s deep interesttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAll of us know that girls in Arpa’s land are... ok, you’ve got the idea :DAnyone knows that Arpa isn't a normal man, he is ... well, sorry, I can't explain it more. Mehrdad is interested about the reason, so he asked Sipa, one of the best biology scientists in Arpa's land, for help. Sipa has a DNA editor.Sipa put Arpa under the DNA editor. DNA editor showed Arpa's DNA as a stringSconsisting ofnlowercase English letters. Also Sipa has another DNATconsisting of lowercase English letters that belongs to a normal man.Now there are(n+ 1)options to change Arpa's DNA, numbered from0ton.i-th of them is to putTbetweeni-th and(i+ 1)-th characters ofS(0 ≤i≤n). Ifi= 0,Twill be put beforeS, and ifi=n, it will be put afterS.Mehrdad wants to choose the mostinterestingoption for Arpa's DNA among thesen+ 1options. DNAAis moreinterestingthanBifAis lexicographically smaller thanB. Mehrdad asked Sipaqquestions:Given integersl,r,k,x,y, what is the most interesting option if we only consider such optionsithatl≤i≤rand? If there are several most interesting options, Mehrdad wants to know one with the smallest numberi.Since Sipa is a biology scientist but not a programmer, you should help him.InputThe first line contains stringsS,Tand integerq(1 ≤ |S|, |T|,q≤ 105) — Arpa's DNA, the DNA of a normal man, and the number of Mehrdad's questions. The stringsSandTconsist only of small English letters.Nextqlines describe the Mehrdad's questions. Each of these lines contain five integersl,r,k,x,y(0 ≤l≤r≤n,1 ≤k≤n,0 ≤x≤y<k).OutputPrintqintegers. Thej-th of them should be the numberiof the most interesting option among those that satisfy the conditions of thej-th question. If there is no optionisatisfying the conditions in some question, print-1.ExamplesInputabc d 40 3 2 0 00 3 1 0 01 2 1 0 00 1 3 2 2Output2 3 2 -1Inputabbbbbbaaa baababaaab 101 2 1 0 02 7 8 4 72 3 9 2 83 4 6 1 10 8 5 2 42 8 10 4 77 10 1 0 01 4 6 0 20 9 8 0 64 8 5 0 1Output1 4 2 -1 2 4 10 1 1 5NoteExplanation of first sample case:In the first question Sipa has two options:dabc(i= 0) andabdc(i= 2).
