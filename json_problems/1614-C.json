Divan and bitwise operationstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOnceDivananalyzed a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers as follows. He considered each non-emptysubsequenceof the sequence $$$a$$$, computed thebitwise XORof its elements and added up all the XORs, obtaining thecozinessof the sequence $$$a$$$.A sequence $$$c$$$ is asubsequenceof a sequence $$$d$$$ if $$$c$$$ can be obtained from $$$d$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. For example, $$$[1, \\\\, 2, \\\\, 3, \\\\, 4]$$$, $$$[2, \\\\, 4]$$$, and $$$[2]$$$ are subsequences of $$$[1, \\\\, 2, \\\\, 3, \\\\, 4]$$$, but $$$[4, \\\\, 3]$$$ and $$$[0]$$$ are not.Divanwas very proud of his analysis, but now he lost the sequence $$$a$$$, and also the coziness value! However,Divanremembers the value ofbitwise ORon $$$m$$$ contiguous subsegments of the sequence $$$a$$$. It turns out that each element of the original sequence is contained inat least oneof these $$$m$$$ segments.Divanasks you to help find the coziness of the sequence $$$a$$$ using the information he remembers. If several coziness values are possible, print any.As the result can be very large, print the value modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integer numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence and the number of contiguous segments whose bitwise OR valuesDivanremembers, respectively.The following $$$m$$$ lines describe the segments, one per line.Each segment is described with three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$, $$$0 \\\\le x \\\\le 2^{30} - 1$$$) — the first and last elements of the segment and the bitwise OR of $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\\\ldots, a_r$$$, respectively.It is guaranteed that each element of the sequence is contained in at least one of the segments. It is guaranteed that there exists a sequence that satisfies all constraints.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print the coziness any suitable sequence $$$a$$$ modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExampleInput3 2 1 1 2 2 3 2 1 3 5 2 3 5 5 4 1 2 7 3 3 7 4 4 0 4 5 2Output4 20 112NoteIn first example, one of the sequences that fits the constraints is $$$[0, 2]$$$. Consider all its non-empty subsequences:$$$[0]$$$: the bitwise XOR of this subsequence is $$$0$$$;$$$[2]$$$: the bitwise XOR of this subsequence is $$$2$$$;$$$[0, 2]$$$: the bitwise XOR of this subsequence is $$$2$$$.The sum of all results is $$$4$$$, so it is the answer.In second example, one of the sequences that fits the constraints is $$$[0, \\\\, 5, \\\\, 5]$$$.In third example, one of the sequences that fits the constraints is $$$[5, \\\\, 6, \\\\, 7, \\\\, 0, \\\\, 2]$$$.",
