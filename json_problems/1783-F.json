Double Sort IItime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two permutations $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of size $$$n$$$. A permutation of size $$$n$$$ is an array of $$$n$$$ elements, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. The elements in each permutation are indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.You can perform the following operation any number of times:choose an integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$;let $$$x$$$ be the integer such that $$$a_x = i$$$. Swap $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_x$$$;let $$$y$$$ be the integer such that $$$b_y = i$$$. Swap $$$b_i$$$ with $$$b_y$$$.Your goal is to make both permutationssorted in ascending order(i. e. the conditions $$$a_1 < a_2 < \\\\dots < a_n$$$ and $$$b_1 < b_2 < \\\\dots < b_n$$$ must be satisfied) usingminimum number of operations. Note that both permutations must be sorted after you perform the sequence of operations you have chosen.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 3000$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$; all $$$a_i$$$ are distinct).The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le n$$$; all $$$b_i$$$ are distinct).OutputFirst, print one integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le 2n$$$) — the minimum number of operations required to sort both permutations. Note that it can be shown that $$$2n$$$ operations are always enough.Then, print $$$k$$$ integers $$$op_1, op_2, \\\\dots, op_k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le op_j \\\\le n$$$), where $$$op_j$$$ is the value of $$$i$$$ you choose during the $$$j$$$-th operation.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput5 1 3 2 4 5 2 1 3 4 5Output1 2Input2 1 2 1 2Output0Input4 1 3 4 2 4 3 2 1Output2 3 4",
