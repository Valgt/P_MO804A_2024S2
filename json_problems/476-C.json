Can you compute it faster than Dreamoon?InputThe single line of the input contains two integersa,b(1 ≤a,b≤ 107).OutputPrint a single integer representing the answer modulo1 000 000 007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput1 1Output0Input2 2Output8NoteFor the first sample, there are no nice integers becauseis always zero.For the second sample, the set of nice integers is{3, 5}.",
