Irrational problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLittle Petya was given this problem for homework:You are given function(hererepresents the operation of taking the remainder). His task is to count the number of integersxin range[a;b]with propertyf(x) =x.It is a pity that Petya forgot the order in which the remainders should be taken and wrote down only 4 numbers. Each of 24 possible orders of taking the remainder has equal probability of being chosen. For example, if Petya has numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 then he can take remainders in that order or first take remainder modulo 4, then modulo 2, 3, 1. There also are 22 other permutations of these numbers that represent orders in which remainder can be taken. In this problem 4 numbers wrote down by Petya will be pairwise distinct.Now it is impossible for Petya to complete the task given by teacher but just for fun he decided to find the number of integerswith property that probability thatf(x) =xis not less than31.4159265352718281828459045%. In other words, Petya will pick up the numberxif there exist at least7permutations of numbersp1,p2,p3,p4, for whichf(x) =x.InputFirst line of the input will contain 6 integers, separated by spaces:p1,p2,p3,p4,a,b(1 ≤p1,p2,p3,p4≤ 1000, 0 ≤a≤b≤ 31415).It is guaranteed that numbersp1,p2,p3,p4will be pairwise distinct.OutputOutput the number of integers in the given range that have the given property.ExamplesInput2 7 1 8 2 8Output0Input20 30 40 50 0 100Output20Input31 41 59 26 17 43Output9",
