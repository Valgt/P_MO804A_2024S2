Just Arrange the Iconstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBerPhone X is almost ready for release with $$$n$$$ applications being preinstalled on the phone. Acategoryof an application characterizes a genre or a theme of this application (like \"game\", \"business\", or \"education\"). The categories are given as integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive; the $$$i$$$-th application has category $$$c_i$$$.You can choose $$$m$$$ — the number of screens and $$$s$$$ — the size of each screen. You need to fit all $$$n$$$ icons of the applications (one icon representing one application) meeting the following requirements:On each screen, all the icons must belong to applications of the same category (but different screens can contain icons of applications of the same category);Each screen must be either completely filled with icons (the number of icons on the screen is equal to $$$s$$$) or almost filled with icons (the number of icons is equal to $$$s-1$$$).Your task is to find the minimal possible number of screens $$$m$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^6$$$) — the number of the icons. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le n$$$), where $$$c_i$$$ is the category of the $$$i$$$-th application.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ for all test cases in the input does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^6$$$.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ integers — the answers to the given test cases in the order they follow in the input. The answer to a test case is an integer $$$m$$$ — the minimum number of screens on which all $$$n$$$ icons can be placed satisfying the given requirements.ExampleInput3 11 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 6 1 2 2 2 2 1 5 4 3 3 1 2Output3 3 4NoteIn the first test case of the example, all the icons can be placed on three screens of size $$$4$$$: a screen with $$$4$$$ icons of the category $$$1$$$, a screen with $$$3$$$ icons of the category $$$1$$$, and a screen with $$$4$$$ icons of the category $$$5$$$.",
