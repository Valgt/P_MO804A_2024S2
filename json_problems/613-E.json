In the last magazine Oleg found a curious puzzle, and the magazine promised a valuable prize for it's solution. We give a formal description of the problem below.The puzzle field consists of two rows, each row containsncells. Each cell contains exactly one small English letter. You also are given a wordw, which consists ofksmall English letters. Asolutionof the puzzle is a sequence of field cellsc1,...,ck, such that:For allifrom1tokthe letter written in the cellcimatches the letterwi;All the cells in the sequence are pairwise distinct;For allifrom1tok- 1cellsciandci+ 1have a common side.Oleg Petrov quickly found a solution for the puzzle. Now he wonders, how many distinct solutions are there for this puzzle. Oleg Petrov doesn't like too large numbers, so calculate the answer modulo109+ 7.Two solutionsciandc'iare considered distinct if the sequences of cells do not match in at least one position, that is there is suchjin range from1tok, such thatcj≠c'j.InputThe first two lines contain the state of the field for the puzzle. Each of these non-empty lines contains exactlynsmall English letters.The next line is left empty.The next line is non-empty and contains wordw, consisting of small English letters.The length of each line doesn't exceed2 000.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of distinct solutions for the puzzle modulo109+ 7.ExamplesInputcodeedoccodeOutput4InputaaaaaaaaOutput14",
