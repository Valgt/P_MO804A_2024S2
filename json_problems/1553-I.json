Stairstime limit per test10 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor a permutation $$$p$$$ of numbers $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$, we define astair array$$$a$$$ as follows: $$$a_i$$$ is length of the longest segment of permutation which contains position $$$i$$$ and is made of consecutive values in sorted order: $$$[x, x+1, \\\\ldots, y-1, y]$$$ or $$$[y, y-1, \\\\ldots, x+1, x]$$$ for some $$$x \\\\leq y$$$. For example, for permutation $$$p = [4, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 5]$$$ we have $$$a = [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$$$.You are given the stair array $$$a$$$. Your task is to calculate the number of permutations which have stair array equal to $$$a$$$. Since the number can be big, compute it modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$. Note that this number can be equal to zero.InputThe first line of input contains integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$)  — the length of a stair array $$$a$$$.The second line of input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$).OutputPrint the number of permutations which have stair array equal to $$$a$$$.
