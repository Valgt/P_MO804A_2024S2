However, she hasn't learned the concept of \"carrying\" fully — instead of carrying to thenextcolumn, she carries to the columntwo columns to the left.For example, theregularway to evaluate the sum $$$2039 + 2976$$$ would be as shown:However, Alice evaluates it as shown:In particular, this is what she does:add $$$9$$$ and $$$6$$$ to make $$$15$$$, and carry the $$$1$$$ to the columntwo columns to the left, i. e. to the column \"$$$0$$$ $$$9$$$\";add $$$3$$$ and $$$7$$$ to make $$$10$$$ and carry the $$$1$$$ to the columntwo columns to the left, i. e. to the column \"$$$2$$$ $$$2$$$\";add $$$1$$$, $$$0$$$, and $$$9$$$ to make $$$10$$$ and carry the $$$1$$$ to the columntwo columns to the left, i. e. to the column above the plus sign;add $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ to make $$$5$$$;add $$$1$$$ to make $$$1$$$.Thus, she ends up with the incorrect result of $$$15005$$$.Alice comes up to Bob and says that she has added two numbers to get a result of $$$n$$$. However, Bob knows that Alice adds in her own way. Help Bob find the number ofordered pairs of positive integerssuch that when Alice adds them, she will get a result of $$$n$$$. Note that pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ and $$$(b, a)$$$ are considered different if $$$a \\\\ne b$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the number Alice shows Bob.OutputFor each test case, output one integer — the number oforderedpairs ofpositive integerssuch that when Alice adds them, she will get a result of $$$n$$$.ExampleInput5 100 12 8 2021 10000Output9 4 7 44 99NoteIn the first test case, when Alice evaluates any of the sums $$$1 + 9$$$, $$$2 + 8$$$, $$$3 + 7$$$, $$$4 + 6$$$, $$$5 + 5$$$, $$$6 + 4$$$, $$$7 + 3$$$, $$$8 + 2$$$, or $$$9 + 1$$$, she will get a result of $$$100$$$.
