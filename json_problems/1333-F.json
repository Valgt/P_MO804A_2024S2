Kate and imperfectiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKate has a set $$$S$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers $$$\\\\{1, \\\\dots, n\\\\} $$$.She thinks thatimperfectionof a subset $$$M \\\\subseteq S$$$ is equal to themaximumof $$$gcd(a, b)$$$ over all pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ such that both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are in $$$M$$$ and $$$a \\\\neq b$$$.Kate is a very neat girl and for each $$$k \\\\in \\\\{2, \\\\dots, n\\\\}$$$ she wants to find a subset that has thesmallest imperfectionamong all subsets in $$$S$$$ of size $$$k$$$. There can be more than one subset with the smallest imperfection and the same size, but you don't need to worry about it. Kate wants to find all the subsets herself, but she needs your help to find the smallest possible imperfection for each size $$$k$$$, will name it $$$I_k$$$.Please, help Kate to find $$$I_2$$$, $$$I_3$$$, ..., $$$I_n$$$.InputThe first and only line in the input consists of only one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$)  — the size of the given set $$$S$$$.OutputOutput contains only one line that includes $$$n - 1$$$ integers: $$$I_2$$$, $$$I_3$$$, ..., $$$I_n$$$.ExamplesInput2Output1Input3Output1 1NoteFirst sample: answer is 1, because $$$gcd(1, 2) = 1$$$.Second sample: there are subsets of $$$S$$$ with sizes $$$2, 3$$$ with imperfection equal to 1.
