Obtain a Permutationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a rectangular matrix of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$ consisting of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.In one move, you can:chooseany elementof the matrix and change its value toanyinteger between $$$1$$$ and $$$n \\\\cdot m$$$, inclusive;takeany columnand shift it one cell up cyclically (see the example of such cyclic shift below).A cyclic shift is an operation such that you choose some $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le j \\\\le m$$$) and set $$$a_{1, j} := a_{2, j}, a_{2, j} := a_{3, j}, \\\\dots, a_{n, j} := a_{1, j}$$$simultaneously.Example of cyclic shift of the first columnYou want to perform the minimum number of moves to make this matrix look like this:In other words, the goal is to obtain the matrix, where $$$a_{1, 1} = 1, a_{1, 2} = 2, \\\\dots, a_{1, m} = m, a_{2, 1} = m + 1, a_{2, 2} = m + 2, \\\\dots, a_{n, m} = n \\\\cdot m$$$ (i.e. $$$a_{i, j} = (i - 1) \\\\cdot m + j$$$) with theminimum number of movesperformed.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5, n \\\\cdot m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the matrix.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ integers each. The number at the line $$$i$$$ and position $$$j$$$ is $$$a_{i, j}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_{i, j} \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputPrint one integer — the minimum number of moves required to obtain the matrix, where $$$a_{1, 1} = 1, a_{1, 2} = 2, \\\\dots, a_{1, m} = m, a_{2, 1} = m + 1, a_{2, 2} = m + 2, \\\\dots, a_{n, m} = n \\\\cdot m$$$ ($$$a_{i, j} = (i - 1)m + j$$$).ExamplesInput3 3 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6Output6Input4 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12Output0Input3 4 1 6 3 4 5 10 7 8 9 2 11 12Output2NoteIn the first example, you can set $$$a_{1, 1} := 7, a_{1, 2} := 8$$$ and $$$a_{1, 3} := 9$$$ then shift the first, the second and the third columns cyclically, so the answer is $$$6$$$. It can be shown that you cannot achieve a better answer.In the second example, the matrix is already good so the answer is $$$0$$$.In the third example, it is enough to shift the second column cyclically twice to obtain a good matrix, so the answer is $$$2$$$.",
