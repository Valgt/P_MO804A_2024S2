His class has been studying arithmetic expressions. On the last class the teacher wrote three positive integersa,b,con the blackboard. The task was to insert signs of operations '+' and '*', and probably brackets between the numbers so that the value of the resulting expression is as large as possible. Let's consider an example: assume that the teacher wrote numbers 1, 2 and 3 on the blackboard. Here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:1+2*3=71*(2+3)=51*2*3=6(1+2)*3=9Note that you can insert operation signs only betweenaandb, and betweenbandc, that is, you cannot swap integers. For instance, in the given sample you cannot get expression (1+3)*2.It's easy to see that the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.Your task is: givena,bandcprint the maximum value that you can get.InputThe input contains three integersa,bandc, each on a single line (1 ≤a,b,c≤ 10).OutputPrint the maximum value of the expression that you can obtain.ExamplesInput123Output9Input2103Output60",
