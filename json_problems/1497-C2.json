The only difference is that in this version $$$3 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$.You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Find $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k$$$, such that:$$$a_1 + a_2 + \\\\ldots + a_k = n$$$$$$LCM(a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k) \\\\le \\\\frac{n}{2}$$$Here $$$LCM$$$ is theleast common multipleof numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k$$$.We can show that for given constraints the answer always exists.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4)$$$  — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$3 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k$$$, for which all conditions are satisfied.ExampleInput2 6 4 9 5Output1 2 2 1  1 3 3 1 1",
