He thinks that any decent eight point set must consist of all pairwise intersections of three distinct integer vertical straight lines and three distinct integer horizontal straight lines, except for the average of these nine points. In other words, there must be three integersx1,x2,x3and three more integersy1,y2,y3, such thatx1<x2<x3,y1<y2<y3and the eight point set consists of all points(xi,yj)(1 ≤i,j≤ 3), except for point(x2,y2).You have a set of eight points. Find out if Gerald can use this set?InputThe input consists of eight lines, thei-th line contains two space-separated integersxiandyi(0 ≤xi,yi≤ 106). You do not have any other conditions for these points.OutputIn a single line print word \"respectable\", if the given set of points corresponds to Gerald's decency rules, and \"ugly\" otherwise.ExamplesInput0 00 10 21 01 22 02 12 2OutputrespectableInput0 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 0OutputuglyInput1 11 21 32 12 22 33 13 2Outputugly",
