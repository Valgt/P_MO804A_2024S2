Clock Conversiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour format.24-hour formatdivides the day into 24 hours from $$$00$$$ to $$$23$$$, each of which has 60 minutes from $$$00$$$ to $$$59$$$.12-hour formatdivides the day into two halves: the first half is $$$\\\\mathrm{AM}$$$, and the second half is $$$\\\\mathrm{PM}$$$. In each half, the hours are numbered in the order $$$12, 01, 02, 03, \\\\dots, 11$$$. Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from $$$00$$$ to $$$59$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1440$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$5$$$ with formathh:mmrepresenting a valid time in the 24-hour format.hhrepresents the hour from $$$00$$$ to $$$23$$$, andmmrepresents the minute from $$$00$$$ to $$$59$$$.The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.OutputFor each test case, output two strings separated by a space (\"hh:mm AM\" or \"hh:mm PM\"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test case (without quotes).You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not remove leading zeroes.ExampleInput1109:4118:0612:1400:5900:0014:3401:0119:0711:5912:0021:37Output09:41 AM 06:06 PM 12:14 PM 12:59 AM 12:00 AM 02:34 PM 01:01 AM 07:07 PM 11:59 AM 12:00 PM 09:37 PM",
