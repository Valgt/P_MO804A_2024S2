Mahmoud and Ehab and the even-odd gametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMahmoud and Ehab play a game called the even-odd game. Ehab chooses his favorite integernand then they take turns, starting from Mahmoud. In each player's turn, he has to choose an integeraand subtract it fromnsuch that:1 ≤a≤n.If it's Mahmoud's turn,ahas to be even, but if it's Ehab's turn,ahas to be odd.If the current player can't choose any number satisfying the conditions, he loses. Can you determine the winner if they both play optimally?InputThe only line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 109), the number at the beginning of the game.OutputOutput \"Mahmoud\" (without quotes) if Mahmoud wins and \"Ehab\" (without quotes) otherwise.ExamplesInput1OutputEhabInput2OutputMahmoudNoteIn the first sample, Mahmoud can't choose any integerainitially because there is no positive even integer less than or equal to1so Ehab wins.In the second sample, Mahmoud has to choosea= 2and subtract it fromn.
