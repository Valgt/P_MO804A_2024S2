Mike and Chocolate Thievestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBad news came to Mike's village, some thieves stole a bunch of chocolates from the local factory! Horrible!Aside from loving sweet things, thieves from this area are known to be very greedy. So after a thief takes his number of chocolates for himself, the next thief will take exactlyktimes more than the previous one. The value ofk(k> 1) is a secret integer known only to them. It is also known that each thief's bag can carry at mostnchocolates (if they intend to take more, the deal is cancelled) and that there wereexactly fourthieves involved.Sadly, only the thieves know the value ofn, but rumours say that the numbers of ways they could have taken the chocolates (for a fixedn, but not fixedk) ism. Two ways are considered different if one of the thieves (they should be numbered in the order they take chocolates) took different number of chocolates in them.Mike want to track the thieves down, so he wants to know what their bags are and value ofnwill help him in that. Please findthe smallest possiblevalue ofnor tell him that the rumors are false and there is no suchn.InputThe single line of input contains the integerm(1 ≤m≤ 1015)— the number of ways the thieves might steal the chocolates, as rumours say.OutputPrint the only integern— the maximum amount of chocolates that thieves' bags can carry. If there are more than onensatisfying the rumors,print the smallest one.If there is no suchnfor a false-rumouredm, print- 1.ExamplesInput1Output8Input8Output54Input10Output-1NoteIn the first sample case the smallestnthat leads to exactly one way of stealing chocolates isn= 8, whereas the amounts of stealed chocolates are(1, 2, 4, 8)(the number of chocolates stolen by each of the thieves).In the second sample case the smallestnthat leads to exactly8ways isn= 54with the possibilities:(1, 2, 4, 8),  (1, 3, 9, 27),  (2, 4, 8, 16),  (2, 6, 18, 54),  (3, 6, 12, 24),  (4, 8, 16, 32),  (5, 10, 20, 40),  (6, 12, 24, 48).There is nonleading to exactly10ways of stealing chocolates in the third sample case.",
