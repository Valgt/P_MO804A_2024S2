Hacker, pack your bags!time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt's well known that the best way to distract from something is to do one's favourite thing. Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactlyxdays. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out thatnvouchers left.i-th voucher is characterized by three integersli,ri,costi— day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of thei-th voucher is a valueri-li+ 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchersiandj(i≠j)so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations isexactlyxand their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchersiandjdon't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled:ri<ljorrj<li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!InputThe first line contains two integersnandx(2 ≤n,x≤ 2·105)— the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the nextnlines contains three integersli,riandcosti(1 ≤li≤ri≤ 2·105, 1 ≤costi≤ 109)— description of the voucher.OutputPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print- 1if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total durationexactlyx.ExamplesInput4 51 3 41 2 55 6 11 2 4Output5Input3 24 6 32 4 13 5 4Output-1NoteIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers.
