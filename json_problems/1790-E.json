Vlad and a Pair of Numberstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVlad found two positive numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$a,b>0$$$). He discovered that $$$a \\\\oplus b = \\\\frac{a + b}{2}$$$, where $$$\\\\oplus$$$ means thebitwise exclusive OR, and division is performed without rounding..Since it is easier to remember one number than two, Vlad remembered only $$$a\\\\oplus b$$$, let's denote this number as $$$x$$$. Help him find any suitable $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ or tell him that they do not exist.InputThe first line of the input data contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test.Each test case is described by a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le 2^{29}$$$) — the number that Vlad remembered.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As the answer, output $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$0 < a,b \\\\le 2^{32}$$$), such that $$$x = a \\\\oplus b = \\\\frac{a + b}{2}$$$. If there are several answers, output any of them. If there are no matching pairs, output-1.ExampleInput6251061836Output3 1 -1 13 7 -1 25 11 50 22",
