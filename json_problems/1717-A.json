    "statement": "A. Madoka and Strange Thoughtstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMadoka is a very strange girl, and therefore she suddenly wondered how many pairs of integers $$$(a, b)$$$ exist, where $$$1 \\\\leq a, b \\\\leq n$$$, for which $$$\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)}{\\\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)} \\\\leq 3$$$.In this problem, $$$\\\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)$$$ denotesthe greatest common divisorof the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and $$$\\\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)$$$ denotesthe smallest common multipleof the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first and the only line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^8$$$).OutputFor each test case output a single integer — the number of pairs of integers satisfying the condition.ExampleInput612345100000000Output1 4 7 10 11 266666666NoteFor $$$n = 1$$$ there is exactly one pair of numbers — $$$(1, 1)$$$ and it fits.For $$$n = 2$$$, there are only $$$4$$$ pairs — $$$(1, 1)$$$, $$$(1, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 1)$$$, $$$(2, 2)$$$ and they all fit.For $$$n = 3$$$, all $$$9$$$ pair are suitable, except $$$(2, 3)$$$ and $$$(3, 2)$$$, since their $$$\\\\operatorname{lcm}$$$ is $$$6$$$, and $$$\\\\operatorname{gcd}$$$ is $$$1$$$, which doesn't fit the condition.",
