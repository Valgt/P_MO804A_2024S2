Sequence Mastertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor some positive integer $$$m$$$, YunQian considers an array $$$q$$$ of $$$2m$$$ (possibly negative) integersgood, if and only if for every possible subsequence of $$$q$$$ that has length $$$m$$$, the product of the $$$m$$$ elements in the subsequence is equal to the sum of the $$$m$$$ elements that arenotin the subsequence. Formally, let $$$U=\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,2m\\\\}$$$. For all sets $$$S \\\\subseteq U$$$ such that $$$|S|=m$$$, $$$\\\\prod\\\\limits_{i \\\\in S} q_i = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i \\\\in U \\\\setminus S} q_i$$$.Define thedistancebetween two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ both of length $$$k$$$ to be $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^k|a_i-b_i|$$$.You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$ and an array $$$p$$$ of $$$2n$$$ integers.Find the minimum distance between $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ over all good arrays $$$q$$$ of length $$$2n$$$. It can be shown for all positive integers $$$n$$$, at least one good array exists. Note that you arenot requiredto construct the array $$$q$$$ that achieves this minimum distance.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_{2n}$$$ ($$$|p_i| \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum distance between $$$p$$$ and a good $$$q$$$.ExampleInput416 921 2 2 12-2 -2 2 24-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4Output3 2 5 13NoteIn the first test case, it is optimal to let $$$q=[6,6]$$$.In the second test case, it is optimal to let $$$q=[2,2,2,2]$$$.",
