Matrix Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a matrix $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ rows by $$$m$$$ columns. Each element of the matrix is equal to $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose an element of the matrix and replace it with either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.You are also given two arrays $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ (of length $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ respectively). After you perform the operations, the matrix should satisfy the following conditions:the number of ones in the $$$i$$$-th row of the matrix should be exactly $$$A_i$$$ for every $$$i \\\\in [1, n]$$$.the number of ones in the $$$j$$$-th column of the matrix should be exactly $$$B_j$$$ for every $$$j \\\\in [1, m]$$$.Calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 50$$$).Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\\\dots, a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_{i,j} \\\\le 1$$$).The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$A_1, A_2, \\\\dots, A_n$$$ ($$$0\\\\le A_i\\\\le m$$$).The next line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$B_1, B_2, \\\\dots, B_m$$$ ($$$0\\\\le B_i\\\\le n$$$).OutputPrint one integer â€” the minimum number of operations you have to perform, or-1if it is impossible.ExamplesInput3 30 0 00 0 00 0 01 1 11 1 1Output3Input3 31 1 11 1 11 1 13 2 11 2 3Output3Input2 20 00 01 20 1Output-1",
