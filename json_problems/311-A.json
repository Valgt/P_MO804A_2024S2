When trying to solve a problem called \"The Closest Pair Of Points In The Plane\", he found that a code which gave a wrong time complexity got Accepted instead of Time Limit Exceeded.The problem is the follows. Givennpoints in the plane, find a pair of points between which the distance is minimized. Distance between(x1,y1)and(x2,y2)is.The pseudo code of the unexpected code is as follows:input nfor i from 1 to ninput the i-th point's coordinates into p[i]sort array p[] by increasing of x coordinate first and increasing of y coordinate secondd=INF        //here INF is a number big enoughtot=0for i from 1 to nfor j from (i+1) to n++totif (p[j].x-p[i].x>=d) then break    //notice that \"break\" is only to be//out of the loop \"for j\"d=min(d,distance(p[i],p[j]))output dHere,totcan be regarded as the running time of the code. Due to the fact that a computer can only run a limited number of operations per second,totshould not be more thankin order not to get Time Limit Exceeded.You are a great hacker. Would you please help Tiny generate a test data and let the code get Time Limit Exceeded?InputA single line which contains two space-separated integersnandk(2 ≤n≤ 2000,1 ≤k≤ 109).OutputIf there doesn't exist such a data which let the given code get TLE, print \"no solution\" (without quotes); else printnlines, and thei-th line contains two integersxi,yi(|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109)representing the coordinates of thei-th point.The conditions below must be held:All the points must be distinct.|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109.After running the given code, the value oftotshould be larger thank.ExamplesInput4 3Output0 00 11 01 1Input2 100Outputno solution",
