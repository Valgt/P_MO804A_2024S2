She is responsible for creating a departure schedule. There arenflights that must depart today, thei-th of them is planned to depart at thei-th minute of the day.Metropolis airport is the main transport hub of Metropolia, so it is difficult to keep the schedule intact. This is exactly the case today: because of technical issues, no flights were able to depart during the firstkminutes of the day, so now the new departure schedule must be created.Allnscheduled flights must now depart at different minutes between(k+ 1)-th and(k+n)-th, inclusive. However, it's not mandatory for the flights to depart in the same order they were initially scheduled to do so — their order in the new schedule can be different. There is only one restriction: no flight is allowed to depart earlier than it was supposed to depart in the initial schedule.Helen knows that each minute of delay of thei-th flight costs airportciburles. Help her find the order for flights to depart in the new schedule that minimizes the total cost for the airport.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤k≤n≤ 300 000), herenis the number of flights, andkis the number of minutes in the beginning of the day that the flights did not depart.The second line containsnintegersc1,c2, ...,cn(1 ≤ci≤ 107), hereciis the cost of delaying thei-th flight for one minute.OutputThe first line must contain the minimum possible total cost of delaying the flights.The second line must containndifferent integerst1,t2, ...,tn(k+ 1 ≤ti≤k+n), heretiis the minute when thei-th flight must depart. If there are several optimal schedules, print any of them.ExampleInput5 24 2 1 10 2Output203 6 7 4 5NoteLet us consider sample test. If Helen just moves all flights2minutes later preserving the order, the total cost of delaying the flights would be(3 - 1)·4 + (4 - 2)·2 + (5 - 3)·1 + (6 - 4)·10 + (7 - 5)·2 = 38burles.However, the better schedule is shown in the sample answer, its cost is(3 - 1)·4 + (6 - 2)·2 + (7 - 3)·1 + (4 - 4)·10 + (5 - 5)·2 = 20burles.",
