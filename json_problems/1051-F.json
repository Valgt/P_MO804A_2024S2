The Shortest Statementtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a weighed undirectedconnectedgraph, consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges.You should answer $$$q$$$ queries, the $$$i$$$-th query is to find the shortest distance between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m~(1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 10^5, m - n \\\\le 20)$$$ — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.Next $$$m$$$ lines contain the edges: the $$$i$$$-th edge is a triple of integers $$$v_i, u_i, d_i~(1 \\\\le u_i, v_i \\\\le n, 1 \\\\le d_i \\\\le 10^9, u_i \\\\neq v_i)$$$. This triple means that there is an edge between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ of weight $$$d_i$$$. It is guaranteed that graph contains no self-loops and multiple edges.The next line contains a single integer $$$q~(1 \\\\le q \\\\le 10^5)$$$ — the number of queries.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i~(1 \\\\le u_i, v_i \\\\le n)$$$ — descriptions of the queries.Pay attention to the restriction $$$m - n ~ \\\\le ~ 20$$$.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines.The $$$i$$$-th line should contain the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query — the shortest distance between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.ExamplesInput3 31 2 32 3 13 1 531 21 32 3Output341Input8 131 2 42 3 63 4 14 5 125 6 36 7 87 8 71 4 11 8 32 6 92 7 14 6 36 8 281 51 72 32 83 73 46 87 8Output75677127",
