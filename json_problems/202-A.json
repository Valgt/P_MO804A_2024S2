Find its lexicographically largest palindromic subsequence.We'll call a non-empty strings[p1p2...pk]=sp1sp2...spk(1≤p1<p2< ... <pk≤|s|) asubsequenceof strings=s1s2...s|s|, where|s|is the length of strings. For example, strings \"abcb\", \"b\" and \"abacaba\" are subsequences of string \"abacaba\".Stringx=x1x2...x|x|islexicographically largerthan stringy=y1y2...y|y|if either|x|>|y|andx1=y1,x2=y2, ...,x|y|=y|y|, or there exists such numberr(r< |x|,r< |y|) thatx1=y1,x2=y2, ...,xr=yrandxr+  1>yr+  1. Characters in the strings are compared according to their ASCII codes. For example, string \"ranger\" is lexicographically larger than string \"racecar\" and string \"poster\" is lexicographically larger than string \"post\".Strings=s1s2...s|s|is apalindromeif it matches stringrev(s)=s|s|s|s| - 1...s1. In other words, a string is a palindrome if it reads the same way from left to right and from right to left. For example, palindromic strings are \"racecar\", \"refer\" and \"z\".InputThe only input line contains a non-empty stringsconsisting of lowercase English letters only. Its length does not exceed10.OutputPrint the lexicographically largest palindromic subsequence of strings.ExamplesInputradarOutputrrInputbowwowwowOutputwwwwwInputcodeforcesOutputsInputmississippOutputssssNoteAmong all distinct subsequences of string \"radar\" the following ones are palindromes: \"a\", \"d\", \"r\", \"aa\", \"rr\", \"ada\", \"rar\", \"rdr\", \"raar\" and \"radar\". The lexicographically largest of them is \"rr\".",
