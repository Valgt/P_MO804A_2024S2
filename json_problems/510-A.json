However, that turns out to be too hard for a beginner, so she decides to draw a snake instead.A snake is a pattern on anbymtable. Denotec-th cell ofr-th row as(r,c). The tail of the snake is located at(1, 1), then it's body extends to(1,m), then goes down2rows to(3,m), then goes left to(3, 1)and so on.Your task is to draw this snake for Fox Ciel: the empty cells should be represented as dot characters ('.') and the snake cells should be filled with number signs ('#').Consider sample tests in order to understand the snake pattern.InputThe only line contains two integers:nandm(3 ≤n,m≤ 50).nis anoddnumber.OutputOutputnlines.
