Ciel and Flipboardtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutFox Ciel has a board withnrows andncolumns, there is one integer in each cell.It's known thatnis an odd number, so let's introduce. Fox Ciel can do the following operation many times: she choose a sub-board with sizexrows andxcolumns, then all numbers in it will be multiplied by -1.Return the maximal sum of numbers in the board that she can get by these operations.InputThe first line contains an integern, (1 ≤n≤ 33, andnis an odd integer) — the size of the board.Each of the nextnlines containsnintegers — the numbers in the board. Each number doesn't exceed1000by its absolute value.OutputOutput a single integer: the maximal sum of numbers in the board that can be accomplished.ExamplesInput3-1 -1 1-1 1 -11 -1 -1Output9Input5-2 0 0 0 -20 -2 0 -2 00 0 -2 0 00 -2 0 -2 0-2 0 0 0 -2Output18NoteIn the first test, we can apply this operation twice: first on the top left2 × 2sub-board, then on the bottom right2 × 2sub-board. Then all numbers will become positive.",
