Army Creationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAs you might remember from our previous rounds, Vova really likes computer games. Now he is playing a strategy game known as Rage of Empires.In the game Vova can hirendifferent warriors;ith warrior has the typeai. Vova wants to create abalancedarmy hiring some subset of warriors. An army is calledbalancedif for each type of warrior present in the game there are not more thankwarriors of this type in the army. Of course, Vova wants his army to be as large as possible.To make things more complicated, Vova has to considerqdifferent plans of creating his army.ith plan allows him to hire only warriors whose numbers are not less thanliand not greater thanri.Help Vova to determine the largest size of abalancedarmy for each plan.Be aware that the plans are given in a modified way. See input section for details.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n,k≤ 100000).The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...an(1 ≤ai≤ 100000).The third line contains one integerq(1 ≤q≤ 100000).Thenqlines follow.ith line contains two numbersxiandyiwhich representith plan (1 ≤xi,yi≤n).You have to keep track of the answer to the last plan (let's call itlast). In the beginninglast= 0. Then to restore values ofliandrifor theith plan, you have to do the following:li= ((xi+last)modn) + 1;ri= ((yi+last)modn) + 1;Ifli>ri, swapliandri.OutputPrintqnumbers.ith number must be equal to the maximum size of abalancedarmy when consideringith plan.ExampleInput6 21 1 1 2 2 251 64 31 12 62 6Output24132NoteIn the first example the real plans are:1 21 66 62 44 6",
