Find the maximum distance between two points from this multiset.InputThe first line of input contains the number of pointsn(2 ≤n≤ 50). Next,npairs of lines follow, each describing a single point: the first line containsx-coordinate, the second one — they-coordinate (- 50 ≤x,y≤ 50). Some of the points can have identical coordinates.OutputOutput the maximum distance between two points from this multiset. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed10- 4.ExamplesInput3012345Output5.656854249Input31012-581012Output15.5241747NoteIn the first case the maximum distance is between points(0, 1)and(4, 5). In the second case two of the points are the same, so the maximum distance is between one of them and the third point.",
