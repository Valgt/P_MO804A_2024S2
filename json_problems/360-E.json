    "statement": "E. Levko and Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLevko loves sports pathfinding competitions in his city very much. In order to boost his performance, Levko spends his spare time practicing. The practice is a game.The city consists ofnintersections connected bym+kdirected roads. Two or more roads can connect the same pair of intersections. Besides, there can be roads leading from an intersection to itself.Levko and Zenyk are playing a game. First Levko stands on intersections1, and Zenyk stands on intersections2. They both want to get to intersectionf. The person who does it quicker wins. If they get there at the same time, the game ends with a draw. By agreement both players start simultaneously and move with the same speed.Levko wants to win very much. He knows the lengths of all the roads in the city. Also he knows that he can change the lengths of some roads (there areksuch roads at all) if he pays the government. So, the government can change the length of thei-th road to any integer value in the segment [li,ri] (both borders inclusive). Levko wondered if he can reconstruct the roads so as to win the game and whether he can hope for the draw if he cannot win.You should consider that both players play optimally well. It is guaranteed that we can get from intersectionss1ands2to intersectionf.InputThe first line contains three integersn,mandk(1 ≤n,m≤ 104,1 ≤k≤ 100). The second line contains three integerss1,s2andf(1 ≤s1,s2,f≤n).The nextmlines contains the descriptions of the roads that cannot be changed by Levko. Each line contains three integersai,biandci(1 ≤ai,bi≤n, 1 ≤ci≤ 109), representing a road from intersectionaito intersectionbiof lengthci.The nextklines contains the descriptions of the roads that can be changed by Levko. Each line contains four integersai,bi,liandri(1 ≤ai,bi≤n, 1 ≤li≤ri≤ 109), representing a road from intersectionaito intersectionbi, Levko can set the road's length within limits[li,ri].Consider all intersections numbered from 1 ton. It is guaranteed that you can get from intersectionss1ands2to intersectionf.OutputIn the first line print string \"WIN\" (without the quotes) if Levko can win this game, string \"DRAW\" (without the quotes) if Levko can end the game with a draw and \"LOSE\" (without the quotes) if he loses for sure.If the answer is \"WIN\" or \"DRAW\", then print on the second linekspace-separated integers — the length of the roads Levko sets in the order they occur in the input.ExamplesInput4 1 31 3 43 2 21 2 1 32 4 1 33 4 1 3OutputWIN1 1 3Input4 1 31 3 43 2 21 2 1 32 4 1 33 4 1 2OutputDRAW1 1 2Input5 4 21 2 51 3 31 4 42 3 22 4 33 5 1 54 5 4 7OutputLOSE",
