Shrink-Reversetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ (a string consisting of $$$n$$$ characters, and each character is either0or1).Let's look at $$$s$$$ as at a binary representation of some integer, and name that integer as thevalueof string $$$s$$$. For example, the value of000is $$$0$$$, the value of01101is $$$13$$$, \"100000\" is $$$32$$$ and so on.You can perform at most $$$k$$$ operations on $$$s$$$. Each operation should have one of the two following types:SWAP: choose two indices $$$i < j$$$ in $$$s$$$ and swap $$$s_i$$$ with $$$s_j$$$;SHRINK-REVERSE: delete all leading zeroes from $$$s$$$ and reverse $$$s$$$.For example, after you performSHRINK-REVERSEon000101100, you'll get001101.What is the minimum value of $$$s$$$ you can achieve by performing at most $$$k$$$ operations on $$$s$$$?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$ and the maximum number of operations.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters0and/or1.Additional constraint on the input: $$$s$$$ containsat least one1.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum value of $$$s$$$ you can achieve using no more than $$$k$$$ operations. Since the answer may be too large, print it modulo $$$10^{9} + 7$$$.Note that you need to minimize the original value, not the remainder.ExamplesInput8 210010010Output7Input8 201101000Output7Input30 30111111111111111111111111111111Output73741816Input14 110110001111100Output3197NoteIn the first example, one of the optimal strategies is the following:10010010$$$\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\texttt{SWAP}}$$$00010110;00010110$$$\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\texttt{SWAP}}$$$00000111.The value of00000111is $$$7$$$.In the second example, one of the optimal strategies is the following:01101000$$$\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\texttt{SHRINK}}$$$1101000$$$\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\texttt{REVERSE}}$$$0001011;0001011$$$\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\texttt{SWAP}}$$$0000111.The value of0000111is $$$7$$$.",
