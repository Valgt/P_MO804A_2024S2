    "statement": "B. Multiply by 2, divide by 6time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer $$$n$$$. In one move, you can either multiply $$$n$$$ by two or divide $$$n$$$ by $$$6$$$ (if it is divisible by $$$6$$$ without the remainder).Your task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain $$$1$$$ from $$$n$$$ or determine if it's impossible to do that.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — the minimum number of moves needed to obtain $$$1$$$ from $$$n$$$ if it's possible to do that or-1if it's impossible to obtain $$$1$$$ from $$$n$$$.ExampleInput7 1 2 3 12 12345 15116544 387420489Output0 -1 2 -1 -1 12 36NoteConsider the sixth test case of the example.
