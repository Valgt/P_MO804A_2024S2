Impressionismtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBurenka has two pictures $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, which are tables of the same size $$$n \\\\times m$$$. Each cell of each painting has a color — a number from $$$0$$$ to $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, and there are no repeating colors in any row or column of each of the two paintings, except color $$$0$$$.Burenka wants to get a picture $$$b$$$ from the picture $$$a$$$. To achieve her goal, Burenka can perform one of $$$2$$$ operations: swap any two rows of $$$a$$$ or any two of its columns. Tell Burenka if she can fulfill what she wants, and if so, tell her the sequence of actions.The rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from top to bottom, the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the sizes of the table.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \\\\ldots, a_{i, m}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_{i,j} \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the colors of the $$$i$$$-th row of picture $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that there are no identical colors in the same row or column, except color $$$0$$$.The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_{i, 1}, b_{i, 2}, \\\\ldots, b_{i, m}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq b_{i,j} \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the colors of the $$$i$$$-th row of picture $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that there are no identical colors in the same row or column, except color $$$0$$$.OutputIn the first line print the number $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to achieve what Burenka wants, otherwise print the number of actions in your solution $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$). It can be proved that if a solution exists, then there exists a solution where $$$k \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.In the next $$$k$$$ lines print the operations. First print the type of the operation ($$$1$$$ — swap rows, $$$2$$$ — columns), and then print the two indices of rows or columns to which the operation is applied.Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.ExamplesInput3 3 1 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1 2 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 2Output1 1 1 3Input4 4 0 0 1 2 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0Output4 1 3 4 2 3 4 2 2 3 2 1 2Input3 3 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0Output-1",
