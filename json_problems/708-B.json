One can prove that if at least one answer exists, there exists an answer of length no more than1 000 000.InputThe only line of the input contains four non-negative integersa00,a01,a10anda11. Each of them doesn't exceed109.OutputIf there exists a non-empty string that matches four integers from the input, print it in the only line of the output. Otherwise, print \"Impossible\".
