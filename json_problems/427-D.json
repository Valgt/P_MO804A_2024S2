They have got two suspiciously encoded stringss1ands2from two different frequencies as signals. They are suspecting that these two strings are from two different criminals and they are planning to do some evil task.Now they are trying to find a common substring of minimum length between these two strings. The substring must occur only once in the first string, and also it must occur only once in the second string.Given two stringss1ands2consist of lowercase Latin letters, find the smallest (by length) common substringpof boths1ands2, wherepis a unique substring ins1and also ins2. See notes for formal definition of substring and uniqueness.InputThe first line of input containss1and the second line containss2(1 ≤ |s1|, |s2| ≤ 5000). Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters.OutputPrint the length of the smallest common unique substring ofs1ands2.
