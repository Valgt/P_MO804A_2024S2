K-th Not Divisible by ntime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Print the $$$k$$$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $$$n$$$.For example, if $$$n=3$$$, and $$$k=7$$$, then all numbers that are not divisible by $$$3$$$ are: $$$1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 \\\\dots$$$. The $$$7$$$-th number among them is $$$10$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases in the input. Next, $$$t$$$ test cases are given, one per line.Each test case is two positive integers $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case print the $$$k$$$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $$$n$$$.ExampleInput6 3 7 4 12 2 1000000000 7 97 1000000000 1000000000 2 1Output10 15 1999999999 113 1000000001 1",
