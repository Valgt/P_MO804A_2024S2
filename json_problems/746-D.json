Green and Black Teatime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputInnokentiy likes tea very much and today he wants to drink exactlyncups of tea. He would be happy to drink more but he had exactlyntea bags,aof them are green andbare black.Innokentiy doesn't like to drink the same tea (green or black) more thanktimes in a row. Your task is to determine the order of brewing tea bags so that Innokentiy will be able to drinkncups of tea, without drinking the same tea more thanktimes in a row, or to inform that it is impossible. Each tea bag has to be used exactly once.InputThe first line contains four integersn,k,aandb(1 ≤k≤n≤ 105,0 ≤a,b≤n) — the number of cups of tea Innokentiy wants to drink, the maximum number of cups of same tea he can drink in a row, the number of tea bags of green and black tea. It is guaranteed thata+b=n.OutputIf it is impossible to drinkncups of tea, print \"NO\" (without quotes).Otherwise, print the string of the lengthn, which consists of characters 'G' and 'B'. If some character equals 'G', then the corresponding cup of tea should be green. If some character equals 'B', then the corresponding cup of tea should be black.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput5 1 3 2OutputGBGBGInput7 2 2 5OutputBBGBGBBInput4 3 4 0OutputNO",
