These cities are located on a straight line, we'll denote them from left to right asc1,c2, ...,cn. The Old Peykan wants to travel from cityc1tocnusing roads. There are(n- 1)one wayroads, thei-th road goes from citycito cityci+ 1and isdikilometers long.The Old Peykan travels 1 kilometer in 1 hour and consumes 1 liter of fuel during this time.Each cityci(except for the last citycn) has a supply ofsiliters of fuel which immediately transfers to the Old Peykan if it passes the city or stays in it. This supply refreshes instantlykhours after it transfers. The Old Peykan can stay in a city for a while and fill its fuel tank many times.Initially (at time zero) the Old Peykan is at cityc1ands1liters of fuel is transferred to it's empty tank fromc1's supply. The Old Peykan's fuel tank capacity is unlimited. Old Peykan can not continue its travel if its tank is emptied strictly between two cities.Find the minimum time the Old Peykan needs to reach citycn.InputThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integersmandk(1 ≤m,k≤ 1000). The valuemspecifies the number of roads between cities which is equal ton- 1.The next line containsmspace-separated integersd1,d2, ...,dm(1 ≤di≤ 1000)and the following line containsmspace-separated integerss1,s2, ...,sm(1 ≤si≤ 1000).OutputIn the only line of the output print a single integer — the minimum time required for The Old Peykan to reach citycnfrom cityc1.ExamplesInput4 61 2 5 22 3 3 4Output10Input2 35 65 5Output14NoteIn the second sample above, the Old Peykan stays inc1for 3 hours.",
