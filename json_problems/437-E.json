He has to find the number of ways to split the polygon into non-degenerate triangles, each way must satisfy the following requirements:each vertex of each triangle is one of the polygon vertex;each side of the polygon must be the side of exactly one triangle;the area of intersection of every two triangles equals to zero, and the sum of all areas of triangles equals to the area of the polygon;each triangle must be completely inside the polygon;each side of each triangle must contain exactly two vertices of the polygon.The picture below depicts an example of a correct splitting.Please, help the child. Calculate the described number of ways modulo1000000007(109+  7)for him.InputThe first line contains one integern(3 ≤n≤ 200)— the number of vertices of the polygon. Then follownlines, each line containing two integers. Thei-th line containsxi,yi(|xi|, |yi| ≤ 107)— thei-th vertex of the polygon in clockwise or counterclockwise order.It's guaranteed that the polygon is simple.OutputOutput the number of ways modulo1000000007(109+  7).ExamplesInput40 00 11 11 0Output2Input40 01 00 1-1 0Output1Input50 01 01 10 1-2 -1Output3NoteIn the first sample, there are two possible splittings:In the second sample, there are only one possible splitting:",
