Dungeontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are playing a new computer game in which you have to fight monsters. In a dungeon you are trying to clear, you met three monsters; the first of them has $$$a$$$ health points, the second has $$$b$$$ health points, and the third has $$$c$$$.To kill the monsters, you can use a cannon that, when fired, deals $$$1$$$ damage to the selected monster. Every $$$7$$$-th (i. e. shots with numbers $$$7$$$, $$$14$$$, $$$21$$$ etc.) cannon shot isenhancedand deals $$$1$$$ damage toallmonsters, not just one of them. If some monster's current amount of health points is $$$0$$$, it can't be targeted by a regular shot and does not receive damage from anenhancedshot.You want to pass the dungeon beautifully, i. e., kill all the monsters with the sameenhancedshot (i. e. after someenhancedshot, the health points of each of the monsters should become equal to $$$0$$$for the first time). Each shot must hit a monster, i. e. each shot deals damage to at least one monster.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of a single line that contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b, c \\\\le 10^8$$$) — the number of health points each monster has.OutputFor each test case, printYESif you can kill all the monsters with the sameenhancedshot. Otherwise, printNO. You may print each letter in any case (for example,YES,Yes,yes,yEswill all be recognized as positive answer).ExampleInput3 3 2 4 1 1 1 10 1 7OutputYES NO NONoteIn the first test case, you can do as follows: $$$1$$$-th shot to the first monster, $$$2$$$-th shot to the second monster, $$$3$$$-th shot to the third monster, $$$4$$$-th shot to the first monster, $$$5$$$-th shot to the third monster, $$$6$$$-th shot to the third monster, and $$$7$$$-thenhancedshot will kill all the monsters.In the second test case, you can't kill monsters with the sameenhancedshot, because the total number of health points of monsters is $$$3$$$, and you will kill them in the first 3 shots.",
