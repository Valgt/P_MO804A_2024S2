Common Divisorstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutVasya has recently learned at school what a number's divisor is and decided to determine a string's divisor. Here is what he came up with.Stringais the divisor of stringbif and only if there exists a positive integerxsuch that if we write out stringaconsecutivelyxtimes, we get stringb. For example, string \"abab\" has two divisors â€” \"ab\" and \"abab\".Now Vasya wants to write a program that calculates the number of common divisors of two strings. Please help him.InputThe first input line contains a non-empty strings1.The second input line contains a non-empty strings2.Lengths of stringss1ands2are positive and do not exceed105. The strings only consist of lowercase Latin letters.OutputPrint the number of common divisors of stringss1ands2.ExamplesInputabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdOutput2InputaaaaaOutput1NoteIn first sample the common divisors are strings \"abcd\" and \"abcdabcd\".In the second sample the common divisor is a single string \"a\". String \"aa\" isn't included in the answer as it isn't a divisor of string \"aaa\".",
