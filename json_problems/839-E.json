Mother of Dragonstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere arencastles in the Lannister's Kingdom and some walls connect two castles, no two castles are connected by more than one wall, no wall connects a castle to itself.Sir Jaime Lannister has discovered that Daenerys Targaryen is going to attack his kingdom soon. Therefore he wants to defend his kingdom. He haskliters of a strange liquid. He wants to distribute that liquid among the castles, so each castle may contain some liquid (possibly zero or non-integer number of liters). After that the stability of a wall is defined as follows: if the wall connects two castlesaandb, and they containxandyliters of that liquid, respectively, then the strength of that wall isx·y.Your task is to print the maximum possible sum of stabilities of the walls that Sir Jaime Lannister can achieve.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 40,1 ≤k≤ 1000).Thennlines follows. Thei-th of these lines containsnintegersai, 1,ai, 2, ...,ai,n(). If castlesiandjare connected by a wall, thenai,j= 1. Otherwise it is equal to0.It is guaranteed thatai,j=aj,iandai,i= 0for all1 ≤i,j≤n.OutputPrint the maximum possible sum of stabilities of the walls that Sir Jaime Lannister can achieve.Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed10- 6.Namely: let's assume that your answer isa, and the answer of the jury isb. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if.ExamplesInput3 10 1 01 0 00 0 0Output0.250000000000Input4 40 1 0 11 0 1 00 1 0 11 0 1 0Output4.000000000000NoteIn the first sample, we can assign0.5, 0.5, 0liters of liquid to castles1, 2, 3, respectively, to get the maximum sum (0.25).In the second sample, we can assign1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0liters of liquid to castles1, 2, 3, 4, respectively, to get the maximum sum (4.0)",
