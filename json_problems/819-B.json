Mister B and PR Shiftstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSome time ago Mister B detected a strange signal from the space, which he started to study.After some transformation the signal turned out to be a permutationpof lengthnor its cyclic shift. For the further investigation Mister B need some basis, that's why he decided to choose cyclic shift of this permutation which has the minimum possible deviation.Let's define the deviation of a permutationpas.Find a cyclic shift of permutationpwith minimum possible deviation. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.Let's denote idk(0 ≤k<n) of a cyclic shift of permutationpas the number of right shifts needed to reach this shift, for example:k= 0: shiftp1,p2, ...pn,k= 1: shiftpn,p1, ...pn- 1,...,k=n- 1: shiftp2,p3, ...pn,p1.InputFirst line contains single integern(2 ≤n≤ 106) — the length of the permutation.The second line containsnspace-separated integersp1,p2, ...,pn(1 ≤pi≤n) — the elements of the permutation. It is guaranteed that all elements are distinct.OutputPrint two integers: the minimum deviation of cyclic shifts of permutationpand the id of such shift. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput31 2 3Output0 0Input32 3 1Output0 1Input33 2 1Output2 1NoteIn the first sample test the given permutationpis the identity permutation, that's why its deviation equals to0, the shift id equals to0as well.In the second sample test the deviation ofpequals to4, the deviation of the1-st cyclic shift(1, 2, 3)equals to0, the deviation of the2-nd cyclic shift(3, 1, 2)equals to4, the optimal is the1-st cyclic shift.In the third sample test the deviation ofpequals to4, the deviation of the1-st cyclic shift(1, 3, 2)equals to2, the deviation of the2-nd cyclic shift(2, 1, 3)also equals to2, so the optimal are both1-st and2-nd cyclic shifts.",
