The game is very simple. First Vasya tosses a coinxtimes, then Petya tosses a coinytimes. If the tossing player gets head, he scores one point. If he gets tail, nobody gets any points. The winner is the player with most points by the end of the game. If boys have the same number of points, the game finishes with a draw.At some point, Valera lost his count, and so he can not say exactly what the score is at the end of the game. But there are things he remembers for sure. He remembers that the entire game Vasya got heads at leastatimes, and Petya got heads at leastbtimes. Moreover, he knows that the winner of the game was Vasya. Valera wants to use this information to know every possible outcome of the game, which do not contradict his memories.InputThe single line contains four integersx,y,a,b(1 ≤a≤x≤ 100, 1 ≤b≤y≤ 100). The numbers on the line are separated by a space.OutputIn the first line print integern— the number of possible outcomes of the game. Then onnlines print the outcomes. On thei-th line print a space-separated pair of integersci,di— the number of heads Vasya and Petya got in thei-th outcome of the game, correspondingly. Print pairs of integers(ci,di)in the strictly increasing order.Let us remind you that the pair of numbers(p1,q1)is less than the pair of numbers(p2,q2), ifp1<p2, orp1=p2and alsoq1<q2.ExamplesInput3 2 1 1Output32 13 13 2Input2 4 2 2Output0",
