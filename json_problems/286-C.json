So, he has received the shaman knowledge about the correct bracket sequences. The shamans of Ultima Thule have been using lots of different types of brackets since prehistoric times. A bracket type is a positive integer. The shamans define a correct bracket sequence as follows:An empty sequence is a correct bracket sequence.If{a1,a2, ...,al}and{b1,b2, ...,bk}are correct bracket sequences, then sequence{a1,a2, ...,al,b1,b2, ...,bk}(their concatenation) also is a correct bracket sequence.If{a1,a2, ...,al}— is a correct bracket sequence, then sequencealso is a correct bracket sequence, wherev(v> 0)is an integer.For example, sequences{1, 1,  - 1, 2,  - 2,  - 1}and{3,  - 3}are correct bracket sequences, and{2,  - 3}is not.Moreover, after Vova became a shaman, he learned themost importantcorrect bracket sequence{x1,x2, ...,xn}, consisting ofnintegers. As sequencexis the most important, Vova decided to encrypt it just in case.Encrypting consists of two sequences. The first sequence{p1,p2, ...,pn}contains types of brackets, that is,pi= |xi|(1 ≤i≤n). The second sequence{q1,q2, ...,qt}containstintegers —some positions(possibly, not all of them), which had negative numbers in sequence{x1,x2, ...,xn}.Unfortunately, Vova forgot the main sequence. But he was lucky enough to keep the encryption: sequences{p1,p2, ...,pn}and{q1,q2, ...,qt}. Help Vova restore sequencexby the encryption. If there are multiple sequences that correspond to the encryption, restore any of them. If there are no such sequences, you should tell so.InputThe first line of the input contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 106). The second line containsnintegers:p1,p2, ...,pn(1 ≤pi≤ 109).The third line contains integert(0 ≤t≤n), followed bytdistinct integersq1,q2, ...,qt(1 ≤qi≤n).The numbers in each line are separated by spaces.OutputPrint a single string \"NO\" (without the quotes) if Vova is mistaken and a suitable sequence{x1,x2, ...,xn}doesn't exist.Otherwise, in the first line print \"YES\" (without the quotes) and in the second line printnintegersx1,x2, ...,xn(|xi| =pi;xqj< 0). If there are multiple sequences that correspond to the encrypting, you are allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput21 10OutputYES1 -1Input41 1 1 11 3OutputYES1 1 -1 -1Input31 1 10OutputNOInput41 2 2 12 3 4OutputYES1 2 -2 -1",
