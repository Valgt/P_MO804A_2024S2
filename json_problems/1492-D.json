Genius's Gambittime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$k$$$.Find twobinaryintegers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$x \\\\ge y$$$) such thatboth $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ consist of $$$a$$$ zeroes and $$$b$$$ ones;$$$x - y$$$ (also written in binary form) has exactly $$$k$$$ ones.You arenot allowed to use leading zeros for $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.InputThe only line contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a$$$; $$$1 \\\\leq b$$$; $$$0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq a + b \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of zeroes, ones, and the number of ones in the result.OutputIf it's possible to find two suitable integers, print \"Yes\" followed by $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ in base-2.Otherwise print \"No\".If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput4 2 3OutputYes 101000 100001Input3 2 1OutputYes 10100 10010Input3 2 5OutputNoNoteIn the first example, $$$x = 101000_2 = 2^5 + 2^3 = 40_{10}$$$, $$$y = 100001_2 = 2^5 + 2^0 = 33_{10}$$$, $$$40_{10} - 33_{10} = 7_{10} = 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 111_{2}$$$. Hence $$$x-y$$$ has $$$3$$$ ones in base-2.In the second example, $$$x = 10100_2 = 2^4 + 2^2 = 20_{10}$$$, $$$y = 10010_2 = 2^4 + 2^1 = 18$$$, $$$x - y = 20 - 18 = 2_{10} = 10_{2}$$$. This is precisely one 1.In the third example, one may show, that it's impossible to find an answer.",
