    "statement": "B. Serval and Inversion Magictime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputServal has a string $$$s$$$ that only consists of0and1of length $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ is denoted as $$$s_i$$$, where $$$1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n$$$.Serval can perform the following operation called Inversion Magic on the string $$$s$$$:Choose an segment $$$[l, r]$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq l\\\\leq r\\\\leq n$$$). For $$$l\\\\leq i\\\\leq r$$$, change $$$s_i$$$ into1if $$$s_i$$$ is0, and change $$$s_i$$$ into0if $$$s_i$$$ is1.For example, let $$$s$$$ be010100and the segment $$$[2,5]$$$ is chosen. The string $$$s$$$ will be001010after performing the Inversion Magic.Serval wants to make $$$s$$$ a palindrome after performing Inversion Magicexactly once. Help him to determine whether it is possible.A string is a palindrome iff it reads the same backwards as forwards. For example,010010is a palindrome but10111is not.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t\\\\leq 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\\\leq n\\\\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the length of string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Only characters0and1can appear in $$$s$$$.It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, printYesif $$$s$$$ can be a palindrome after performing Inversion Magic exactly once, and printNoif not.You can outputYesandNoin any case (for example, stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput34100151001070111011OutputYes Yes NoNoteIn the first test case, Serval can perform Inversion Magic on the segment $$$[1,4]$$$. The string $$$s$$$ will be0110after the magic.In the second test case, Serval can perform Inversion Magic on the segment $$$[1,3]$$$. The string $$$s$$$ will be01110after the magic.In the third test case, Serval can't make $$$s$$$ a palindrome by performing Inversion Magic exactly once.",
