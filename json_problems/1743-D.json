Problem with Random Teststime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ characters. Each character of $$$s$$$ is either0or1.A substring of $$$s$$$ is a contiguous subsequence of its characters.You have to choose two substrings of $$$s$$$ (possibly intersecting, possibly the same, possibly non-intersecting — just any two substrings). After choosing them, you calculate the value of the chosen pair of substrings as follows:let $$$s_1$$$ be the first substring, $$$s_2$$$ be the second chosen substring, and $$$f(s_i)$$$ be the integer such that $$$s_i$$$ is its binary representation (for example, if $$$s_i$$$ is11010, $$$f(s_i) = 26$$$);the value is thebitwise ORof $$$f(s_1)$$$ and $$$f(s_2)$$$.Calculate the maximum possible value you can get, and print itin binary representation without leading zeroes.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ — the number of characters in $$$s$$$.The second line contains $$$s$$$ itself, consisting of exactly $$$n$$$ characters0and/or1.All non-example tests in this problem are generated randomly: every character of $$$s$$$ is chosen independently of other characters; for each character, the probability of it being1is exactly $$$\\\\frac{1}{2}$$$.This problem has exactly $$$40$$$ tests. Tests from $$$1$$$ to $$$3$$$ are the examples; tests from $$$4$$$ to $$$40$$$ are generated randomly. In tests from $$$4$$$ to $$$10$$$, $$$n = 5$$$; in tests from $$$11$$$ to $$$20$$$, $$$n = 1000$$$; in tests from $$$21$$$ to $$$40$$$, $$$n = 10^6$$$.Hacks are forbidden in this problem.OutputPrint the maximum possible value you can getin binary representation without leading zeroes.ExamplesInput5 11010Output11111Input7 1110010Output1111110Input4 0000Output0NoteIn the first example, you can choose the substrings11010and101. $$$f(s_1) = 26$$$, $$$f(s_2) = 5$$$, their bitwise OR is $$$31$$$, and the binary representation of $$$31$$$ is11111.In the second example, you can choose the substrings1110010and11100.",
