Strange Matrixtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a matrix $$$a$$$ of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$, consisting of integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$31$$$ inclusive.Let's call the matrixstrangeif for every two distinct rows $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, both of the following conditions hold:for every set of $$$k$$$ indices $$$(x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_k)$$$, where $$$1 \\\\le x_1 < x_2 < \\\\cdots < x_k \\\\le m$$$, the equality $$$a_{i, x_1} \\\\mathbin{\\\\&} a_{j, x_1} \\\\mathbin{\\\\&} a_{i, x_2} \\\\mathbin{\\\\&} a_{j, x_2} \\\\mathbin{\\\\&} \\\\cdots \\\\mathbin{\\\\&} a_{i, x_k} \\\\mathbin{\\\\&} a_{j, x_k} = 0$$$ holds (where $$$\\\\mathbin{\\\\&}$$$ — bitwise AND of two numbers);for every set of $$$k$$$ indices $$$(x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_k)$$$, where $$$1 \\\\le x_1 < x_2 < \\\\cdots < x_k \\\\le m$$$, the equality $$$a_{i, x_1} \\\\mathbin{|} a_{j, x_1} \\\\mathbin{|} a_{i, x_2} \\\\mathbin{|} a_{j, x_2} \\\\mathbin{|} \\\\cdots \\\\mathbin{|} a_{i, x_k} \\\\mathbin{|} a_{j, x_k} = 31$$$ holds (where $$$\\\\mathbin{|}$$$ — bitwise OR of two numbers).You can perform the following operation any number of times: take any row of the matrix and a number $$$y$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$31$$$ inclusive; then apply the bitwise XOR with the number $$$y$$$ to all elements of the selected row. The cost of such an operation is equal to $$$y$$$.Your task is to calculate the minimum cost to make the matrix strange, or report that it is impossible.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 50$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le m$$$).Next, there are $$$n$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \\\\dots, a_{i, m}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_{i, j} \\\\le 31$$$).OutputFor each test case, output one integer — the minimum cost to make the matrix strange, or-1if it is impossible to make the matrix strange.ExampleInput32 3 10 1 01 0 13 2 20 12 34 55 5 50 5 17 4 228 5 16 21 97 25 31 30 80 0 5 15 131 2 3 4 5Output30 -1 24",
