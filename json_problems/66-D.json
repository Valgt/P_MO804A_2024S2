Due this wonderful event, Petya's friends decided to give him sweets. The total number of Petya's friends equals ton.Let us remind you the definition of the greatest common divisor:GCD(a1, ...,ak) =d, wheredrepresents such a maximal positive number that eachai(1 ≤i≤k) is evenly divisible byd. At that, we assume that allai's are greater than zero.Knowing that Petya is keen on programming, his friends has agreed beforehand that the1-st friend givesa1sweets, the2-nd one givesa2sweets, ..., then-th one givesansweets. At the same time, for anyiandj(1 ≤i,j≤n) they want theGCD(ai,aj)not to be equal to1. However, they also want the following condition to be satisfied:GCD(a1,a2, ...,an) = 1. One more: all theaishould be distinct.Help the friends to choose the suitable numbersa1, ...,an.InputThe first line contains an integern(2 ≤n≤ 50).OutputIf there is no answer, print \"-1\" without quotes. Otherwise print a set ofndistinct positive numbersa1,a2, ...,an. Each line must contain one number. Each number must consist of not more than100digits, and must not contain any leading zeros. If there are several solutions to that problem, print any of them.Do not forget, please, that all of the following conditions must be true:For everyiandj(1 ≤i,j≤n):GCD(ai,aj) ≠ 1GCD(a1,a2, ...,an) = 1For everyiandj(1 ≤i,j≤n,i≠j):ai≠ajPlease, do not use%lldspecificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.
