Vova and his classmates are supposed to writenprogress tests, for each test they will get a mark from 1 top. Vova is very smart and he can write every test for any mark, but he doesn't want to stand out from the crowd too much. If the sum of his marks for all tests exceeds valuex, then his classmates notice how smart he is and start distracting him asking to let them copy his homework. And if the median of his marks will be lower thanypoints(the definition of a median is given in the notes), then his mom will decide that he gets too many bad marks and forbid him to play computer games.Vova has already wrotektests and got marksa1, ...,ak. He doesn't want to get into the first or the second situation described above and now he needs to determine which marks he needs to get for the remaining tests. Help him do that.InputThe first line contains 5 space-separated integers:n,k,p,xandy(1 ≤n≤ 999,nis odd,0 ≤k<n,1 ≤p≤ 1000,n≤x≤n·p,1 ≤y≤p). Herenis the number of tests that Vova is planned to write,kis the number of tests he has already written,pis the maximum possible mark for a test,xis the maximum total number of points so that the classmates don't yet disturb Vova,yis the minimum median point so that mom still lets him play computer games.The second line containskspace-separated integers:a1, ...,ak(1 ≤ai≤p) — the marks that Vova got for the tests he has already written.OutputIf Vova cannot achieve the desired result, print \"-1\".Otherwise, printn-kspace-separated integers — the marks that Vova should get for the remaining tests. If there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput5 3 5 18 43 5 4Output4 1Input5 3 5 16 45 5 5Output-1NoteThe median of sequencea1, ...,anwherenis odd (in this problemnis always odd) is the element staying on(n+ 1) / 2position in the sorted list ofai.In the first sample the sum of marks equals 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 17, what doesn't exceed 18, that means that Vova won't be disturbed by his classmates. And the median point of the sequence {1, 3, 4, 4, 5} equals to 4, that isn't less than 4, so his mom lets him play computer games.Please note that you do not have to maximize the sum of marks or the median mark. Any of the answers: \"4 2\", \"2 4\", \"5 1\", \"1 5\", \"4 1\", \"1 4\" for the first test is correct.In the second sample Vova got three '5' marks, so even if he gets two '1' marks, the sum of marks will be 17, that is more than the required value of 16. So, the answer to this test is \"-1\".",
