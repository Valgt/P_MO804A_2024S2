Now he is flying a bomber on a very specific map.Formally, map is a checkered field of size1 ×n, the cells of which are numbered from1ton, in each cell there can be one or several tanks. Slava doesn't know the number of tanks and their positions, because he flies very high, but he can drop a bomb in any cell. All tanks in this cell will be damaged.If a tank takes damage for the first time, it instantly moves to one of the neighboring cells (a tank in the cellncan only move to the celln- 1, a tank in the cell1can only move to the cell2). If a tank takes damage for the second time, it's counted as destroyed and never moves again. The tanks move only when they are damaged for the first time, they do not move by themselves.Help Slava to destroy all tanks using as few bombs as possible.InputThe first line contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 100 000) — the size of the map.OutputIn the first line printm— the minimum number of bombs Slava needs to destroy all tanks.In the second line printmintegersk1,k2, ...,km.
