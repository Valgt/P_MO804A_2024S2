Powers Of Twotime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA positive integer $$$x$$$ is called apower of twoif it can be represented as $$$x = 2^y$$$, where $$$y$$$ is a non-negative integer. So, thepowers of twoare $$$1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \\\\dots$$$.You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Your task is to represent $$$n$$$ as thesumofexactly$$$k$$$powers of two.InputThe only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputIf it is impossible to represent $$$n$$$ as the sum of $$$k$$$ powers of two, printNO.Otherwise, printYES, and then print $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_k$$$ such that each of $$$b_i$$$ is a power of two, and $$$\\\\sum \\\\limits_{i = 1}^{k} b_i = n$$$. If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.ExamplesInput9 4OutputYES 1 2 2 4Input8 1OutputYES 8Input5 1OutputNOInput3 7OutputNO",
