In thei-th query you are given a single positive integerni. You are to representnias a sum of maximum possible number of composite summands and print this maximum number, or print-1, if there are no such splittings.An integer greater than1is composite, if it is not prime, i.e. if it has positive divisors not equal to1and the integer itself.InputThe first line contains single integerq(1 ≤q≤ 105) — the number of queries.qlines follow.
