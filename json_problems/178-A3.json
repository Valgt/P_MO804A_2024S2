Educational Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe Smart Beaver from ABBYY began to develop a new educational game for children. The rules of the game are fairly simple and are described below.The playing field is a sequence ofnnon-negative integersainumbered from1ton. The goal of the game is to make numbersa1,a2, ...,ak(i.e. some prefix of the sequence) equal to zero for some fixedk(k<n), and this should be done in the smallest possible number of moves.One move is choosing an integeri(1 ≤i≤n) such thatai> 0and an integert(t≥ 0)such thati+ 2t≤n. After the values ofiandthave been selected, the value ofaiis decreased by1, and the value ofai+ 2tis increased by1. For example, letn= 4anda= (1, 0, 1, 2), then it is possible to make movei= 3,t= 0and geta= (1, 0, 0, 3)or to make movei= 1,t= 1and geta= (0, 0, 2, 2)(the only possible other move isi= 1,t= 0).You are givennand the initial sequenceai. The task is to calculate the minimum number of moves needed to make the firstkelements of the original sequence equal to zero for each possiblek(1 ≤k<n).InputThe first input line contains a single integern. The second line containsnintegersai(0 ≤ai≤ 104), separated by single spaces.The input limitations for getting 20 points are:1 ≤n≤ 300The input limitations for getting 50 points are:1 ≤n≤ 2000The input limitations for getting 100 points are:1 ≤n≤ 105OutputPrint exactlyn- 1lines: thek-th output line must contain the minimum number of moves needed to make the firstkelements of the original sequenceaiequal to zero.Please do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams, or the%I64dspecifier.ExamplesInput41 0 1 2Output113Input81 2 3 4 5 6 7 8Output13610162440",
