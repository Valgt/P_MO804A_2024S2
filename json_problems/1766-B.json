Notepad#time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou want to type the string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters, using your favorite text editor Notepad#.Notepad# supports two kinds of operations:append any letterto the endof the string;copy acontinuoussubstring of an already typed string and paste this substringto the endof the string.Can you type string $$$s$$$ instrictly lessthan $$$n$$$ operations?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.The second line contains a string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters.The sum of $$$n$$$ doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ over all testcases.OutputFor each testcase, print \"YES\" if you can type string $$$s$$$ instrictly lessthan $$$n$$$ operations. Otherwise, print \"NO\".ExampleInput610codeforces8labacaba5uohhh16isthissuffixtree1x4momoOutputNO YES NO YES NO YESNoteIn the first testcase, you can start with typing \"codef\" ($$$5$$$ operations), then copy \"o\" ($$$1$$$ operation) from an already typed part, then finish with typing \"rces\" ($$$4$$$ operations). That will be $$$10$$$ operations, which is not strictly less than $$$n$$$. There exist other ways to type \"codeforces\". However, no matter what you do, you can't do less than $$$n$$$ operations.In the second testcase, you can type \"labac\" ($$$5$$$ operations), then copy \"aba\" ($$$1$$$ operation), finishing the string in $$$6$$$ operations.",
