In Search of an Easy Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWhen preparing a tournament, Codeforces coordinators try treir best to make the first problem as easy as possible. This time the coordinator had chosen some problem and asked $$$n$$$ people about their opinions. Each person answered whether this problem is easy or hard.If at least one of these $$$n$$$ people has answered that the problem is hard, the coordinator decides to change the problem. For the given responses, check if the problem is easy enough.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) â€” the number of people who were asked to give their opinions.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers, each integer is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. If $$$i$$$-th integer is $$$0$$$, then $$$i$$$-th person thinks that the problem is easy; if it is $$$1$$$, then $$$i$$$-th person thinks that the problem is hard.OutputPrint one word: \"EASY\" if the problem is easy according to all responses, or \"HARD\" if there is at least one person who thinks the problem is hard.You may print every letter in any register: \"EASY\", \"easy\", \"EaSY\" and \"eAsY\" all will be processed correctly.ExamplesInput30 0 1OutputHARDInput10OutputEASYNoteIn the first example the third person says it's a hard problem, so it should be replaced.In the second example the problem easy for the only person, so it doesn't have to be replaced.",
