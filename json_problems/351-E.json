Thus, Jeff got sequencep1,p2, ...,pnfor his birthday.Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequencea1,a2, ...,anis a pair of indexesi,j(1 ≤i<j≤n), such that an inequalityai>ajholds.Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequencepby -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 2000). The next line containsnintegers — sequencep1,p2,...,pn(|pi| ≤ 105).
