Each vertex $$$i$$$ has a value $$$a_i$$$ associated with it.Let us root the tree at some vertex $$$v$$$. The vertex $$$v$$$ is called adistinctive rootif the following holds: in all paths that start at $$$v$$$ and end at some other node, all the values encountered are distinct. Two different paths may have values in common but a single path must have all distinct values.Find the number ofdistinctive rootsin the tree.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.The next line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).The following $$$n-1$$$ lines each contain two space-separated integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u$$$, $$$v \\\\le n$$$), denoting an edge from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.It is guaranteed that the edges form a tree.OutputPrint a single integer — the number ofdistinctive rootsin the tree.ExamplesInput5 2 5 1 1 4 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5Output3Input5 2 1 1 1 4 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5Output0NoteIn the first example, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$ aredistinctive roots.",
