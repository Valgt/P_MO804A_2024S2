Polygon for the Angletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an angle $$$\\\\text{ang}$$$.The Jury asks You to find suchregular$$$n$$$-gon (regular polygon with $$$n$$$ vertices) that it has three vertices $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ (they can be non-consecutive) with $$$\\\\angle{abc} = \\\\text{ang}$$$ or report that there is no such $$$n$$$-gon.If there are several answers, print theminimalone. It is guarantied that if answer exists then it doesn't exceed $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 180$$$) — the number of queries.Each of the next $$$T$$$ lines contains one integer $$$\\\\text{ang}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le \\\\text{ang} < 180$$$) — the angle measuredin degrees.OutputFor each query print single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 998244353$$$) — minimal possible number of vertices in the regular $$$n$$$-gon or $$$-1$$$ if there is no such $$$n$$$.ExampleInput4 54 50 2 178Output10 18 90 180NoteThe answer for the first query is on the picture above.The answer for the second query is reached on a regular $$$18$$$-gon. For example, $$$\\\\angle{v_2 v_1 v_6} = 50^{\\\\circ}$$$.The example angle for the third query is $$$\\\\angle{v_{11} v_{10} v_{12}} = 2^{\\\\circ}$$$.In the fourth query, minimal possible $$$n$$$ is $$$180$$$ (not $$$90$$$).",
