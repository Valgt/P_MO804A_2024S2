Sonya and Problem Wihtout a Legendtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSonya was unable to think of a story for this problem, so here comes the formal description.You are given the array containingnpositive integers. At one turn you can pick any element and increase or decrease it by1. The goal is the make the array strictly increasing by making the minimum possible number of operations. You are allowed to change elements in any way, they can become negative or equal to0.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 3000) — the length of the array.Next line containsnintegerai(1 ≤ai≤ 109).OutputPrint the minimum number of operation required to make the array strictly increasing.ExamplesInput72 1 5 11 5 9 11Output9Input55 4 3 2 1Output12NoteIn the first sample, the array is going to look as follows:23567911|2 - 2| + |1 - 3| + |5 - 5| + |11 - 6| + |5 - 7| + |9 - 9| + |11 - 11| = 9And for the second sample:12345|5 - 1| + |4 - 2| + |3 - 3| + |2 - 4| + |1 - 5| = 12",
