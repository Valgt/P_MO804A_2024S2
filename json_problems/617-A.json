It turned out that the elephant's house is located at point0and his friend's house is located at pointx(x> 0)of the coordinate line. In one step the elephant can move1,2,3,4or5positions forward. Determine, what is the minimum number of steps he need to make in order to get to his friend's house.InputThe first line of the input contains an integerx(1 ≤x≤ 1 000 000) — The coordinate of the friend's house.OutputPrint the minimum number of steps that elephant needs to make to get from point0to pointx.ExamplesInput5Output1Input12Output3NoteIn the first sample the elephant needs to make one step of length5to reach the pointx.In the second sample the elephant can get to pointxif he moves by3,5and4. There are other ways to get the optimal answer but the elephant cannot reachxin less than three moves.",
