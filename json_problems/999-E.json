Reachability from the Capitaltime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ cities and $$$m$$$ roads in Berland. Each road connects a pair of cities. The roads in Berland are one-way.What is the minimum number of new roads that need to be built to make all the cities reachable from the capital?New roads will also be one-way.InputThe first line of input consists of three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5000, 0 \\\\le m \\\\le 5000, 1 \\\\le s \\\\le n$$$) — the number of cities, the number of roads and the index of the capital. Cities are indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.The following $$$m$$$ lines contain roads: road $$$i$$$ is given as a pair of cities $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u_i, v_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$u_i \\\\ne v_i$$$). For each pair of cities $$$(u, v)$$$, there can be at most one road from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$. Roads in opposite directions between a pair of cities are allowed (i.e. from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ and from $$$v$$$ to $$$u$$$).OutputPrint one integer — the minimum number of extra roads needed to make all the cities reachable from city $$$s$$$.
