He has invented his own cipher calledrepeating.Repeating cipher is used for strings. To encrypt the string $$$s=s_{1}s_{2} \\\\dots s_{m}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 10$$$), Polycarp uses the following algorithm:he writes down $$$s_1$$$ ones,he writes down $$$s_2$$$ twice,he writes down $$$s_3$$$ three times,...he writes down $$$s_m$$$ $$$m$$$ times.For example, if $$$s$$$=\"bab\" the process is: \"b\" $$$\\\\to$$$ \"baa\" $$$\\\\to$$$ \"baabbb\". So the encrypted $$$s$$$=\"bab\" is \"baabbb\".Given string $$$t$$$ — the result of encryption of some string $$$s$$$. Your task is to decrypt it, i. e. find the string $$$s$$$.InputThe first line contains integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 55$$$) — the length of the encrypted string. The second line of the input contains $$$t$$$ — the result of encryption of some string $$$s$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters. The length of $$$t$$$ is exactly $$$n$$$.It is guaranteed that the answer to the test exists.OutputPrint such string $$$s$$$ that after encryption it equals $$$t$$$.ExamplesInput6 baabbbOutputbabInput10 ooopppssssOutputoopsInput1 zOutputz",
