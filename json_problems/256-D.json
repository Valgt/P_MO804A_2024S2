For each person we know that he always tells either the truth or lies.Little Serge asked them: how many of you always tell the truth? Each of the people at the table knows everything (who is an honest person and who is a liar) about all the people at the table. The honest people are going to say the correct answer, the liars are going to say any integer from 1 ton, which is not the correct answer. Every liar chooses his answer, regardless of the other liars, so two distinct liars may give distinct answer.Serge does not know any information about the people besides their answers to his question. He took a piece of paper and wrotenintegersa1,a2, ...,an, whereaiis the answer of thei-th person in the row. Given this sequence, Serge determined that exactlykpeople sitting at the tableapparently lie.Serge wonders, how many variants of people's answers (sequences of answersaof lengthn) there are where one can say that exactlykpeople sitting at the table apparently lie. As there can be rather many described variants of answers, count the remainder of dividing the number of the variants by777777777.InputThe first line contains two integersn,k,(1 ≤k≤n≤ 28).
