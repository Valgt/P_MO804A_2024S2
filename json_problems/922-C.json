Cave Paintingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputImp is watching a documentary about cave painting.Some numbers, carved in chaotic order, immediately attracted his attention. Imp rapidly proposed a guess that they are the remainders of division of a numbernby all integersifrom1tok. Unfortunately, there are too many integers to analyze for Imp.Imp wants you to check whether all these remainders are distinct. Formally, he wants to check, if all,1 ≤i≤k, are distinct, i. e. there is no such pair(i,j)that:1 ≤i<j≤k,, whereis the remainder of divisionxbyy.InputThe only line contains two integersn,k(1 ≤n,k≤ 1018).OutputPrint \"Yes\", if all the remainders are distinct, and \"No\" otherwise.You can print each letter in arbitrary case (lower or upper).ExamplesInput4 4OutputNoInput5 3OutputYesNoteIn the first sample remainders modulo1and4coincide.",
