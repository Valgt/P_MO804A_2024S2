Many Perfect Squarestime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a set $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ of distinct positive integers.We define thesquarenessof an integer $$$x$$$ as the number of perfect squares among the numbers $$$a_1 + x, a_2 + x, \\\\ldots, a_n + x$$$.Find the maximum squareness among all integers $$$x$$$ between $$$0$$$ and $$$10^{18}$$$, inclusive.Perfect squares are integers of the form $$$t^2$$$, where $$$t$$$ is a non-negative integer. The smallest perfect squares are $$$0, 1, 4, 9, 16, \\\\ldots$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 50$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$) — the size of the set.The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ in increasing order ($$$1 \\\\le a_1 < a_2 < \\\\ldots < a_n \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the set itself.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$50$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the largest possible number of perfect squares among $$$a_1 + x, a_2 + x, \\\\ldots, a_n + x$$$, for some $$$0 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^{18}$$$.ExampleInput451 2 3 4 551 6 13 22 97110052 5 10 17 26Output2 5 1 2NoteIn the first test case, for $$$x = 0$$$ the set contains two perfect squares: $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$. It is impossible to obtain more than two perfect squares.In the second test case, for $$$x = 3$$$ the set looks like $$$4, 9, 16, 25, 100$$$, that is, all its elements are perfect squares.",
