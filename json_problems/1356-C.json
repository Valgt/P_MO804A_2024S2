Prepare state |01⟩ + |10⟩ + |11⟩time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two qubits in state $$$|00 \\\\rangle$$$. Your task is to prepare the following state on them:$$$$$$\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\big( |01 \\\\rangle + |10 \\\\rangle + |11 \\\\rangle)$$$$$$This task is very similar toproblem A1 of the Winter 2019 contest, but this time you are not allowed to use any gates except the Pauli gates (X, Y and Z), the Hadamard gate and the controlled versions of those. However, you are allowed to use measurements.You have to implement an operation which takes an array of 2 qubits as an input and has no output. The \"output\" of your solution is the state in which it left the input qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Unit {// your code here}}",
