Qualifying Contesttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVery soon Berland will hold a School Team Programming Olympiad. From each of themBerland regions a team of two people is invited to participate in the olympiad. The qualifying contest to form teams was held and it was attended bynBerland students. There were at least two schoolboys participating from each of themregions of Berland. The result of each of the participants of the qualifying competition is an integer score from0to800inclusive.The team of each region is formed from two such members of the qualifying competition of the region, that none of them can be replaced by a schoolboy of the same region, not included in the team and who received agreaternumber of points. There may be a situation where a team of some region can not be formed uniquely, that is, there is more than one school team that meets the properties described above. In this case, the region needs to undertake an additional contest. The two teams in the region are considered to be different if there is at least one schoolboy who is included in one team and is not included in the other team. It is guaranteed that for each region at least two its representatives participated in the qualifying contest.Your task is, given the results of the qualifying competition, to identify the team from each region, or to announce that in this region its formation requires additional contests.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandm(2 ≤n≤ 100 000,1 ≤m≤ 10 000,n≥ 2m) — the number of participants of the qualifying contest and the number of regions in Berland.Nextnlines contain the description of the participants of the qualifying contest in the following format: Surname (a string of length from1to10characters and consisting of large and small English letters), region number (integer from1tom) and the number of points scored by the participant (integer from0to800, inclusive).It is guaranteed that all surnames of all the participants are distinct and at least two people participated from each of themregions. The surnames that only differ in letter cases, should be considered distinct.OutputPrintmlines. On thei-th line print the team of thei-th region — the surnames of the two team members in an arbitrary order, or a single character \"?\" (without the quotes) if you need to spend further qualifying contests in the region.ExamplesInput5 2Ivanov 1 763Andreev 2 800Petrov 1 595Sidorov 1 790Semenov 2 503OutputSidorov IvanovAndreev SemenovInput5 2Ivanov 1 800Andreev 2 763Petrov 1 800Sidorov 1 800Semenov 2 503Output?Andreev SemenovNoteIn the first sample region teams are uniquely determined.In the second sample the team from region2is uniquely determined and the team from region1can have three teams: \"Petrov\"-\"Sidorov\", \"Ivanov\"-\"Sidorov\", \"Ivanov\" -\"Petrov\", so it is impossible to determine a team uniquely.",
