Yuezheng Ling and Dynamic Treetime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYuezheng Ling gives Luo Tianyi a tree which has $$$n$$$ nodes, rooted at $$$1$$$.Luo Tianyi will tell you that the parent of the $$$i$$$-th node is $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i<i$$$ for $$$2 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$), and she will ask you to perform $$$q$$$ queries of $$$2$$$ types:She'll give you three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$, $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^5$$$). You need to replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$\\\\max(a_i-x,1)$$$ for all $$$i$$$ with $$$l \\\\leq i \\\\leq r$$$.She'll give you two integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u, v \\\\le n$$$). You need to find theLCAof nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ (their lowest common ancestor).InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2\\\\leq n,q \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes and the number of queries, respectively.The second line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$a_2, a_3,\\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i < i$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the parent of the node $$$i$$$.Next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries. For each query, the first integer of each line is $$$t$$$ ($$$t = 1$$$ or $$$2$$$) — the type of the query.If $$$t = 1$$$, this represents the query of the first type. Then, three integers will follow: $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$, $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^5$$$), meaning that you have to replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$\\\\max(a_i-x,1)$$$ for all $$$i$$$ with $$$l \\\\leq i \\\\leq r$$$.If $$$t = 2$$$, this represents the query of the second type. Then, two integers will follow: $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u, v \\\\le n$$$), and you have to find the LCA of $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the second type.OutputFor each query of the second type output answer on a new line.ExampleInput6 4 1 2 3 3 4 2 3 4 1 2 3 1 2 5 6 2 2 3Output3 3 1NoteThe tree in example is shown below.After the query of the first type, the tree changes and is looking as shown below.",
