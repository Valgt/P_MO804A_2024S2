Processing Queriestime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn this problem you have to simulate the workflow of one-thread server. There arenqueries to process, thei-th will be received at momenttiand needs to be processed fordiunits of time. Alltiare guaranteed to be distinct.When a query appears server may react in three possible ways:If server is free and query queue is empty, then server immediately starts to process this query.If server is busy and there are less thanbqueries in the queue, then new query is added to the end of the queue.If server is busy and there are alreadybqueries pending in the queue, then new query is just rejected and will never be processed.As soon as server finished to process some query, it picks new one from the queue (if it's not empty, of course). If a new query comes at some momentx, and the server finishes to process another query at exactly the same moment, we consider that first query is picked from the queue and only then new query appears.For each query find the moment when the server will finish to process it or print-1if this query will be rejected.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandb(1 ≤n,b≤ 200 000) — the number of queries and the maximum possible size of the query queue.Then follownlines with queries descriptions (in chronological order). Each description consists of two integerstianddi(1 ≤ti,di≤ 109), wheretiis the moment of time when thei-th query appears anddiis the time server needs to process it. It is guaranteed thatti- 1<tifor alli> 1.OutputPrint the sequence ofnintegerse1,e2, ...,en, whereeiis the moment the server will finish to process thei-th query (queries are numbered in the order they appear in the input) or- 1if the corresponding query will be rejected.ExamplesInput5 12 94 810 915 219 1Output11 19 -1 21 22Input4 12 84 810 915 2Output10 18 27 -1NoteConsider the first sample.The server will start to process first query at the moment2and will finish to process it at the moment11.At the moment4second query appears and proceeds to the queue.At the moment10third query appears. However, the server is still busy with query1,b= 1and there is already query2pending in the queue, so third query is just rejected.At the moment11server will finish to process first query and will take the second query from the queue.At the moment15fourth query appears. As the server is currently busy it proceeds to the queue.At the moment19two events occur simultaneously: server finishes to proceed the second query and the fifth query appears. As was said in the statement above, first server will finish to process the second query, then it will pick the fourth query from the queue and only then will the fifth query appear. As the queue is empty fifth query is proceed there.Server finishes to process query number4at the moment21. Query number5is picked from the queue.Server finishes to process query number5at the moment22.",
