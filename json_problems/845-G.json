The length of some path between two vertices is the bitwise xor of weights of all edges belonging to this path (if some edge is traversed more than once, then it is included in bitwise xor the same number of times). You have to find the minimum length of path between vertex1and vertexn.Note that graph can contain multiple edges and loops. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected.InputThe first line contains two numbersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 100000,n- 1 ≤m≤ 100000) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.Thenmlines follow, each line containing three integer numbersx,yandw(1 ≤x,y≤n,0 ≤w≤ 108). These numbers denote an edge that connects verticesxandyand has weightw.OutputPrint one number — the minimum length of path between vertices1andn.ExamplesInput3 31 2 31 3 23 2 0Output2Input2 21 1 31 2 3Output0",
