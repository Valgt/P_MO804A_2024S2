Common Numbertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAt first, let's define function $$$f(x)$$$ as follows: $$$$$$ \\\\begin{matrix} f(x) & = & \\\\left\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{x}{2} & \\\\mbox{if } x \\\\text{ is even} \\\\\\\\ x - 1 & \\\\mbox{otherwise } \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right. \\\\end{matrix} $$$$$$We can see that if we choose some value $$$v$$$ and will apply function $$$f$$$ to it, then apply $$$f$$$ to $$$f(v)$$$, and so on, we'll eventually get $$$1$$$. Let's write down all values we get in this process in a list and denote this list as $$$path(v)$$$. For example, $$$path(1) = [1]$$$, $$$path(15) = [15, 14, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1]$$$, $$$path(32) = [32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]$$$.Let's write all lists $$$path(x)$$$ for every $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The question is next: what is the maximum value $$$y$$$ such that $$$y$$$ is contained in at least $$$k$$$ different lists $$$path(x)$$$?Formally speaking, you need to find maximum $$$y$$$ such that $$$\\\\left| \\\\{ x ~|~ 1 \\\\le x \\\\le n, y \\\\in path(x) \\\\} \\\\right| \\\\ge k$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{18}$$$).OutputPrint the only integer â€” the maximum value that is contained in at least $$$k$$$ paths.ExamplesInput11 3Output5Input11 6Output4Input20 20Output1Input14 5Output6Input1000000 100Output31248NoteIn the first example, the answer is $$$5$$$, since $$$5$$$ occurs in $$$path(5)$$$, $$$path(10)$$$ and $$$path(11)$$$.In the second example, the answer is $$$4$$$, since $$$4$$$ occurs in $$$path(4)$$$, $$$path(5)$$$, $$$path(8)$$$, $$$path(9)$$$, $$$path(10)$$$ and $$$path(11)$$$.In the third example $$$n = k$$$, so the answer is $$$1$$$, since $$$1$$$ is the only number occuring in all paths for integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$20$$$.",
