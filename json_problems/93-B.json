Especially if the holiday is the day of the end of exams!Despite the fact that Igor K., unlike his groupmates, failed to pass a programming test, he decided to invite them to go to a cafe so that each of them could drink a bottle of... fresh cow milk. Having entered the cafe, themfriends foundndifferent kinds of milk on the menu, that's why they orderednbottles — one bottle of each kind. We know that the volume of milk in each bottle equalsw.When the bottles were brought in, they decided to pour all the milk evenly among themcups, so that each got a cup. As a punishment for not passing the test Igor was appointed the person to pour the milk. He protested that he was afraid to mix something up and suggested to distribute the drink so that the milk from each bottle was in no more than two different cups. His friends agreed but they suddenly faced the following problem — and what is actually the way to do it?Help them and write the program that will help to distribute the milk among the cups and drink it as quickly as possible!Note that due to Igor K.'s perfectly accurate eye and unswerving hands, he can pour any fractional amount of milk from any bottle to any cup.InputThe only input data file contains three integersn,wandm(1 ≤n≤ 50,100 ≤w≤ 1000,2 ≤m≤ 50), wherenstands for the number of ordered bottles,wstands for the volume of each of them andmstands for the number of friends in the company.OutputPrint on the first line \"YES\" if it is possible to pour the milk so that the milk from each bottle was in no more than two different cups. If there's no solution, print \"NO\".If there is a solution, then printmmore lines, where thei-th of them describes the content of thei-th student's cup. The line should consist of one or more pairs that would look like \"bv\". Each such pair means thatv(v> 0) units of milk were poured into thei-th cup from bottleb(1 ≤b≤n). All numbersbon each line should be different.If there are several variants to solve the problem, print any of them. Print the real numbers with no less than 6 digits after the decimal point.ExamplesInput2 500 3OutputYES1 333.3333332 333.3333332 166.666667 1 166.666667Input4 100 5OutputYES3 20.000000 4 60.0000001 80.0000004 40.000000 2 40.0000003 80.0000002 60.000000 1 20.000000Input4 100 7OutputNOInput5 500 2OutputYES4 250.000000 5 500.000000 2 500.0000003 500.000000 1 500.000000 4 250.000000",
