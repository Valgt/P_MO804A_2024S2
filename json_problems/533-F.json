Let's assume that we have stringT, consisting of lowercase English letters. Let's choose several pairs of letters of the English alphabet in such a way that each letter occurs in at most one pair. Then let's replace each letter inTwith its pair letter if there is a pair letter for it. For example, if you chose pairs (l,r), (p,q) and (a,o), then word \"parallelogram\" according to the given encoding principle transforms to word \"qolorreraglom\".Polycarpus already has two strings,SandT. He suspects that stringTwas obtained after applying the given encoding method from some substring of stringS.
