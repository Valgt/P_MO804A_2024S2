The teacher gave pupils the task to write the letterAon the sheet of paper. It is required to check whether Petya really had written the letterA.You are given three segments on the plane. They form the letterAif the following conditions hold:Two segments have common endpoint (lets call these segments first and second), while the third segment connects two points on the different segments.The angle between the first and the second segments is greater than0and do not exceed90degrees.The third segment divides each of the first two segments in proportion not less than1 / 4(i.e. the ratio of the length of the shortest part to the length of the longest part is not less than1 / 4).InputThe first line contains one integert(1 ≤t≤ 10000) — the number of test cases to solve. Each case consists of three lines. Each of these three lines contains four space-separated integers — coordinates of the endpoints of one of the segments. All coordinates do not exceed108by absolute value. All segments have positive length.OutputOutput one line for each test case. Print «YES» (without quotes), if the segments form the letterAand «NO» otherwise.ExamplesInput34 4 6 04 1 5 24 0 4 40 0 0 60 6 2 -41 1 0 10 0 0 50 5 2 -11 2 0 1OutputYESNOYES",
