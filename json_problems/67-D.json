The setup fornrays is as follows.There is a rectangular box having exactlynholes on the opposite faces. All rays enter from the holes of the first side and exit from the holes of the other side of the box. Exactly one ray can enter or exit from each hole. The holes are in a straight line.Professor Wangdu is showing his experiment to his students. He shows that there are cases, when all the rays are intersected by every other ray. A curious student asked the professor: \"Sir, there are some groups of rays such that all rays in that group intersect every other ray in that group. Can we determine the number of rays in the largest of such groups?\".Professor Wangdu now is in trouble and knowing your intellect he asks you to help him.InputThe first line containsn(1 ≤n≤ 106), the number of rays. The second line containsndistinct integers. Thei-th integerxi(1 ≤xi≤n) shows that thexi-th ray enters from thei-th hole. Similarly, third line containsndistinct integers. Thei-th integeryi(1 ≤yi≤n) shows that theyi-th ray exits from thei-th hole. All rays are numbered from1ton.OutputOutput contains the only integer which is the number of rays in the largest group of rays all of which intersect each other.ExamplesInput51 4 5 2 33 4 2 1 5Output3Input33 1 22 3 1Output2NoteFor the first test case, the figure is shown above. The output of the first test case is 3, since the rays number 1, 4 and 3 are the ones which are intersected by each other one i.e. 1 is intersected by 4 and 3, 3 is intersected by 4 and 1, and 4 is intersected by 1 and 3. Hence every ray in this group is intersected by each other one. There does not exist any group containing more than 3 rays satisfying the above-mentioned constraint.",
