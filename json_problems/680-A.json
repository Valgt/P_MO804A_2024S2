    "statement": "A. Bear and Five Cardstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA little bear Limak plays a game. He has five cards. There is one number written on each card. Each number is a positive integer.Limak can discard (throw out) some cards. His goal is to minimize the sum of numbers written on remaining (not discarded) cards.He is allowed toat most oncediscard two or three cards with the same number. Of course, he won't discard cards if it's impossible to choose two or three cards with the same number.Given five numbers written on cards, cay you find the minimum sum of numbers on remaining cards?InputThe only line of the input contains five integerst1,t2,t3,t4andt5(1 ≤ti≤ 100) — numbers written on cards.OutputPrint the minimum possible sum of numbers written on remaining cards.ExamplesInput7 3 7 3 20Output26Input7 9 3 1 8Output28Input10 10 10 10 10Output20NoteIn the first sample, Limak has cards with numbers7,3,7,3and20. Limak can do one of the following.Do nothing and the sum would be7 + 3 + 7 + 3 + 20 = 40.Remove two cards with a number7. The remaining sum would be3 + 3 + 20 = 26.Remove two cards with a number3. The remaining sum would be7 + 7 + 20 = 34.You are asked to minimize the sum so the answer is26.In the second sample, it's impossible to find two or three cards with the same number. Hence, Limak does nothing and the sum is7 + 9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = 28.In the third sample, all cards have the same number. It's optimal to discard any three cards. The sum of two remaining numbers is10 + 10 = 20.",
