You need to find two non-empty strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that the following conditions are satisfied:Strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are bothsubsequencesof $$$s$$$.For each index $$$i$$$, character $$$s_i$$$ of string $$$s$$$ must belong toexactly oneof strings $$$a$$$ or $$$b$$$.String $$$a$$$ islexicographicallyminimum possible; string $$$b$$$ may be any possible string.Given string $$$s$$$, print any valid $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.Reminder:A string $$$a$$$ ($$$b$$$) is asubsequenceof a string $$$s$$$ if $$$a$$$ ($$$b$$$) can be obtained from $$$s$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, \"dores\", \"cf\", and \"for\" are subsequences of \"codeforces\", while \"decor\" and \"fork\" are not.A string $$$x$$$ islexicographically smallerthan a string $$$y$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:$$$x$$$ is a prefix of $$$y$$$, but $$$x \\\\ne y$$$;in the first position where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ differ, the string $$$x$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$y$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first and only line of each test case contains one string $$$s$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 100$$$ where $$$|s|$$$ means the length of $$$s$$$). String $$$s$$$ consists of lowercase Latin letters.OutputFor each test case, print the strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ that satisfy the given conditions. If there are multiple answers, print any.ExampleInput3 fc aaaa thebrightboilerOutputc f a aaa b therightboilerNoteIn the first test case, there are only two choices: either $$$a =$$$fand $$$b = $$$cor $$$a = $$$cand $$$b = $$$f. And $$$a = $$$cis lexicographically smaller than $$$a = $$$f.In the second test case,ais the only character in the string.In the third test case, it can be proven thatbis the lexicographically smallest subsequence of $$$s$$$. The second string can be of two variants; one of them is given here.",
