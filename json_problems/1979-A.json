    "statement": "A. Guess the Maximumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob came up with a rather strange game. They have an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n$$$. Alice chooses a certain integer $$$k$$$ and tells it to Bob, then the following happens:Bob chooses two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n$$$), and then finds the maximum among the integers $$$a_i, a_{i + 1},\\\\ldots, a_j$$$;If the obtained maximum isstrictly greaterthan $$$k$$$, Alice wins, otherwise Bob wins.Help Alice find the maximum $$$k$$$ at which she is guaranteed to win.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of elements in the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one integer — the maximum integer $$$k$$$ at which Alice is guaranteed to win.ExampleInput642 4 1 751 2 3 4 521 1337 8 16510 10 10 10 9103 12 9 5 2 3 2 9 8 2Output3 1 0 15 9 2NoteIn the first test case, all possible subsegments that Bob can choose look as follows: $$$[2, 4], [2, 4, 1], [2, 4, 1, 7], [4, 1], [4, 1, 7], [1, 7]$$$. The maximums on the subsegments are respectively equal to $$$4, 4, 7, 4, 7, 7$$$. It can be shown that $$$3$$$ is the largest integer such that any of the maximums will be strictly greater than it.In the third test case, the only segment that Bob can choose is $$$[1, 1]$$$. So the answer is $$$0$$$.",
