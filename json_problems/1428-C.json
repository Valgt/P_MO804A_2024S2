In this game, Zookeeper must use bombs to bomb a string that consists of letters 'A' and 'B'. He can use bombs to bomb a substring which is either \"AB\" or \"BB\". When he bombs such a substring, the substring gets deleted from the string and the remaining parts of the string get concatenated.For example, Zookeeper can use two such operations:AABABBA$$$\\\\to$$$AABBA$$$\\\\to$$$AAA.Zookeeper wonders what the shortest string he can make is. Can you help him find the length of the shortest string?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 20000)$$$  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains a single test case each, consisting of a non-empty string $$$s$$$: the string that Zookeeper needs to bomb. It is guaranteed that all symbols of $$$s$$$ are either 'A' or 'B'.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ (length of $$$s$$$) among all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer: the length of the shortest string that Zookeeper can make.ExampleInput3 AAA BABA AABBBABBBBOutput3 2 0NoteFor the first test case, you can't make any moves, so the answer is $$$3$$$.For the second test case, one optimal sequence of moves isBABA$$$\\\\to$$$BA. So, the answer is $$$2$$$.For the third test case, one optimal sequence of moves isAABBBABBBB$$$\\\\to$$$AABBBABB$$$\\\\to$$$AABBBB$$$\\\\to$$$ABBB$$$\\\\to$$$AB$$$\\\\to$$$ (empty string). So, the answer is $$$0$$$.",
