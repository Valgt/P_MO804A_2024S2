Product Sumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBlake is the boss of Kris, however, this doesn't spoil their friendship. They often gather at the bar to talk about intriguing problems about maximising some values. This time the problem is really special.You are given an arrayaof lengthn. Thecharacteristicof this array is the value— the sum of the products of the valuesaibyi. One may perform the following operationexactly once: pick some element of the array and move to any position. In particular, it's allowed to move the element to the beginning or to the end of the array. Also, it's allowed to put it back to the initial position. The goal is to get the array with the maximum possible value of characteristic.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 200 000) — the size of the arraya.The second line containsnintegersai(1 ≤i≤n,|ai| ≤ 1 000 000) — the elements of the arraya.OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum possible value of characteristic ofathat can be obtained by performing no more than one move.ExamplesInput44 3 2 5Output39Input51 1 2 7 1Output49Input31 1 2Output9NoteIn the first sample, one may pick the first element and place it before the third (before5). Thus, the answer will be3·1 + 2·2 + 4·3 + 5·4 = 39.In the second sample, one may pick the fifth element of the array and place it before the third. The answer will be1·1 + 1·2 + 1·3 + 2·4 + 7·5 = 49.",
