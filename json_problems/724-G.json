Xor-matic Number of the Graphtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an undirected graph, constisting ofnvertices andmedges. Each edge of the graph has some non-negative integer written on it.Let's call a triple(u,v,s)interesting, if1 ≤u<v≤nand there is a path (possibly non-simple, i.e. it can visit the same vertices and edges multiple times) between verticesuandvsuch that xor of all numbers written on the edges of this path is equal tos.When we compute the value s for some path, each edge is counted in xor as many times, as it appear on this path.It's not hard to prove that there are finite number of such triples.Calculate the sum over modulo109+ 7of the values ofsover allinterestingtriples.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 100 000,0 ≤m≤ 200 000) — numbers of vertices and edges in the given graph.The followmlines contain three integersui,viandti(1 ≤ui,vi≤n,0 ≤ti≤ 1018,ui≠vi) — vertices connected by the edge and integer written on it.
