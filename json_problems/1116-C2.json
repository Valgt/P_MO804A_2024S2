    "statement": "C2. \"Is the bit string periodic?\" oracletime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputImplement a quantum oracle on $$$N$$$ qubits which checks whether the bits in the input vector $$$\\\\vec{x}$$$ form a periodic bit string (i.e., implements the function $$$f(\\\\vec{x}) = 1$$$ if $$$\\\\vec{x}$$$ is periodic, and 0 otherwise).A bit string of length $$$N$$$ is considered periodic with period $$$P$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le P \\\\le N - 1$$$) if for all $$$i \\\\in [0, N - P - 1]$$$ $$$x_i = x_{i + P}$$$. Note that $$$P$$$ does not have to divide $$$N$$$ evenly; for example, bit string\"01010\"is periodic with period $$$P = 2$$$.You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:an array of $$$N$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le N \\\\le 7$$$) qubits $$$x$$$ in an arbitrary state (input register),a qubit $$$y$$$ in an arbitrary state (output qubit),and performs a transformation $$$|x\\\\rangle|y\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow |x\\\\rangle|y \\\\oplus f(x)\\\\rangle$$$. The operation doesn't have an output; its \"output\" is the state in which it leaves the qubits. Note that the input register $$$x$$$ has to remain unchanged after applying the operation.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit) : Unit {body (...) {// your code here}adjoint auto;}}Note: the operation has to have an adjoint specified for it;adjoint automeans that the adjoint will be generated automatically. For details on adjoint, seeOperation Definitions.You are not allowed to use measurements in your operation.",
