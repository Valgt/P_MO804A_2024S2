He knows that a code consists ofnnumbers, and every number is a 0 or a 1. Vasya has mademattempts to enter the code. After each attempt the system told him in how many position stand the right numbers. It is not said in which positions the wrong numbers stand. Vasya has been so unlucky that he hasn’t entered the code where would be more than 5 correct numbers. Now Vasya is completely bewildered: he thinks there’s a mistake in the system and it is self-contradictory. Help Vasya — calculate how many possible code variants are left that do not contradict the previous system responses.InputThe first input line contains two integersnandm(6 ≤n≤ 35, 1 ≤m≤ 10) which represent the number of numbers in the code and the number of attempts made by Vasya. Then followmlines, each containing space-separatedsiandciwhich correspondingly indicate Vasya’s attempt (a line containingnnumbers which are 0 or 1) and the system’s response (an integer from 0 to 5 inclusively).OutputPrint the single number which indicates how many possible code variants that do not contradict themsystem responses are left.ExamplesInput6 2000000 2010100 4Output6Input6 3000000 2010100 4111100 0Output0Input6 3000000 2010100 4111100 2Output1",
