Check that there is a point after removal of which the remaining points are located on one side of theOYaxis.InputThe first line contains a single positive integern(2 ≤n≤ 105).The followingnlines contain coordinates of the points. Thei-th of these lines contains two single integersxiandyi(|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109,xi≠ 0). No two points coincide.OutputPrint \"Yes\" if there is such a point, \"No\" — otherwise.You can print every letter in any case (upper or lower).ExamplesInput31 1-1 -12 -1OutputYesInput41 12 2-1 1-2 2OutputNoInput31 22 14 60OutputYesNoteIn the first example the second point can be removed.In the second example there is no suitable for the condition point.In the third example any point can be removed.",
