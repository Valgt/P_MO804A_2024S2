Transmitting Levelstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOptimizing the amount of data transmitted via a network is an important and interesting part of developing any network application.In one secret game developed deep in the ZeptoLab company, the game universe consists ofnlevels, located in a circle. You can get from levelito levelsi- 1andi+ 1, also you can get from level1to levelnand vice versa. The map of thei-th level description size isaibytes.In order to reduce the transmitted traffic, the game gets levels as follows. All the levels on the server are divided intomgroups and each time a player finds himself on one of the levels of a certain group for the first time, the server sends all levels of the group to the game client as a single packet. Thus, when a player travels inside the levels of a single group, the application doesn't need any new information. Due to the technical limitations the packet can contain an arbitrary number of levels but their total size mustn't exceedbbytes, wherebis some positive integer constant.Usual situation is that players finish levels one by one, that's why a decision was made to splitnlevels intomgroups so that each group was a continuous segment containing multiple neighboring levels (also, the group can have two adjacent levels,nand1). Specifically, if the descriptions of all levels have the total weight of at mostbbytes, then they can all be united into one group to be sent in a single packet.Determine, what minimum number of groups do you need to make in order to organize the levels of the game observing the conditions above?As developing a game is a long process and technology never stagnates, it is yet impossible to predict exactly what value will take constant valueblimiting the packet size when the game is out. That's why the developers ask you to find the answer for multiple values ofb.InputThe first line contains two integersn,q(2 ≤n≤ 106,1 ≤q≤ 50) — the number of levels in the game universe and the number of distinct values ofbthat you need to process.The second line containsnintegersai(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — the sizes of the levels in bytes.The nextqlines contain integersbj(), determining the values of constantb, for which you need to determine the answer.OutputFor each value ofkjfrom the input print on a single line integermj(1 ≤mj≤n), determining the minimum number of groups to divide game levels into for transmission via network observing the given conditions.ExamplesInput6 32 4 2 1 3 2746Output243NoteIn the test from the statement you can do in the following manner.atb= 7you can divide into two segments:2|421|32(note that one of the segments contains the fifth, sixth and first levels);atb= 4you can divide into four segments:2|4|21|3|2;atb= 6you can divide into three segments:24|21|32|.",
