If you erase a character, the two resulting parts of the string are concatenated without changing their order.What is the minimum number of characters you should erase from the string so that there are no$$$x$$$-primesubstrings in it? If there are no$$$x$$$-primesubstrings in the given string $$$s$$$, then print $$$0$$$.InputThe first line contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 1000$$$). $$$s$$$ contains only digits from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ inclusive.The second line contains an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le 20$$$).OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum number of characters you should erase from the string so that there are no$$$x$$$-primesubstrings in it. If there are no$$$x$$$-primesubstrings in the given string $$$s$$$, then print $$$0$$$.ExamplesInput116285317 8Output2Input314159265359 1Output2Input13 13Output0Input3434343434 7Output5NoteIn the first example there are two $$$8$$$-prime substrings \"8\" and \"53\". You can erase these characters to get rid of both: \"116285317\". The resulting string \"1162317\" contains no $$$8$$$-prime substrings. Removing these characters is also a valid answer: \"116285317\".In the second example you just have to erase both ones.In the third example there are no $$$13$$$-prime substrings. There are no substrings with the sum of digits equal to $$$13$$$ at all.In the fourth example you can have neither \"34\", nor \"43\" in a string. Thus, you have to erase either all threes or all fours. There are $$$5$$$ of each of them, so it doesn't matter which.",
