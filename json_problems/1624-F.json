Interacdive Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis problem is interactive.We decided to play a game with you and guess the number $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x < n$$$), where you know the number $$$n$$$.You can make queries like this:+ c: this command assigns $$$x = x + c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c < n$$$) and then returns you the value $$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{x}{n}\\\\rfloor$$$ ($$$x$$$ divide by $$$n$$$ and round down).You win if you guess the current number with no more than $$$10$$$ queries.InteractionThe interaction begins by reading an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 < n \\\\le 1000$$$), which is written in the input data on its own line.Then you can make no more than $$$10$$$ queries. To make a query, print on a separate line:+ c: this command will assign $$$x = x + c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c < n$$$) and then print $$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{x}{n}\\\\rfloor$$$ (divide $$$x$$$ by $$$n$$$ and round down) on a separate line.Print the answer, like the queries, on a separate line. The answer doesn't count in number of queries. To output it, use the following format:! x: the current value of $$$x$$$.After that, your program should exit.You have to use aflushoperation right after printing each line. For example, in C++ you should use the functionfflush(stdout), in Java —System.out.flush(), in Pascal —flush(output)and in Python —sys.stdout.flush().Note that the interactor is not responsive.To make a hack, use the following format: a single line must contain two numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$n$$$, separated by a space.ExamplesInput3  1Output+ 1  ! 3Input5  0  0  1Output+ 1  + 1  + 1  ! 5Input10  0  0  1  2Output+ 2  + 2  + 3  + 8  ! 20NoteIn the first sample initially $$$x = 2$$$. After the first query $$$x = 3$$$, $$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{x}{n}\\\\rfloor = 1$$$.In the second sample also initially $$$x = 2$$$. After the first query $$$x = 3$$$, $$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{x}{n}\\\\rfloor = 0$$$. After the second query $$$x = 4$$$, $$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{x}{n}\\\\rfloor = 0$$$. After the third query $$$x=5$$$, $$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{x}{n}\\\\rfloor = 1$$$.",
