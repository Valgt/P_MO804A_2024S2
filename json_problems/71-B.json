Progress Bartime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutA progress bar is an element of graphical interface that displays the progress of a process for this very moment before it is completed. Let's take a look at the following form of such a bar.A bar is represented asnsquares, located in line. To add clarity, let's number them with positive integers from1tonfrom the left to the right. Each square has saturation (aifor thei-th square), which is measured by an integer from0tok. When the bar for somei(1 ≤i≤n) is displayed, squares1, 2, ... ,i- 1has the saturationk, squaresi+ 1,i+ 2, ... ,nhas the saturation0, and the saturation of the squareican have any value from0tok.So some first squares of the progress bar always have the saturationk. Some last squares always have the saturation0. And there is no more than one square that has the saturation different from0andk.The degree of the process's completion is measured in percents. Let the process bet% completed. Then the following inequation is fulfilled:An example of such a bar can be seen on the picture.For the givenn,k,tdetermine the measures of saturation for all the squaresaiof the progress bar.InputWe are given 3 space-separated integersn,k,t(1 ≤n,k≤ 100,0 ≤t≤ 100).OutputPrintnnumbers.
