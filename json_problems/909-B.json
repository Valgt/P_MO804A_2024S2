Consider all possible segments on the coordinate axis with endpoints at integer points with coordinates between 0 andN, inclusive; there will beof them.You want to draw these segments in several layers so that in each layer the segments don't overlap (they might touch at the endpoints though). Youcan notmove the segments to a different location on the coordinate axis.Find the minimal number of layers you have to use for the givenN.InputThe only input line contains a single integerN(1 ≤N≤ 100).OutputOutput a single integer - the minimal number of layers required to draw the segments for the givenN.ExamplesInput2Output2Input3Output4Input4Output6NoteAs an example, here are the segments and their optimal arrangement into layers forN= 4.",
