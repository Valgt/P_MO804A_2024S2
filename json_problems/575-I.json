Robots protectiontime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputCompany \"Robots industries\" produces robots for territory protection. Robots protect triangle territories — right isosceles triangles with catheti parallel to North-South and East-West directions.Owner of some land buys and sets robots on his territory to protect it. From time to time, businessmen want to build offices on that land and want to know how many robots will guard it. You are to handle these queries.InputThe first line contains integerN— width and height of the land, and integerQ— number of queries to handle.NextQlines contain queries you need to process.Two types of queries:1dirxylen— add a robot to protect a triangle. Depending on the value ofdir, the values ofx,yandlenrepresent a different triangle:dir= 1: Triangle is defined by the points(x,y),(x+len,y),(x,y+len)dir= 2: Triangle is defined by the points(x,y),(x+len,y),(x,y-len)dir= 3: Triangle is defined by the points(x,y),(x-len,y),(x,y+len)dir= 4: Triangle is defined by the points(x,y),(x-len,y),(x,y-len)2xy— output how many robots guard this point (robot guards a point if the point is inside or on the border of its triangle)1 ≤N≤ 50001 ≤Q≤ 1051 ≤dir≤ 4All points of triangles are within range[1,N]All numbers are positive integersOutputFor each second type query output how many robots guard this point. Each answer should be in a separate line.ExamplesInput17 101 1 3 2 41 3 10 3 71 2 6 8 21 3 9 4 22 4 41 4 15 10 62 7 72 9 42 12 22 13 8Output22201",
