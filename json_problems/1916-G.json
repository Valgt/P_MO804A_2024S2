Optimizations From Chelsutime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices, whose vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each edge is labeled with some integer $$$w_i$$$.Define $$$len(u, v)$$$ as the number of edges in the simple path between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, and $$$gcd(u, v)$$$ as the Greatest Common Divisor of all numbers written on the edges of the simple path between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. For example, $$$len(u, u) = 0$$$ and $$$gcd(u, u) = 0$$$ for any $$$1 \\\\leq u \\\\leq n$$$.You need to find the maximum value of $$$len(u, v) \\\\cdot gcd(u, v)$$$ over all pairs of vertices in the tree.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by their description.The first line of each test case contains the number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines specify the edges in the format $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq u, v \\\\leq n$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq w \\\\leq 10^{12}$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single number equal to the maximum value of $$$len(u, v) \\\\cdot gcd(u, v)$$$ over all pairs of vertices in the tree.ExampleInput421 2 100000000000043 2 62 1 102 4 681 2 122 3 93 4 94 5 65 6 126 7 47 8 9121 2 122 3 122 4 62 5 95 6 61 7 44 8 128 9 48 10 122 11 97 12 9Output1000000000000 12 18 24",
