Letcntbe the number of nodes in the tree at any instant (initially,cntis set to1). SupportQqueries of following two types:Add a new node (indexcnt+ 1) with weightWand add edge between nodeRand this node.Output the maximum length of sequence of nodes whichstarts withR.Every node in the sequence is an ancestor of its predecessor.Sum of weight of nodes in sequence does not exceedX.For some nodesi,jthat are consecutive in the sequence ifiis an ancestor ofjthenw[i] ≥w[j]and there should not exist a nodekon simple path fromitojsuch thatw[k] ≥w[j]The tree is rooted at node1at any instant.Note that the queries are given in a modified way.InputFirst line containing the number of queriesQ(1 ≤Q≤ 400000).Letlastbe the answer for previous query of type2(initiallylastequals0).Each of the nextQlines contains a query of following form:1 p q (1 ≤p,q≤ 1018): This is query of first type whereand.
