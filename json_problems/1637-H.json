Minimize Inversions Numbertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$.You can choose any subsequence, remove it from the permutation, and insert it at the beginning of the permutation keeping the same order.For every $$$k$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$, find the minimal possible number of inversions in the permutation after you choose a subsequence of length exactly $$$k$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 50\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation.The second line of each test case contains the permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$).It is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ doesn't exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case output $$$n + 1$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th of them must be the answer for the subsequence length of $$$i - 1$$$.ExampleInput31144 2 1 355 1 3 2 4Output0 0 4 2 2 1 4 5 4 2 2 1 5NoteIn the second test case:For the length $$$0$$$: $$$[4, 2, 1, 3] \\\\rightarrow [4, 2, 1, 3]$$$: $$$4$$$ inversions.For the length $$$1$$$: $$$[4, 2, \\\\mathbf{1}, 3] \\\\rightarrow [1, 4, 2, 3]$$$: $$$2$$$ inversions.For the length $$$2$$$: $$$[4, \\\\mathbf{2}, \\\\mathbf{1}, 3] \\\\rightarrow [2, 1, 4, 3]$$$, or $$$[4, 2, \\\\mathbf{1}, \\\\textbf{3}] \\\\rightarrow [1, 3, 4, 2]$$$: $$$2$$$ inversions.For the length $$$3$$$: $$$[4, \\\\mathbf{2}, \\\\mathbf{1}, \\\\mathbf{3}] \\\\rightarrow [2, 1, 3, 4]$$$: $$$1$$$ inversion.For the length $$$4$$$: $$$[\\\\mathbf{4}, \\\\mathbf{2}, \\\\mathbf{1}, \\\\mathbf{3}] \\\\rightarrow [4, 2, 1, 3]$$$: $$$4$$$ inversions.",
