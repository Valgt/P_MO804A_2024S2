The Way to Hometime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA frog lives on the axisOxand needs to reach home which is in the pointn. She starts from the point1. The frog can jump to the right at a distance not more thand. So, after she jumped from the pointxshe can reach the pointx+a, whereais an integer from1tod.For each point from1tonis known if there is a lily flower in it. The frog can jump only in points with a lilies. Guaranteed that there are lilies in the points1andn.Determine the minimal number of jumps that the frog needs to reach home which is in the pointnfrom the point1. Consider that initially the frog is in the point1. If the frog can not reach home, print-1.InputThe first line contains two integersnandd(2 ≤n≤ 100,1 ≤d≤n- 1) — the point, which the frog wants to reach, and the maximal length of the frog jump.The second line contains a stringsof lengthn, consisting of zeros and ones. If a character of the stringsequals to zero, then in the corresponding point there is no lily flower. In the other case, in the corresponding point there is a lily flower. Guaranteed that the first and the last characters of the stringsequal to one.OutputIf the frog can not reach the home, print-1.In the other case, print the minimal number of jumps that the frog needs to reach the home which is in the pointnfrom the point1.ExamplesInput8 410010101Output2Input4 21001Output-1Input8 411100101Output3Input12 3101111100101Output4NoteIn the first example the from can reach home in two jumps: the first jump from the point1to the point4(the length of the jump is three), and the second jump from the point4to the point8(the length of the jump is four).In the second example the frog can not reach home, because to make it she need to jump on a distance three, but the maximum length of her jump equals to two.",
