Tokitsukaze and Mahjongtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu,pinzuorsouzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as1m,2m, $$$\\\\ldots$$$,9m,1p,2p, $$$\\\\ldots$$$,9p,1s,2s, $$$\\\\ldots$$$,9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least onementsu(described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:Amentsu, also known as meld, is formed by akoutsuor ashuntsu;Akoutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as[1m, 1m, 1m], however,[1m, 1p, 1s]or[1m, 4m, 7m]is NOT akoutsu;Ashuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as[1m, 2m, 3m]and[5s, 7s, 6s], however,[9m, 1m, 2m]or[1m, 2p, 3s]is NOT ashuntsu.Some examples:[2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s]— it contains nokoutsuorshuntsu, so it includes nomentsu;[4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p]— it contains akoutsu,[4s, 4s, 4s], but noshuntsu, so it includes amentsu;[5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p]— it contains nokoutsubut ashuntsu,[5p, 4p, 6p]or[5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes amentsu.Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.InputThe only line containsthreestrings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character ism,pors.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.ExamplesInput1s 2s 3sOutput0Input9m 9m 9mOutput0Input3p 9m 2pOutput1NoteIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has ashuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has akoutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get ashuntsuby drawing one suited tile —1por4p. The resulting tiles will be[3p, 9m, 2p, 1p]or[3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].",
