The festival will last for exactlyndays and each day will have a premiere of exactly one film. Each film has a genre — an integer from 1 tok.On thei-th day the festival will show a movie of genreai. We know that a movie of each ofkgenres occurs in the festival programme at least once. In other words, each integer from 1 tokoccurs in the sequencea1,a2, ...,anat least once.Valentine is a movie critic. He wants to watch some movies of the festival and then describe his impressions on his site.As any creative person, Valentine is very susceptive. After he watched the movie of a certain genre, Valentine forms themoodhe preserves until he watches the next movie. If the genre of the next movie is the same, it does not change Valentine's mood. If the genres are different, Valentine's mood changes according to the new genre and Valentine has astress.Valentine can't watch allnmovies, so he decided to exclude from his to-watch list movies of one of the genres. In other words, Valentine is going to choose exactly one of thekgenres and will skip all the movies of this genre. He is sure to visit other movies.Valentine wants to choose such genrex(1 ≤x≤k), that the total number of after-movie stresses (after all movies of genrexare excluded) were minimum.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandk(2 ≤k≤n≤ 105), wherenis the number of movies andkis the number of genres.The second line of the input contains a sequence ofnpositive integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤k), whereaiis the genre of thei-th movie. It is guaranteed that each number from 1 tokoccurs at least once in this sequence.OutputPrint a single number — the number of the genre (from 1 tok) of the excluded films. If there are multiple answers, print the genre with the minimum number.ExamplesInput10 31 1 2 3 2 3 3 1 1 3Output3Input7 33 1 3 2 3 1 2Output1NoteIn the first sample if we exclude the movies of the 1st genre, the genres2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3remain, that is 3 stresses; if we exclude the movies of the 2nd genre, the genres1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3remain, that is 3 stresses; if we exclude the movies of the 3rd genre the genres1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1remain, that is 2 stresses.In the second sample whatever genre Valentine excludes, he will have exactly 3 stresses.",
