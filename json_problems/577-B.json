Modulo Sumtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a sequence of numbersa1,a2, ...,an, and a numberm.Check if it is possible to choose a non-empty subsequenceaijsuch that the sum of numbers in this subsequence is divisible bym.InputThe first line contains two numbers,nandm(1 ≤n≤ 106,2 ≤m≤ 103) — the size of the original sequence and the number such that sum should be divisible by it.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤ 109).OutputIn the single line print either \"YES\" (without the quotes) if there exists the sought subsequence, or \"NO\" (without the quotes), if such subsequence doesn't exist.ExamplesInput3 51 2 3OutputYESInput1 65OutputNOInput4 63 1 1 3OutputYESInput6 65 5 5 5 5 5OutputYESNoteIn the first sample test you can choose numbers2and3, the sum of which is divisible by5.In the second sample test the single non-empty subsequence of numbers is a single number5. Number5is not divisible by6, that is, the sought subsequence doesn't exist.In the third sample test you need to choose two numbers3on the ends.In the fourth sample test you can take the whole subsequence.",
