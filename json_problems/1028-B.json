Unnatural Conditionstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet $$$s(x)$$$ be sum of digits in decimal representation of positive integer $$$x$$$. Given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, find some positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that$$$s(a) \\\\ge n$$$,$$$s(b) \\\\ge n$$$,$$$s(a + b) \\\\le m$$$.InputThe only line of input contain two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 1129$$$).OutputPrint two lines, one for decimal representation of $$$a$$$ and one for decimal representation of $$$b$$$. Both numbers must not contain leading zeros and must have length no more than $$$2230$$$.ExamplesInput6 5Output67Input8 16Output3553NoteIn the first sample, we have $$$n = 6$$$ and $$$m = 5$$$. One valid solution is $$$a = 6$$$, $$$b = 7$$$. Indeed, we have $$$s(a) = 6 \\\\ge n$$$ and $$$s(b) = 7 \\\\ge n$$$, and also $$$s(a + b) = s(13) = 4 \\\\le m$$$.",
