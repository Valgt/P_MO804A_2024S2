Turtle and Intersected Segmentstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTurtle just received $$$n$$$ segments and a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th segment is $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$.Turtle will create an undirected graph $$$G$$$. If segment $$$i$$$ and segment $$$j$$$ intersect, then Turtle will add an undirected edge between $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ with a weight of $$$|a_i - a_j|$$$, for every $$$i \\\\ne j$$$.Turtle wants you to calculate the sum of the weights of the edges of the minimum spanning tree of the graph $$$G$$$, or report that the graph $$$G$$$ has no spanning tree.We say two segments $$$[l_1, r_1]$$$ and $$$[l_2, r_2]$$$ intersect if and only if $$$\\\\max(l_1, l_2) \\\\le \\\\min(r_1, r_2)$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of segments.The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i, r_i, a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le 10^9, 1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the $$$i$$$-th segment and the $$$i$$$-th element of the sequence.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the weights of the edges of the minimum spanning tree of the graph $$$G$$$. If the graph $$$G$$$ has no spanning tree, output $$$-1$$$.ExampleInput451 7 32 4 63 5 56 7 93 4 452 7 31 3 64 5 56 7 91 1 441 4 31 2 13 4 51 4 431 3 12 3 34 5 8Output9 13 4 -1NoteIn the first test case, the graph $$$G$$$ is as follows:One of the minimum spanning trees of $$$G$$$ is as follows:The sum of the weights of the edges of the minimum spanning tree is $$$9$$$.In the second test case, the graph $$$G$$$ is as follows:$$$G$$$ is already a tree, and the sum of the weights of the tree is $$$13$$$.In the third test case, the graph $$$G$$$ is as follows:In the fourth test case, the graph $$$G$$$ is as follows:It's easy to see that $$$G$$$ is not connected, so $$$G$$$ has no spanning tree.",
