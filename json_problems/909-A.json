Generate Logintime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe preferred way to generate user login in Polygon is to concatenate a prefix of the user's first name and a prefix of their last name, in that order. Each prefix must be non-empty, and any of the prefixes can be the full name. Typically there are multiple possible logins for each person.You are given the first and the last name of a user. Return the alphabetically earliest login they can get (regardless of other potential Polygon users).As a reminder, a prefix of a stringsis its substring which occurs at the beginning ofs: \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\" etc. are prefixes of string \"{abcdef}\" but \"b\" and 'bc\" are not. A stringais alphabetically earlier than a stringb, ifais a prefix ofb, oraandbcoincide up to some position, and thenahas a letter that is alphabetically earlier than the corresponding letter inb: \"a\" and \"ab\" are alphabetically earlier than \"ac\" but \"b\" and \"ba\" are alphabetically later than \"ac\".InputThe input consists of a single line containing two space-separated strings: the first and the last names. Each character of each string is a lowercase English letter. The length of each string is between 1 and 10, inclusive.OutputOutput a single string — alphabetically earliest possible login formed from these names. The output should be given in lowercase as well.ExamplesInputharry potterOutputhapInputtom riddleOutputtomr",
