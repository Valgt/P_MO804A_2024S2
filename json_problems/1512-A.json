Spy Detected!time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ ($$$n \\\\ge 3$$$) positive integers. It is known that in this array, all the numbers except one are the same (for example, in the array $$$[4, 11, 4, 4]$$$ all numbers except one are equal to $$$4$$$).Print the index of the element that does not equal others. The numbers in the array are numbered from one.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 100$$$).It is guaranteed that all the numbers except one in the $$$a$$$ array are the same.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the index of the element that is not equal to others.ExampleInput4 4 11 13 11 11 5 1 4 4 4 4 10 3 3 3 3 10 3 3 3 3 3 3 20 20 10Output2 1 5 3",
