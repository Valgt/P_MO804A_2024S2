You have to replace the minimum number of numbers in it so that all the numbers in the sequence are equal to each other.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 106). The second line contains a sequence of integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 3).OutputPrint the minimum number of replacements needed to be performed to make all the numbers in the sequence equal.ExamplesInput91 3 2 2 2 1 1 2 3Output5NoteIn the example all the numbers equal to 1 and 3 should be replaced by 2.",
