Because he is a programmer, he used&as a bitwise AND for these two words represented as a integers in base64and got new word. Now Vanya thinks of some stringsand wants to know the number of pairs of words of length|s|(length ofs), such that their bitwise AND is equal tos. As this number can be large, output it modulo109+ 7.To represent the string as a number in numeral system with base64Vanya uses the following rules:digits from '0' to '9' correspond to integers from0to9;letters from 'A' to 'Z' correspond to integers from10to35;letters from 'a' to 'z' correspond to integers from36to61;letter '-' correspond to integer62;letter '_' correspond to integer63.InputThe only line of the input contains a single words(1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100 000), consisting of digits, lowercase and uppercase English letters, characters '-' and '_'.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of possible pairs of words, such that their bitwise AND is equal to stringsmodulo109+ 7.ExamplesInputzOutput3InputV_VOutput9InputCodeforcesOutput130653412NoteFor a detailed definition of bitwise AND we recommend to take a look in the corresponding article in Wikipedia.In the first sample, there are3possible solutions:z&_ = 61&63 = 61 =z_&z= 63&61 = 61 =zz&z= 61&61 = 61 =z",
