Commander Surena defines some interesting properties for non-negative integers:An integer ishappyif it is divisible by at least one of its digits and not by all of them.An integer ishappierif it is divisible by all of its digits.An integer isupsetif it's divisible by none of its digits.Surena asks you to find out if a given number is happy, happier or upset.InputInput contains a single non-negative integern(1 ≤n≤ 108).OutputWrite on a single line the type of the integer:happy,happierorupset.
