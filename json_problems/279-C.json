Also, you've gotmqueries, thei-th query is described by two integersli,ri. Numbersli,ridefine a subsegment of the original array, that is, the sequence of numbersali,ali+ 1,ali+ 2, ...,ari. For each query you should check whether the corresponding segment is a ladder.Aladderis a sequence of integersb1,b2, ...,bk, such that it first doesn't decrease, then doesn't increase. In other words, there is such integerx(1 ≤x≤k), that the following inequation fulfills:b1≤b2≤ ... ≤bx≥bx+ 1≥bx+ 2... ≥bk. Note that the non-decreasing and the non-increasing sequences are also considered ladders.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 105)— the number of array elements and the number of queries. The second line contains the sequence of integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109), where numberaistands for thei-th array element.The followingmlines contain the description of the queries. Thei-th line contains the description of thei-th query, consisting of two integersli,ri(1 ≤li≤ri≤n)— the boundaries of the subsegment of the initial array.The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.OutputPrintmlines, in thei-th line print word \"Yes\" (without the quotes), if the subsegment that corresponds to thei-th query is the ladder, or word \"No\" (without the quotes) otherwise.ExamplesInput8 61 2 1 3 3 5 2 11 32 32 48 81 45 8OutputYesYesNoYesNoYes",
