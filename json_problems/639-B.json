Bear and Forgotten Tree 3time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA tree is a connected undirected graph consisting ofnvertices andn-  1edges. Vertices are numbered1throughn.Limak is a little polar bear and Radewoosh is his evil enemy. Limak once had a tree but Radewoosh stolen it. Bear is very sad now because he doesn't remember much about the tree — he can tell you only three valuesn,dandh:The tree had exactlynvertices.The tree had diameterd. In other words,dwas the biggest distance between two vertices.Limak also remembers that he once rooted the tree in vertex1and after that its height wash. In other words,hwas the biggest distance between vertex1and some other vertex.The distance between two vertices of the tree is the number of edges on the simple path between them.Help Limak to restore his tree. Check whether there exists a tree satisfying the given conditions. Find any such tree and print its edges in any order. It's also possible that Limak made a mistake and there is no suitable tree – in this case print \"-1\".InputThe first line contains three integersn,dandh(2 ≤n≤ 100 000, 1 ≤h≤d≤n- 1) — the number of vertices, diameter, and height after rooting in vertex1, respectively.OutputIf there is no tree matching what Limak remembers, print the only line with \"-1\" (without the quotes).Otherwise, describe any tree matching Limak's description. Printn- 1lines, each with two space-separated integers – indices of vertices connected by an edge. If there are many valid trees, print any of them. You can print edges in any order.ExamplesInput5 3 2Output1 21 33 43 5Input8 5 2Output-1Input8 4 2Output4 85 72 38 12 15 61 5NoteBelow you can see trees printed to the output in the first sample and the third sample.",
