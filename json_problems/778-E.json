    "statement": "E. Selling Numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBoris really likes numbers and even owns a small shop selling interesting numbers. He hasndecimal numbersBi. Cost of the number in his shop is equal to the sum of costs of its digits. You are given the valuescd, wherecdis the cost of the digitd. Of course, Boris is interested in that numbers he owns have the maximum cost possible.Recently Boris got hold of the magical artifactA, which can allow him to increase the cost of his collection. Artifact is a string, consisting of digits and '?' symbols. To use the artifact, Boris must replace all '?' with digits to get a decimal number without leading zeros (it is also not allowed to get number 0). After that, the resulting number is added to all numbersBiin Boris' collection. He uses the artifact exactly once.What is the maximum cost of the collection Boris can achieve after using the artifact?InputFirst line contains artifactA, consisting of digits '0'–'9' and '?' symbols (1 ≤ |A| ≤ 1000). Next line containsn— the amount of numbers in Boris' collection (1 ≤n≤ 1000). Nextnlines contain integersBi(1 ≤Bi< 101000).Adoesn't start with '0'.Last line contains ten integers — costs of digitsc0,c1, ...,c9(0 ≤ci≤ 1000).OutputOutput one integer — the maximum possible cost of the collection after using the artifact.ExamplesInput4238919580 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4Output4Input?5?42203522927662432 1 6 1 1 2 5 2 2 3Output62NoteIn the second sample input, the optimal way is to compose the number453.
