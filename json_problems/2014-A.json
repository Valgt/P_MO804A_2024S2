Robin Helpstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a little bit of the outlaw in everyone, and a little bit of the hero too.The heroic outlaw Robin Hood is famous for taking from the rich and giving to the poor.Robin encounters $$$n$$$ people starting from the $$$1$$$-st and ending with the $$$n$$$-th. The $$$i$$$-th person has $$$a_i$$$ gold. If $$$a_i \\\\ge k$$$, Robin will take all $$$a_i$$$ gold, and if $$$a_i=0$$$, Robin will give $$$1$$$ gold if he has any. Robin starts with $$$0$$$ gold.Find out how many people Robin gives gold to.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 50, 1 \\\\le k \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of people and the threshold at which Robin Hood takes the gold.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 100$$$) — the gold of each person.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer, the number of people that will get gold from Robin Hood.ExampleInput42 22 03 23 0 06 20 3 0 0 0 02 55 4Output1 2 3 0NoteIn the first test case, Robin takes $$$2$$$ gold from the first person and gives a gold to the second person.In the second test case, Robin takes $$$3$$$ gold and gives $$$1$$$ gold to each of the next $$$2$$$ people.In the third test case, Robin takes $$$3$$$ gold and so only gives gold to $$$3$$$ other people.",
