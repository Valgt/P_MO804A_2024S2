    "statement": "A. Odds and Endstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWhere do odds begin, and where do they end? Where does hope emerge, and will they ever break?Given an integer sequencea1,a2, ...,anof lengthn. Decide whether it is possible to divide it into an odd number of non-empty subsegments, the each of which has an odd length and begins and ends with odd numbers.Asubsegmentis a contiguous slice of the whole sequence. For example,{3, 4, 5}and{1}are subsegments of sequence{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, while{1, 2, 4}and{7}are not.InputThe first line of input contains a non-negative integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the length of the sequence.The second line containsnspace-separated non-negative integersa1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤ 100) — the elements of the sequence.OutputOutput \"Yes\" if it's possible to fulfill the requirements, and \"No\" otherwise.You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).ExamplesInput31 3 5OutputYesInput51 0 1 5 1OutputYesInput34 3 1OutputNoInput43 9 9 3OutputNoNoteIn the first example, divide the sequence into1subsegment:{1, 3, 5}and the requirements will be met.In the second example, divide the sequence into3subsegments:{1, 0, 1},{5},{1}.In the third example, one of the subsegments must start with4which is an even number, thus the requirements cannot be met.In the fourth example, the sequence can be divided into2subsegments:{3, 9, 9},{3}, but this is not a valid solution because2is an even number.",
