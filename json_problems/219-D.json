Choosing Capital for Treelandtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe country Treeland consists ofncities, some pairs of them are connected withunidirectionalroads. Overall there aren- 1roads in the country. We know that if we don't take the direction of the roads into consideration, we can get from any city to any other one.The council of the elders has recently decided to choose the capital of Treeland. Of course it should be a city of this country. The council is supposed to meet in the capital and regularly move from the capital to other cities (at this stage nobody is thinking about getting back to the capital from these cities). For that reason if cityais chosen a capital, then all roads must be oriented so that if we move along them, we can get from cityato any other city. For that some roads may have to be inversed.Help the elders to choose the capital so that they have to inverse the minimum number of roads in the country.InputThe first input line contains integern(2 ≤n≤ 2·105) — the number of cities in Treeland. Nextn- 1lines contain the descriptions of the roads, one road per line. A road is described by a pair of integerssi,ti(1 ≤si,ti≤n;si≠ti) — the numbers of cities, connected by that road. Thei-th road is oriented from citysito cityti. You can consider cities in Treeland indexed from 1 ton.OutputIn the first line print the minimum number of roads to be inversed if the capital is chosen optimally. In the second line print all possible ways to choose the capital — a sequence of indexes of cities in the increasing order.ExamplesInput32 12 3Output02Input41 42 43 4Output21 2 3",
