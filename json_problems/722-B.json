Each line contains some space-separated words, consisting of lowercase English letters.We define a syllable as a string that contains exactly one vowel and any arbitrary number (possibly none) of consonants. In English alphabet following letters are considered to be vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and 'y'.Each word of the text that contains at least one vowel can be divided into syllables. Each character should be a part of exactly one syllable. For example, the word \"mamma\" can be divided into syllables as \"ma\" and \"mma\", \"mam\" and \"ma\", and \"mamm\" and \"a\". Words that consist of only consonants should be ignored.The verse patterns for the given text is a sequence ofnintegersp1,p2, ...,pn.

Check, if the given text matches the given verse pattern.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of lines in the text.The second line contains integersp1, ...,pn(0 ≤pi≤ 100) — the verse pattern.Nextnlines contain the text itself. Text consists of lowercase English letters and spaces. It's guaranteed that all lines are non-empty, each line starts and ends with a letter and words are separated by exactly one space. The length of each line doesn't exceed100characters.OutputIf the given text matches the given verse pattern, then print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the only line of the output.
