There arenrows numbered from1tonfrom top to bottom andncolumns numbered from1tonfrom left to right in this matrix. We'll denote the element of the matrix which is located at the intersection of thei-row and thej-th column asAi,j.Let's call matrixAclearif no two cells containing ones have a common side.Let's call matrixAsymmetricalif it matches the matrices formed from it by a horizontal and/or a vertical reflection. Formally, for each pair(i,j)(1 ≤i,j≤n)both of the following conditions must be met:Ai,j=An-i+ 1,jandAi,j=Ai,n-j+ 1.Let's define thesharpnessof matrixAas the number of ones in it.Given integerx, your task is to find the smallest positive integernsuch that there exists a clear symmetrical matrixAwith sidenand sharpnessx.InputThe only line contains a single integerx(1 ≤x≤ 100) — the required sharpness of the matrix.OutputPrint a single number — the sought value ofn.ExamplesInput4Output3Input9Output5NoteThe figure below shows the matrices that correspond to the samples:",
