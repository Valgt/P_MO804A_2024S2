There arentrees (numbered1tonfrom west to east) along a street and there is a delicious nut on the top of each tree. The height of the treeiishi. Liss wants to eat all nuts.Now Liss is on the root of the tree with the number1. In one second Liss can perform one of the following actions:Walk up or down one unit on a tree.Eat a nut on the top of the current tree.Jump to the next tree. In this action the height of Liss doesn't change. More formally, when Liss is at heighthof the treei(1 ≤i≤n- 1), she jumps to heighthof the treei+ 1. This action can't be performed ifh>hi+ 1.Compute the minimal time (in seconds) required to eat all nuts.InputThe first line contains an integern(1  ≤n≤ 105) — the number of trees.Nextnlines contains the height of trees:i-th line contains an integerhi(1 ≤hi≤ 104) — the height of the tree with the numberi.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimal time required to eat all nuts in seconds.ExamplesInput212Output5Input521211Output14",
