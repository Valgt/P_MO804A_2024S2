Problems for Codeforcestime limit per test8 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputXYMXYM and CQXYM will prepare $$$n$$$ problems for Codeforces. The difficulty of the problem $$$i$$$ will be an integer $$$a_i$$$, where $$$a_i \\\\geq 0$$$. The difficulty of the problems must satisfy $$$a_i+a_{i+1}<m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i < n$$$), and $$$a_1+a_n<m$$$, where $$$m$$$ is a fixed integer. XYMXYM wants to know how many plans of the difficulty of the problems there are modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.Two plans of difficulty $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are different only if there is an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$) satisfying $$$a_i \\\\neq b_i$$$.InputA single line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 50\\\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 10^9$$$).OutputPrint a single integer — the number of different plans.ExamplesInput3 2Output4Input5 9Output8105Input21038 3942834Output338529212NoteIn the first test case, the valid $$$a$$$ are: $$$[0,0,0]$$$, $$$[0,0,1]$$$, $$$[0,1,0]$$$, $$$[1,0,0]$$$.$$$[1,0,1]$$$ is invalid since $$$a_1+a_n \\\\geq m$$$.",
