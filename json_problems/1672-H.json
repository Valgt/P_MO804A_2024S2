Zigu Zagutime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of digits $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.You are given $$$q$$$ queries. In the $$$i$$$-th query, you are given two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$.Let $$$s=a[l,r]$$$. You are allowed to do the following operation on $$$s$$$:Choose two indices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le y \\\\le |s|$$$. Let $$$t$$$ be the substring $$$t = s[x, y]$$$. Then for all $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le |t| - 1$$$, the condition $$$t_i \\\\neq t_{i+1}$$$ has to hold. Note that $$$x = y$$$ is always a valid substring.Delete the substring $$$s[x, y]$$$ from $$$s$$$.For each of the $$$q$$$ queries, find the minimum number of operations needed to make $$$s$$$ an empty string.Note that for a string $$$s$$$, $$$s[l,r]$$$ denotes the subsegment $$$s_l,s_{l+1},\\\\ldots,s_r$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$)  — the length of the binary string $$$a$$$ and the number of queries respectively.The second line contains a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ ($$$a_i \\\\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\}$$$).Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$)  — representing the substring of each query.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th line representing the minimum number of operations needed for the $$$i$$$-th query.ExamplesInput5 3 11011 2 4 1 5 3 5Output1 3 2Input10 3 1001110110 1 10 2 5 5 10Output4 2 3NoteIn the first test case,The substring is $$$\\\\texttt{101}$$$, so we can do one operation to make the substring empty.The substring is $$$\\\\texttt{11011}$$$, so we can do one operation on $$$s[2, 4]$$$ to make $$$\\\\texttt{11}$$$, then use two more operations to make the substring empty.The substring is $$$\\\\texttt{011}$$$, so we can do one operation on $$$s[1, 2]$$$ to make $$$\\\\texttt{1}$$$, then use one more operation to make the substring empty.",
