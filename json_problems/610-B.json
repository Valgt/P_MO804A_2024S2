All the jars are numbered from1tonand thei-th jar containsailiters of paint of colori.Vika also has an infinitely long rectangular piece of paper of width1, consisting of squares of size1 × 1. Squares are numbered1,2,3and so on. Vika decided that she will start painting squares one by one from left to right, starting from the square number1and some arbitrary color. If the square was painted in colorx, then the next square will be painted in colorx+ 1. In case ofx=n, next square is painted in color1. If there is no more paint of the color Vika wants to use now, then she stops.Square is always painted in only one color, and it takes exactly1liter of paint. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of squares that might be painted, if Vika chooses right color to paint the first square.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 200 000) — the number of jars with colors Vika has.The second line of the input contains a sequence of integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109), whereaiis equal to the number of liters of paint in thei-th jar, i.e. the number of liters of colorithat Vika has.OutputThe only line of the output should contain a single integer — the maximum number of squares that Vika can paint if she follows the rules described above.ExamplesInput52 4 2 3 3Output12Input35 5 5Output15Input610 10 10 1 10 10Output11NoteIn the first sample the best strategy is to start painting using color4. Then the squares will be painted in the following colors (from left to right): 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.In the second sample Vika can start to paint using any color.In the third sample Vika should start painting using color number5.",
