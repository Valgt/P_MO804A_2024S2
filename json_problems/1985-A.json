He thinks it's particularly funny to create two new words by swapping the first character of $$$a$$$ with the first character of $$$b$$$. He wants you to output $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ after the swap.Note that the new words may not necessarily be different.InputThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$)  — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$3$$$. The strings only contain lowercase Latin letters.OutputFor each test case, after the swap, output $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, separated by a space.ExampleInput6bit setcat doghot doguwu owocat catzzz zzzOutputsit bet dat cog dot hog owu uwo cat cat zzz zzz",
