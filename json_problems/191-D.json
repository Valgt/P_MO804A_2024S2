Metro Schemetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutBerland is very concerned with privacy, so almost all plans and blueprints are secret. However, a spy of the neighboring state managed to steal the Bertown subway scheme.The Bertown Subway hasnstations, numbered from1ton, andmbidirectional tunnels connecting them. All Bertown Subway consists of lines. To be more precise, there are two types of lines: circular and radial.Aradial lineis a sequence of stationsv1, ...,vk(k> 1), where stationsviandvi+ 1(i<k)are connected by a tunnel and no station occurs in the line more than once (vi≠vjfori≠j).Aloop lineis a series of stations,v1, ...,vk(k> 2), where stationsviиvi+ 1are connected by a tunnel. In addition, stationsv1andvkare also connected by a tunnel. No station is occurs in the loop line more than once.Note that a single station can be passed by any number of lines.According to Berland standards, there can't be more than one tunnel between two stations and each tunnel belongs to exactly one line. Naturally, each line has at least one tunnel. Between any two stations there is the way along the subway tunnels. In addition, in terms of graph theory, a subway is a vertex cactus: if we consider the subway as a graph in which the stations are the vertexes and the edges are tunnels, then each vertex lies on no more than one simple cycle.Unfortunately, scheme, stolen by the spy, had only the stations and the tunnels. It was impossible to determine to which line every tunnel corresponds. But to sabotage successfully, the spy needs to know what minimum and maximum number of lines may be in the Bertown subway.Help him!InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 105,0 ≤m≤ 3·105) — the number of stations and the number of tunnels, correspondingly.Each of the nextmlines contain two integers — the numbers of stations connected by the corresponding tunnel. The stations are numbered with integers from1ton.It is guaranteed that the graph that corresponds to the subway has no multiple edges or loops, it is connected and it is a vertex cactus.OutputPrint two numbers — the minimum and maximum number of lines correspondingly.ExamplesInput3 31 22 33 1Output1 3Input8 81 22 33 44 56 44 77 22 8Output2 8Input6 61 22 32 55 63 43 5Output3 6NoteThe subway scheme with minimum possible number of lines for the second sample is:",
