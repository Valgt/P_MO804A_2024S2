Colors are numbered from1ton.i-th box containsaiballs, all of which have colori. You have to write a program that will divide all balls into sets such that:each ball belongs to exactly one of the sets,there are no empty sets,there is no set containing two (or more) balls of different colors (each set contains only balls of one color),there are no two sets such that the difference between their sizes is greater than1.Print the minimum possible number of sets.InputThe first line contains one integer numbern(1 ≤n≤ 500).The second line containsninteger numbersa1,a2, ... ,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109).OutputPrint one integer number — the minimum possible number of sets.ExamplesInput34 7 8Output5Input22 7Output4NoteIn the first example the balls can be divided into sets like that: one set with4balls of the first color, two sets with3and4balls, respectively, of the second color, and two sets with4balls of the third color.",
