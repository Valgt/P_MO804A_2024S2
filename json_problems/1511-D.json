Among all strings with length $$$n$$$ that contain only the first $$$k$$$ characters of the Latin alphabet, find a string with minimum possiblecost. If there are multiple such strings with minimumcost— find any of them.InputThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5; 1 \\\\le k \\\\le 26$$$).OutputPrint the string $$$s$$$ such that it consists of $$$n$$$ characters, each its character is one of the $$$k$$$ first Latin letters, and it has the minimum possiblecostamong all these strings.
