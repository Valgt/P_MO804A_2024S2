If she don't give him the candies at the same day, they are saved for her and she can give them to him later.Your task is to find the minimum number of days Arya needs to give Brankcandiesbeforethe end of then-th day. Formally, you need to output the minimum day index to the end of whichkcandies will be given out (the days are indexed from 1 ton).Print-1if she can't give himkcandies duringngiven days.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 100,1 ≤k≤ 10000).The second line containsnintegersa1,a2,a3, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 100).OutputIf it is impossible for Arya to give Brankcandies withinndays, print-1.Otherwise print a single integer — the minimum number of days Arya needs to give Brankcandies before the end of then-th day.ExamplesInput2 31 2Output2Input3 1710 10 10Output3Input1 910Output-1NoteIn the first sample, Arya can give Bran3candies in2days.In the second sample, Arya can give Bran17candies in3days, because she can give him at most8candies per day.In the third sample, Arya can't give Bran9candies, because she can give him at most8candies per day and she must give him the candies within1day.",
