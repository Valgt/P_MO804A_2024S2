Zero Remainder Sumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a matrix $$$a$$$ of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$ consisting of integers.You can chooseno more than$$$\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor$$$ elements ineach row. Your task is to choose these elements in such a way that their sum isdivisible by$$$k$$$ and this sum is themaximum.In other words, you can choose no more than a half (rounded down) of elements in each row, you have to find the maximum sum of these elements divisible by $$$k$$$.Note that you can choose zero elements (and the sum of such set is $$$0$$$).InputThe first line of the input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m, k \\\\le 70$$$) — the number of rows in the matrix, the number of columns in the matrix and the value of $$$k$$$. The next $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ elements each, where the $$$j$$$-th element of the $$$i$$$-th row is $$$a_{i, j}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_{i, j} \\\\le 70$$$).OutputPrint one integer — the maximum sum divisible by $$$k$$$ you can obtain.ExamplesInput3 4 3 1 2 3 4 5 2 2 2 7 1 1 4Output24Input5 5 4 1 2 4 2 1 3 5 1 2 4 1 5 7 1 2 3 8 7 1 2 8 4 7 1 6Output56NoteIn the first example, the optimal answer is $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ in the first row, $$$5$$$ and $$$2$$$ in the second row and $$$7$$$ and $$$4$$$ in the third row. The total sum is $$$2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 7 + 4 = 24$$$.",
