Recently, she found a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and some operations that allows to change this string (she can do each operation any number of times):Replace substring00of $$$s$$$ by0and receive $$$a$$$ coins.Replace substring11of $$$s$$$ by1and receive $$$b$$$ coins.Remove0from any position in $$$s$$$ andpay$$$c$$$ coins.It turned out that while doing this operations Dasha should follow the rule:It is forbidden to do two operations with the same parity in a row. Operations are numbered by integers $$$1$$$-$$$3$$$ in the order they are given above.Please, calculate what is the maximum profit Dasha can get by doing these operations and following this rule.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5, 1 \\\\leq a, b, c \\\\leq 10^9$$$).The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.It is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print the answer.ExampleInput35 2 2 1011016 4 3 51100016 3 2 1011110Output3 11 4NoteIn the first test case one of the optimal sequences of operations is01101$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$0101$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$011$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$01. This sequence of operations consists of operations $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$2$$$ in this order. It satisfies all rules and gives profit $$$3$$$. It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve higher profit in this test case, so the answer is $$$3$$$.In the second test case one of the optimal sequences of operations is110001$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$11001$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$1001$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$101.In the third test case one of the optimal sequences of operations is011110$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$01110$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$1110$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$110$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$11$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$1.",
