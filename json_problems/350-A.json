He's already got one problem and he wants to set a time limit (TL) on it.Valera has writtenncorrect solutions. For each correct solution, he knows its running time (in seconds). Valera has also wrotemwrong solutions and for each wrong solution he knows its running time (in seconds).Let's suppose that Valera will setvseconds TL in the problem. Then we can say that a solution passes the system testing if its running time is at mostvseconds. We can also say that a solution passes the system testing with some \"extra\" time if for its running time,aseconds, an inequality2a≤vholds.As a result, Valera decided to setvseconds TL, that the following conditions are met:vis a positive integer;all correct solutions pass the system testing;at least one correct solution passes the system testing with some \"extra\" time;all wrong solutions do not pass the system testing;valuevis minimum among all TLs, for which points1,2,3,4hold.Help Valera and find the most suitable TL or else state that such TL doesn't exist.InputThe first line contains two integersn,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 100).
