Destroying Roadstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn some country there are exactlyncities andmbidirectional roads connecting the cities. Cities are numbered with integers from1ton. If citiesaandbare connected by a road, then in an hour you can go along this road either from cityato cityb, or from citybto citya. The road network is such that from any city you can get to any other one by moving along the roads.You want to destroy the largest possible number of roads in the country so that the remaining roads would allow you to get from citys1to cityt1in at mostl1hours and get from citys2to cityt2in at mostl2hours.Determine what maximum number of roads you need to destroy in order to meet the condition of your plan. If it is impossible to reach the desired result, print -1.InputThe first line contains two integersn,m(1 ≤n≤ 3000,) — the number of cities and roads in the country, respectively.Nextmlines contain the descriptions of the roads as pairs of integersai,bi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi). It is guaranteed that the roads that are given in the description can transport you from any city to any other one. It is guaranteed that each pair of cities has at most one road between them.The last two lines contains three integers each,s1,t1,l1ands2,t2,l2, respectively (1 ≤si,ti≤n,0 ≤li≤n).OutputPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.
