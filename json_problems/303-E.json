Every participant will get a particular score. We can predict the standings board more or less, if we do some statistics on their previous performance.Let's say the score of the participants will be uniformly distributed in interval[li,ri](the score can be a real number). Can you predict the standings board according to these data? In other words you should say for each participant the probability that he gets some fixed place in the scoreboard.The participants are sorted by increasing of their scores in the scoreboard. So, the participant with the largest score gets the last place.InputThe first line contains integern(1  ≤n≤ 80), showing how many participants we have. Each of the nextnlines contains our predictions, thei-th line contains a pair of integersli,ri(0 ≤li<ri≤ 109)as the distributed interval for participanti.Consider the participants numbered from1tonin some way.OutputOutput a distributed matrixaof ordern.
