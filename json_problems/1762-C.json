Binary Strings are Funtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA binary string$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ $$$b$$$ of odd length $$$m$$$ isgoodif $$$b_i$$$ is the median$$$^\\\\ddagger$$$ of $$$b[1,i]^\\\\S$$$ for alloddindices $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq m$$$).For a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$, a binary string $$$b$$$ of length $$$2k-1$$$ is anextensionof $$$a$$$ if $$$b_{2i-1}=a_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq k$$$. For example,1001011and1101001areextensionsof the string1001. String $$$x=$$$1011011is not anextensionof string $$$y=$$$1001because $$$x_3 \\\\neq y_2$$$. Note that there are $$$2^{k-1}$$$ differentextensionsof $$$a$$$.You are given a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Find the sum of the number ofgoodextensionsover all prefixes of $$$s$$$. In other words, find $$$\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(s[1,i])$$$, where $$$f(x)$$$ gives number ofgoodextensionsof string $$$x$$$. Since the answer can be quite large, you only need to find it modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ A binary string is a string whose elements are either $$$\\\\mathtt{0}$$$ or $$$\\\\mathtt{1}$$$.$$$^\\\\ddagger$$$ For a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$2m-1$$$, the median of $$$a$$$ is the (unique) element that occurs at least $$$m$$$ times in $$$a$$$.$$$^\\\\S$$$ $$$a[l,r]$$$ denotes the string of length $$$r-l+1$$$ which is formed by the concatenation of $$$a_l,a_{l+1},\\\\ldots,a_r$$$ in that order.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$n$$$ is the length of the binary string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains the binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the answer modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.ExampleInput6111021130109101101111371011011111011010000011011111111011111Output1 1 3 3 21 365NoteIn the first and second test cases, $$$f(s[1,1])=1$$$.In the third test case, the answer is $$$f(s[1,1])+f(s[1,2])=1+2=3$$$.In the fourth test case, the answer is $$$f(s[1,1])+f(s[1,2])+f(s[1,3])=1+1+1=3$$$.$$$f(\\\\mathtt{11})=2$$$ because twogoodextensionsare possible:101and111.$$$f(\\\\mathtt{01})=1$$$ because only onegoodextensionis possible:011.",
