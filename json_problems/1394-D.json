    "statement": "D. Boboniu and Jianghutime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSince Boboniu finished building his Jianghu, he has been doing Kungfu on these mountains every day.Boboniu designs a map for his $$$n$$$ mountains. He uses $$$n-1$$$ roads to connect all $$$n$$$ mountains. Every pair of mountains is connected via roads.For the $$$i$$$-th mountain, Boboniu estimated the tiredness of doing Kungfu on the top of it as $$$t_i$$$. He also estimated the height of each mountain as $$$h_i$$$.Apathis a sequence of mountains $$$M$$$ such that for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i < |M|$$$), there exists a road between $$$M_i$$$ and $$$M_{i+1}$$$. Boboniu would regard thepathas achallengeif for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\\\le i<|M|$$$), $$$h_{M_i}\\\\le h_{M_{i+1}}$$$.Boboniu wants to divideall$$$n-1$$$ roads into severalchallenges. Note that each road must appear inexactly onechallenge, but a mountain may appear in several challenges.Boboniu wants to minimize the total tiredness to do all thechallenges. The tiredness of achallenge$$$M$$$ is the sum of tiredness of all mountains in it, i.e. $$$\\\\sum_{i=1}^{|M|}t_{M_i}$$$.He asked you to find the minimum total tiredness. As a reward for your work, you'll become a guardian in his Jianghu.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$), denoting the number of the mountains.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\\\ldots, t_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t_i \\\\le 10^6$$$), denoting the tiredness for Boboniu to do Kungfu on each mountain.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\\\ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le h_i \\\\le 10^6$$$), denoting the height of each mountain.Each of the following $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u_i, v_i \\\\le n, u_i \\\\neq v_i$$$), denoting the ends of the road. It's guaranteed that all mountains are connected via roads.OutputPrint one integer: the smallest sum of tiredness of all challenges.ExamplesInput5 40 10 30 50 20 2 3 2 3 1 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5Output160Input5 1000000 1 1 1 1 1000000 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5Output4000004Input10 510916 760492 684704 32545 484888 933975 116895 77095 127679 989957 402815 705067 705067 705067 623759 103335 749243 138306 138306 844737 1 2 3 2 4 3 1 5 6 4 6 7 8 7 8 9 9 10Output6390572NoteFor the first example:In the picture, the lighter a point is, the higher the mountain it represents. One of the best divisions is:Challenge $$$1$$$: $$$3 \\\\to 1 \\\\to 2$$$Challenge $$$2$$$: $$$5 \\\\to 2 \\\\to 4$$$The total tiredness of Boboniu is $$$(30 + 40 + 10) + (20 + 10 + 50) = 160$$$. It can be shown that this is the minimum total tiredness.",
