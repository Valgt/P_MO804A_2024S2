Your task is to find such subsequence that its sum is odd and maximum among all such subsequences. It's guaranteed that given sequence contains subsequence with odd sum.Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.You should write a program which finds sum of the best subsequence.InputThe first line contains integer numbern(1 ≤n≤ 105).The second line containsninteger numbersa1,a2, ...,an(- 104≤ai≤ 104). The sequence contains at least one subsequence with odd sum.OutputPrint sum of resulting subseqeuence.ExamplesInput4-2 2 -3 1Output3Input32 -5 -3Output-1NoteIn the first example sum of the second and the fourth elements is3.",
