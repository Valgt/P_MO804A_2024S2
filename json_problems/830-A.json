    "statement": "A. Office Keystime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere arenpeople andkkeys on a straight line. Every person wants to get to the office which is located on the line as well. To do that, he needs to reach some point with a key, take the key and then go to the office. Once a key is taken by somebody, it couldn't be taken by anybody else.You are to determine the minimum time needed for allnpeople to get to the office with keys. Assume that people move a unit distance per1second. If two people reach a key at the same time, only one of them can take the key. A person can pass through a point with a key without taking it.InputThe first line contains three integersn,kandp(1 ≤n≤ 1 000,n≤k≤ 2 000,1 ≤p≤ 109) — the number of people, the number of keys and the office location.The second line containsndistinct integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — positions in which people are located initially. The positions are given in arbitrary order.The third line containskdistinct integersb1,b2, ...,bk(1 ≤bj≤ 109) — positions of the keys. The positions are given in arbitrary order.Note that there can't be more than one person or more than one key in the same point. A person and a key can be located in the same point.OutputPrint the minimum time (in seconds) needed for allnto reach the office with keys.ExamplesInput2 4 5020 10060 10 40 80Output50Input1 2 101115 7Output7NoteIn the first example the person located at point20should take the key located at point40and go with it to the office located at point50. He spends30seconds. The person located at point100can take the key located at point80and go to the office with it. He spends50seconds. Thus, after50seconds everybody is in office with keys.",
