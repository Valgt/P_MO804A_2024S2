Unique Palindromestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputApalindromeis a string that reads the same backwards as forwards. For example, the stringabcbais palindrome, while the stringabcais not.Let $$$p(t)$$$ be the number ofunique palindromic substringsof string $$$t$$$, i. e. the number of substrings $$$t[l \\\\dots r]$$$ that are palindromes themselves. Even if some substring occurs in $$$t$$$ several times, it's counted exactly once. (The whole string $$$t$$$ is also counted as a substring of $$$t$$$).For example, string $$$t$$$ $$$=$$$abcbbcabcbhas $$$p(t) = 6$$$ unique palindromic substrings:a,b,c,bb,bcbandcbbc.Now, let's define $$$p(s, m) = p(t)$$$ where $$$t = s[1 \\\\dots m]$$$. In other words, $$$p(s, m)$$$ is the number of palindromic substrings in the prefix of $$$s$$$ of length $$$m$$$. For example, $$$p($$$abcbbcabcb$$$, 5)$$$ $$$=$$$ $$$p($$$abcbb$$$) = 5$$$.You are given an integer $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ \"conditions\" ($$$k \\\\le 20$$$). Let's say that string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters, isgoodif all $$$k$$$ conditions are satisfiedat the same time. A condition is a pair $$$(x_i, c_i)$$$ and have the following meaning:$$$p(s, x_i) = c_i$$$, i. e. a prefix of $$$s$$$ of length $$$x_i$$$ contains exactly $$$c_i$$$ unique palindromic substrings.Find a good string $$$s$$$ or report that such $$$s$$$ doesn't exist.Look in Notes if you need further clarifications.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 20$$$) — length of good string $$$s$$$ and number of conditions.The second line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_k$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le x_1 < x_2 < \\\\dots < x_k = n$$$) where $$$x_i$$$ is the length of the prefix in the $$$i$$$-th condition.The third line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_k$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le c_1 \\\\le c_2 \\\\le \\\\dots \\\\le c_k \\\\le \\\\min{\\\\left(10^9, \\\\frac{(n + 1) n}{2} \\\\right)}$$$) where $$$c_i$$$ is the number of palindromic substrings in the $$$i$$$-th condition.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$.OutputFor each test case, if there is no good string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ that satisfies all conditions, printNO.Otherwise, printYESand a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, that satisfies all conditions. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExampleInput710 25 105 63 1334 23 43 34 23 43 44 14510 34 6 104 5 810 44 6 7 104 5 7 8OutputYES abcbbcabcb YES foo YES ayda YES wada NO YES abcbcacbab NONoteIn the first test case, string $$$s$$$ $$$=$$$abcbbcabcbsatisfies $$$k = 2$$$ conditions:$$$p(s, x_1) = p(s, 5) =$$$ $$$p($$$abcbb$$$) = 5 = s_1$$$.
