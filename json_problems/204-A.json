Little Elephant and Intervaltime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe Little Elephant very much loves sums on intervals.This time he has a pair of integerslandr(l≤r). The Little Elephant has to find the number of such integersx(l≤x≤r), that the first digit of integerxequals the last one (in decimal notation). For example, such numbers as101,477474or9will be included in the answer and47,253or1020will not.Help him and count the number of described numbersxfor a given pairlandr.InputThe single line contains a pair of integerslandr(1 ≤l≤r≤ 1018)— the boundaries of the interval.Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to usecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.OutputOn a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput2 47Output12Input47 1024Output98NoteIn the first sample the answer includes integers2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44.",
