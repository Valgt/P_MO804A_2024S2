Let us remind you that a prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two distinct positive integer divisors.Consider positive integersa,a+ 1,...,b(a≤b). You want to find the minimum integerl(1 ≤l≤b-a+ 1)such that for any integerx(a≤x≤b-l+ 1)amonglintegersx,x+ 1,...,x+l- 1there are at leastkprime numbers.Find and print the required minimuml. If no valuelmeets the described limitations, print -1.InputA single line contains three space-separated integersa,b,k(1 ≤a,b,k≤ 106;a≤b).OutputIn a single line print a single integer — the required minimuml. If there's no solution, print -1.ExamplesInput2 4 2Output3Input6 13 1Output4Input1 4 3Output-1",
