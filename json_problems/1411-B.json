Fair Numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWe call a positive integer numberfairif it is divisible by each of its nonzero digits. For example, $$$102$$$ is fair (because it is divisible by $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$), but $$$282$$$ is not, because it isn't divisible by $$$8$$$. Given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Find the minimum integer $$$x$$$, such that $$$n \\\\leq x$$$ and $$$x$$$ is fair.InputThe first line contains number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^3$$$). Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$).OutputFor each of $$$t$$$ test cases print a single integer — the leastfairnumber, which is not less than $$$n$$$.ExampleInput4 1 282 1234567890 1000000000000000000Output1 288 1234568040 1000000000000000000NoteExplanations for some test cases:In the first test case number $$$1$$$ is fair itself.In the second test case number $$$288$$$ is fair (it's divisible by both $$$2$$$ and $$$8$$$). None of the numbers from $$$[282, 287]$$$ is fair, because, for example, none of them is divisible by $$$8$$$.",
