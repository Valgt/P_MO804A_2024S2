Chtholly's requesttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output— Thanks a lot for today.— I experienced so many great things.— You gave me memories like dreams... But I have to leave now...— One last request, can you...— Help me solve a Codeforces problem?— ......— What?Chtholly has been thinking about a problem for days:If a number ispalindromeand length of its decimal representation without leading zeros is even, we call it a zcy number. A number ispalindromemeans when written in decimal representation, it contains no leading zeros and reads the same forwards and backwards. For example12321and1221are palindromes and123and12451are not. Moreover,1221is zcy number and12321is not.Given integerskandp, calculate the sum of theksmallest zcy numbers and output this sum modulop.Unfortunately, Willem isn't good at solving this kind of problems, so he asks you for help!InputThe first line contains two integerskandp(1 ≤k≤ 105, 1 ≤p≤ 109).OutputOutput single integer — answer to the problem.ExamplesInput2 100Output33Input5 30Output15NoteIn the first example, the smallest zcy number is11, and the second smallest zcy number is22.In the second example,.",
