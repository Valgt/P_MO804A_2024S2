Slime and Sequences (Hard Version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNote that the only differences between easy and hard versions are the constraints on $$$n$$$ and the time limit. You can make hacks only if all versions are solved.Slime is interested in sequences. He definedgoodpositive integer sequences $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ as follows:For each $$$k>1$$$ that presents in $$$p$$$, there should be at least one pair of indices $$$i,j$$$, such that $$$1 \\\\leq i < j \\\\leq n$$$, $$$p_i = k - 1$$$ and $$$p_j = k$$$.For the given integer $$$n$$$, the set of all good sequences of length $$$n$$$ is $$$s_n$$$. For the fixed integer $$$k$$$ and the sequence $$$p$$$, let $$$f_p(k)$$$ be the number of times that $$$k$$$ appears in $$$p$$$. For each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, Slime wants to know the following value:$$$$$$\\\\left(\\\\sum_{p\\\\in s_n} f_p(k)\\\\right)\\\\ \\\\textrm{mod}\\\\ 998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$$$$InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n\\\\ (1\\\\le n\\\\le 100\\\\,000)$$$.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers, the $$$i$$$-th of them should be equal to $$$\\\\left(\\\\sum_{p\\\\in s_n} f_p(i)\\\\right)\\\\ \\\\textrm{mod}\\\\ 998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.ExamplesInput2Output3 1Input3Output10 7 1Input1Output1NoteIn the first example, $$$s=\\\\{[1,1],[1,2]\\\\}$$$.In the second example, $$$s=\\\\{[1,1,1],[1,1,2],[1,2,1],[1,2,2],[2,1,2],[1,2,3]\\\\}$$$.In the third example, $$$s=\\\\{[1]\\\\}$$$.",
