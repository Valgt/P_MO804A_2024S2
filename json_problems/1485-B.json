Replace and Keep Sortedtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven a positive integer $$$k$$$, two arrays are called $$$k$$$-similar if:they arestrictly increasing;they have the same length;all their elements are positive integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$ (inclusive);they differ inexactlyone position.You are given an integer $$$k$$$, astrictly increasingarray $$$a$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries. For each query, you are given two integers $$$l_i \\\\leq r_i$$$. Your task is to find how many arrays $$$b$$$ exist, such that $$$b$$$ is $$$k$$$-similar to array $$$[a_{l_i},a_{l_i+1}\\\\ldots,a_{r_i}]$$$.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq n, q \\\\leq 10^5$$$, $$$n\\\\leq k \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$, the number of queries and number $$$k$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq k$$$). This array is strictly increasing  — $$$a_1 < a_2 < \\\\ldots < a_n$$$.Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq l_i \\\\leq r_i \\\\leq n$$$).OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th of them should contain the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query.ExamplesInput4 2 5 1 2 4 5 2 3 3 4Output4 3Input6 5 10 2 4 6 7 8 9 1 4 1 2 3 5 1 6 5 5Output8 9 7 6 9NoteIn the first example:In the first query there are $$$4$$$ arrays that are $$$5$$$-similar to $$$[2,4]$$$: $$$[1,4],[3,4],[2,3],[2,5]$$$.In the second query there are $$$3$$$ arrays that are $$$5$$$-similar to $$$[4,5]$$$: $$$[1,5],[2,5],[3,5]$$$.",
