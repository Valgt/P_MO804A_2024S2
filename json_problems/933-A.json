On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a1, while one holding it high is represented by a2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequencea1,a2, ...,an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval[l,r](1 ≤l≤r≤n), then reverseal,al+ 1, ...,arso that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indicesp1,p2, ...,pk, such thatp1<p2< ... <pkandap1≤ap2≤ ... ≤apk. The length of the subsequence isk.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line containsnspace-separated integers, describing the original sequencea1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 2,i= 1, 2, ...,n).OutputPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.ExamplesInput41 2 1 2Output4Input101 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1Output9NoteIn the first example, after reversing[2, 3], the array will become[1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is4.In the second example, after reversing[3, 7], the array will become[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is9.",
