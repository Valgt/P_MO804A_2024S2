White, Black and White Againtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutPolycarpus is sure that his life fits the description: \"first there is a white stripe, then a black one, then a white one again\". So, Polycarpus is sure that this rule is going to fulfill during the nextndays. Polycarpus knows that he is in forwgood events andbnot-so-good events. At least one event is going to take place during each day. As each day is unequivocally characterizes as a part of a white or a black stripe, then each day is going to have events of the same type only (ether good or not-so-good).What is the number of distinct ways this scenario can develop over the nextndays if Polycarpus is in for a white stripe (a stripe that has good events only, the stripe's length is at least 1 day), the a black stripe (a stripe that has not-so-good events only, the stripe's length is at least 1 day) and a white stripe again (a stripe that has good events only, the stripe's length is at least 1 day). Each ofndays will belong to one of the three stripes only.Note that even the events of the same type are distinct from each other. Even if some events occur on the same day, they go in some order (there are no simultaneous events).Write a code that prints the number of possible configurations to sort the events into days. See the samples for clarifications on which scenarios should be considered distinct. Print the answer modulo1000000009(109+ 9).InputThe single line of the input contains integersn,wandb(3 ≤n≤ 4000,2 ≤w≤ 4000,1 ≤b≤ 4000) — the number of days, the number of good events and the number of not-so-good events. It is guaranteed thatw+b≥n.OutputPrint the required number of ways modulo1000000009(109+ 9).ExamplesInput3 2 1Output2Input4 2 2Output4Input3 2 2Output4NoteWe'll represent the good events by numbers starting from 1 and the not-so-good events — by letters starting from 'a'. Vertical lines separate days.In the first sample the possible ways are: \"1|a|2\" and \"2|a|1\". In the second sample the possible ways are: \"1|a|b|2\", \"2|a|b|1\", \"1|b|a|2\" and \"2|b|a|1\". In the third sample the possible ways are: \"1|ab|2\", \"2|ab|1\", \"1|ba|2\" and \"2|ba|1\".",
