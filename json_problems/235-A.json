    "statement": "A. LCM Challengetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutSome days ago, I learned the concept of LCM (least common multiple). I've played with it for several times and I want to make a big number with it.But I also don't want to use many numbers, so I'll choose three positive integers (they don't have to be distinct) which are not greater thann. Can you help me to find the maximum possible least common multiple of these three integers?InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 106) — thenmentioned in the statement.OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum possible LCM of three not necessarily distinct positive integers that are not greater thann.ExamplesInput9Output504Input7Output210NoteThe least common multiple of some positive integers is the least positive integer which is multiple for each of them.The result may become very large, 32-bit integer won't be enough. So using 64-bit integers is recommended.For the last example, we can chose numbers7,6,5and the LCM of them is7·6·5 = 210. It is the maximum value we can get.",
