Parsa's Humongous Treetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputParsa has a humongous tree on $$$n$$$ vertices.On each vertex $$$v$$$ he has written two integers $$$l_v$$$ and $$$r_v$$$.To make Parsa's tree look even more majestic, Nima wants to assign a number $$$a_v$$$ ($$$l_v \\\\le a_v \\\\le r_v$$$) to each vertex $$$v$$$ such that the beauty of Parsa's tree is maximized.Nima's sense of the beauty is rather bizarre. He defines the beauty of the tree as the sum of $$$|a_u - a_v|$$$ over all edges $$$(u, v)$$$ of the tree.Since Parsa's tree is too large, Nima can't maximize its beauty on his own. Your task is to find themaximumpossible beauty for Parsa's tree.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1\\\\le t\\\\le 250)$$$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2\\\\le n\\\\le 10^5)$$$ — the number of vertices in Parsa's tree.The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le 10^9)$$$.Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le u , v \\\\le n, u\\\\neq v)$$$ meaning that there is an edge between the vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in Parsa's tree.It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print themaximumpossible beauty for Parsa's tree.ExampleInput3 2 1 6 3 8 1 2 3 1 3 4 6 7 9 1 2 2 3 6 3 14 12 20 12 19 2 12 10 17 3 17 3 2 6 5 1 5 2 6 4 6Output7 8 62NoteThe trees in the example:In the first test case, one possible assignment is $$$a = \\\\{1, 8\\\\}$$$ which results in $$$|1 - 8| = 7$$$.In the second test case, one of the possible assignments is $$$a = \\\\{1, 5, 9\\\\}$$$ which results in a beauty of $$$|1 - 5| + |5 - 9| = 8$$$",
