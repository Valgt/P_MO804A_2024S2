K-divisible Sumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$.You should create an array of $$$n$$$positive integers$$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ such that the sum $$$(a_1 + a_2 + \\\\dots + a_n)$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$ and maximum element in $$$a$$$ is minimum possible.What is the minimum possible maximum element in $$$a$$$?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum possible maximum element in array $$$a$$$ such that the sum $$$(a_1 + \\\\dots + a_n)$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$.ExampleInput4 1 5 4 3 8 8 8 17Output5 2 1 3NoteIn the first test case $$$n = 1$$$, so the array consists of one element $$$a_1$$$ and if we make $$$a_1 = 5$$$ it will be divisible by $$$k = 5$$$ and the minimum possible.In the second test case, we can create array $$$a = [1, 2, 1, 2]$$$. The sum is divisible by $$$k = 3$$$ and the maximum is equal to $$$2$$$.In the third test case, we can create array $$$a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$. The sum is divisible by $$$k = 8$$$ and the maximum is equal to $$$1$$$.",
