Long Pathtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutOne day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of(n+ 1)rooms, numbered from1to(n+ 1). Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the(n+ 1)-th one.The maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room numberi(1 ≤i≤n), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number(i+ 1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room numberpi, where1 ≤pi≤i.In order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows.Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room1.Let's assume that Vasya is in roomiand has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to roompi), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal.Help Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room(n+ 1)in the end.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 103) — the number of rooms. The second line containsnintegerspi(1 ≤pi≤i). Eachpidenotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in thei-th room.OutputPrint a single number — the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo1000000007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput21 2Output4Input41 1 2 3Output20Input51 1 1 1 1Output62",
