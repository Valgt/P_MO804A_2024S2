Array Collapsetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$[p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n]$$$, where all elements are distinct.You can perform several (possibly zero) operations with it. In one operation, you can choose acontiguous subsegmentof $$$p$$$ and removeallelements from that subsegment,except forthe minimum element on that subsegment. For example, if $$$p = [3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 2, 6]$$$ and you choose the subsegment from the $$$3$$$-rd element to the $$$6$$$-th element, the resulting array is $$$[3, 1, 2, 6]$$$.An array $$$a$$$ is calledreachableif it can be obtained from $$$p$$$ using several (maybe zero) aforementioned operations. Calculate the number ofreachablearrays, and print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$distinctintegers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the number ofreachablearrays, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExampleInput322 142 4 1 3510 2 6 3 4Output2 6 12",
