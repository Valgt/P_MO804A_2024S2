    "statement": "B. Moamen and k-subarraystime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMoamen has an array of $$$n$$$distinctintegers. He wants to sort that array in non-decreasing order by doing the following operations in orderexactly once:Split the array into exactly $$$k$$$ non-empty subarrays such that each element belongs to exactly one subarray.Reorder these subarrays arbitrary.Merge the subarrays in their new order.A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subarray of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.Can you tell Moamen if there is a way to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the operations written above?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le |a_i| \\\\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that all numbers aredistinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3\\\\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, you should output a single string.If Moamen can sort the array in non-decreasing order, output \"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise, output \"NO\" (without quotes).You can print each letter of \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (upper or lower).ExampleInput3 5 4 6 3 4 2 1 4 2 1 -4 0 -2 5 1 1 2 3 4 5OutputYes No YesNoteIn the first test case, $$$a = [6, 3, 4, 2, 1]$$$, and $$$k = 4$$$, so we can do the operations as follows:Split $$$a$$$ into $$$\\\\{ [6], [3, 4], [2], [1] \\\\}$$$.Reorder them: $$$\\\\{ [1], [2], [3,4], [6] \\\\}$$$.Merge them: $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]$$$, so now the array is sorted.In the second test case, there is no way to sort the array by splitting it into only $$$2$$$ subarrays.As an example, if we split it into $$$\\\\{ [1, -4], [0, -2] \\\\}$$$, we can reorder them into $$$\\\\{ [1, -4], [0, -2] \\\\}$$$ or $$$\\\\{ [0, -2], [1, -4] \\\\}$$$. However, after merging the subarrays, it is impossible to get a sorted array.",
