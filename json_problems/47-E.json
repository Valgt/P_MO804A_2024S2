The attackers have blocked all the ways out and their cannon is bombarding the city. Fortunately, Berland intelligence managed to intercept the enemies' shooting plan. Let's introduce the Cartesian system of coordinates, the origin of which coincides with the cannon's position, theOxaxis is directed rightwards in the city's direction, theOyaxis is directed upwards (to the sky). The cannon will makenmore shots. The cannon balls' initial speeds are the same in all the shots and are equal toV, so that every shot is characterized by only one numberalphaiwhich represents the angle at which the cannon fires. Due to the cannon's technical peculiarities this angle does not exceed45angles (π / 4). We disregard the cannon sizes and consider the firing made from the point(0, 0).The balls fly according to the known physical laws of a body thrown towards the horizon at an angle:vx(t) =V·cos(alpha)vy(t) =V·sin(alpha)  –g·tx(t) =V·cos(alpha)·ty(t) =V·sin(alpha)·t–g·t2/ 2Think of the acceleration of gravitygas equal to9.8.Bertown defendsmwalls. Thei-th wall is represented as a vertical segment(xi, 0) - (xi,yi). When a ball hits a wall, it gets stuck in it and doesn't fly on. If a ball doesn't hit any wall it falls on the ground (y= 0) and stops. If the ball exactly hits the point(xi,yi), it is considered stuck.Your task is to find for each ball the coordinates of the point where it will be located in the end.InputThe first line contains integersnandV(1 ≤n≤ 104, 1 ≤V≤ 1000) which represent the number of shots and the initial speed of every ball. The second line containsnspace-separated real numbersalphai(0 <alphai< π / 4) which represent the angles in radians at which the cannon will fire. The third line contains integerm(1 ≤m≤ 105) which represents the number of walls. Then followmlines, each containing two real numbersxiandyi(1 ≤xi≤ 1000, 0 ≤yi≤ 1000) which represent the wall’s coordinates. All the real numbers have no more than 4 decimal digits. The walls may partially overlap or even coincide.OutputPrintnlines containing two real numbers each — calculate for every ball the coordinates of its landing point. Your answer should have the relative or absolute error less than10- 4.ExamplesInput2 100.78530.335.0 5.04.0 2.46.0 1.9Output5.000000000 2.5494993694.000000000 0.378324889Input2 100.78530.324.0 2.46.0 1.9Output10.204081436 0.0000000004.000000000 0.378324889",
