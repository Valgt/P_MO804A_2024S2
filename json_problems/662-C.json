Each cell of the table contains either0or1. In one move, you are allowed to pick any row or any column and invert all values, that is, replace0by1and vice versa.What is the minimum number of cells with value 1 you can get after applying some number of operations?InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 20,1 ≤m≤ 100 000) — the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively.Thennlines follows with the descriptions of the rows. Each line has lengthmand contains only digits '0' and '1'.OutputOutput a single integer — the minimum possible number of ones you can get after applying some sequence of operations.ExampleInput3 4011010100111Output2",
