However, he knows that he can't make it on his own so he founded a development company and hirednworkers of staff. Now he wants to picknworkers from the staff who will be directly responsible for developing a game.Each worker has a certain skill levelvi. Besides, each worker doesn't want to work with the one whose skill is very different. In other words, thei-th worker won't work with those whose skill is less thanli, and with those whose skill is more thanri.Pavel understands that the game of his dream isn't too hard to develop, so the worker with any skill will be equally useful. That's why he wants to pick a team of the maximum possible size. Help him pick such team.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 105) — the number of workers Pavel hired.Each of the followingnlines contains three space-separated integersli,vi,ri(1 ≤li≤vi≤ri≤ 3·105) — the minimum skill value of the workers that thei-th worker can work with, thei-th worker's skill and the maximum skill value of the workers that thei-th worker can work with.OutputIn the first line print a single integerm— the number of workers Pavel must pick for developing the game.In the next line printmspace-separated integers — the numbers of the workers in any order.If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput42 8 91 4 73 6 85 8 10Output31 3 4Input63 5 161 6 114 8 127 9 162 10 148 13 15Output41 2 3 5",
