When it was Alice's turn, she told the numbernto Bob and said:—Shuffle the digits in this number in order to obtain the smallest possible number without leading zeroes.—No problem! — said Bob and immediately gave her an answer.Alice said a random number, so she doesn't know whether Bob's answer is correct. Help her to find this out, because impatient brother is waiting for the verdict.InputThe first line contains one integern(0 ≤n≤ 109) without leading zeroes.
