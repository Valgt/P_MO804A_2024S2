Even Oddstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutBeing a nonconformist, Volodya is displeased with the current state of things, particularly with the order of natural numbers (natural number is positive integer number). He is determined to rearrange them. But there are too many natural numbers, so Volodya decided to start with the firstn. He writes down the following sequence of numbers: firstly all odd integers from1ton(in ascending order), then all even integers from1ton(also in ascending order). Help our hero to find out which number will stand at the position numberk.InputThe only line of input contains integersnandk(1 ≤k≤n≤ 1012).Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.OutputPrint the number that will stand at the position numberkafter Volodya's manipulations.ExamplesInput10 3Output5Input7 7Output6NoteIn the first sample Volodya's sequence will look like this: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. The third place in the sequence is therefore occupied by the number 5.",
