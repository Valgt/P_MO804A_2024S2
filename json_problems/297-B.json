    "statement": "B. Fish Weighttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutIt is known that there arekfish species in the polar ocean, numbered from1tok. They are sorted by non-decreasing order of their weight, which is a positive number. Let the weight of thei-th type of fish bewi, then0 <w1≤w2≤ ... ≤wkholds.Polar bears Alice and Bob each have caught some fish, and they are guessing who has the larger sum of weight of the fish he/she's caught. Given the type of the fish they've caught, determine whether it is possible that the fish caught by Alice has astrictly largertotal weight than Bob's. In other words, does there exist a sequence of weightswi(not necessary integers), such that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger total weight?InputThe first line contains three integersn,m,k(1 ≤n,m≤ 105, 1 ≤k≤ 109)— the number of fish caught by Alice and Bob respectively, and the number of fish species.The second line containsnintegers each from 1 tok, the list of fish type caught by Alice. The third line containsmintegers each from 1 tok, the list of fish type caught by Bob.Note that one may have caught more than one fish for a same species.OutputOutput \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.ExamplesInput3 3 32 2 21 1 3OutputYESInput4 7 95 2 7 33 5 2 7 3 8 7OutputNONoteIn the first sample, ifw1= 1,w2= 2,w3= 2.5,  then Alice has a total of2 + 2 + 2 = 6weight units, while Bob only has1 + 1 + 2.5 = 4.5.In the second sample, the fish that Alice caught is a subset of Bob's. Therefore, the total weight of Bob’s fish is always not less than the total weight of Alice’s fish.",
