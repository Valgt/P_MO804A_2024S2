AB-stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe string $$$t_1t_2 \\\\dots t_k$$$ is good if each letter of this string belongs to at least one palindrome of lengthgreaterthan1.A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, the stringsA,BAB,ABBA,BAABBBAABare palindromes, but the stringsAB,ABBBAA,BBBAare not.Here are some examples of good strings:$$$t$$$ =AABBB(letters $$$t_1$$$, $$$t_2$$$ belong to palindrome $$$t_1 \\\\dots t_2$$$ and letters $$$t_3$$$, $$$t_4$$$, $$$t_5$$$ belong to palindrome $$$t_3 \\\\dots t_5$$$);$$$t$$$ =ABAA(letters $$$t_1$$$, $$$t_2$$$, $$$t_3$$$ belong to palindrome $$$t_1 \\\\dots t_3$$$ and letter $$$t_4$$$ belongs to palindrome $$$t_3 \\\\dots t_4$$$);$$$t$$$ =AAAAA(all letters belong to palindrome $$$t_1 \\\\dots t_5$$$);You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting ofonlylettersAandB.You have to calculate the number of good substrings of string $$$s$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of lettersAandB.OutputPrint one integer — the number of good substrings of string $$$s$$$.ExamplesInput5 AABBBOutput6Input3 AAAOutput3Input7 AAABABBOutput15NoteIn the first test case there are six good substrings: $$$s_1 \\\\dots s_2$$$, $$$s_1 \\\\dots s_4$$$, $$$s_1 \\\\dots s_5$$$, $$$s_3 \\\\dots s_4$$$, $$$s_3 \\\\dots s_5$$$ and $$$s_4 \\\\dots s_5$$$.In the second test case there are three good substrings: $$$s_1 \\\\dots s_2$$$, $$$s_1 \\\\dots s_3$$$ and $$$s_2 \\\\dots s_3$$$.",
