Let's definepalindrome degreeof arrayaas the number of such index pairs(l,r)(1 ≤l≤r≤n), that the elements from thel-th to ther-th one inclusive can be rearranged in such a way that thewholearray will be a palindrome. In other words, pair(l,r)should meet the condition that after some rearranging of numbers on positions fromltor, inclusive (it is allowed not to rearrange the numbers at all), for any1 ≤i≤nfollowing condition holds:a[i] =a[n-i+ 1].Your task is to find thepalindrome degreeof Misha's array.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105).The second line containsnpositive integersa[i](1 ≤a[i] ≤n), separated by spaces — the elements of Misha's array.OutputIn a single line print the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput32 2 2Output6Input63 6 5 3 3 5Output0Input55 5 2 5 2Output4NoteIn the first sample test any possible pair(l,r)meets the condition.In the third sample test following pairs(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)meet the condition.",
