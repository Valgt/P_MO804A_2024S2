Two Shuffled Sequencestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTwo integer sequences existed initially — one of them wasstrictlyincreasing, and the other one —strictlydecreasing.Strictly increasing sequence is a sequence of integers $$$[x_1 < x_2 < \\\\dots < x_k]$$$. And strictly decreasing sequence is a sequence of integers $$$[y_1 > y_2 > \\\\dots > y_l]$$$. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.They were merged into one sequence $$$a$$$. After that sequence $$$a$$$ got shuffled. For example, some of the possible resulting sequences $$$a$$$ for an increasing sequence $$$[1, 3, 4]$$$ and a decreasing sequence $$$[10, 4, 2]$$$ are sequences $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 10]$$$ or $$$[4, 2, 1, 10, 4, 3]$$$.This shuffled sequence $$$a$$$ is given in the input.Your task is to findanytwo suitable initial sequences. One of them should bestrictlyincreasing and the other one —strictlydecreasing. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.If there is a contradiction in the input and it is impossible to split the given sequence $$$a$$$ to increasing and decreasing sequences, print \"NO\".InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.OutputIf there is a contradiction in the input and it is impossible to split the given sequence $$$a$$$ to increasing and decreasing sequences, print \"NO\" in the first line.Otherwise print \"YES\" in the first line andanytwo suitable sequences. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.In the second line print $$$n_i$$$ — the number of elements in thestrictly increasingsequence. $$$n_i$$$ can be zero, in this case the increasing sequence is empty.In the third line print $$$n_i$$$ integers $$$inc_1, inc_2, \\\\dots, inc_{n_i}$$$ in theincreasingorder of its values ($$$inc_1 < inc_2 < \\\\dots < inc_{n_i}$$$) — thestrictly increasingsequence itself. You can keep this line empty if $$$n_i = 0$$$ (or just print the empty line).In the fourth line print $$$n_d$$$ — the number of elements in thestrictly decreasingsequence. $$$n_d$$$ can be zero, in this case the decreasing sequence is empty.In the fifth line print $$$n_d$$$ integers $$$dec_1, dec_2, \\\\dots, dec_{n_d}$$$ in thedecreasingorder of its values ($$$dec_1 > dec_2 > \\\\dots > dec_{n_d}$$$) — thestrictly decreasingsequence itself. You can keep this line empty if $$$n_d = 0$$$ (or just print the empty line).$$$n_i + n_d$$$ should be equal to $$$n$$$ and the union of printed sequences should be a permutation of the given sequence (in case of \"YES\" answer).ExamplesInput7 7 2 7 3 3 1 4OutputYES 2 3 7  5 7 4 3 2 1Input5 4 3 1 5 3OutputYES 1 3  4 5 4 3 1Input5 1 1 2 1 2OutputNOInput5 0 1 2 3 4OutputYES 0  5 4 3 2 1 0",
