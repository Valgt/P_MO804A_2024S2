Set of Pointstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutConvexity of a set of points on the plane is the size of the largest subset of points that form a convex polygon. Your task is to build a set ofnpoints with the convexity of exactlym. Your set of points should not contain three points that lie on a straight line.InputThe single line contains two integersnandm(3 ≤m≤ 100,m≤n≤ 2m).OutputIf there is no solution, print \"-1\". Otherwise, printnpairs of integers — the coordinates of points of any set with the convexity ofm.
