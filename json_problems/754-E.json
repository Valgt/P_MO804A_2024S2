Dasha and cyclic tabletime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDasha is fond of challenging puzzles: Rubik's Cube3 × 3 × 3,4 × 4 × 4,5 × 5 × 5and so on. This time she has a cyclic table of sizen×m, and each cell of the table contains a lowercase English letter. Each cell has coordinates(i,j)(0 ≤i<n,0 ≤j<m). The table is cyclic means that to the right of cell(i,j)there is the cell, and to the down there is the cell.Dasha has a pattern as well. A pattern is a non-cyclic table of sizer×c. Each cell is either a lowercase English letter or a question mark. Each cell has coordinates(i,j)(0 ≤i<r,0 ≤j<c).The goal of the puzzle is to find all the appearance positions of the pattern in the cyclic table.We say that the cell(i,j)of cyclic table is an appearance position, if for every pair(x,y)such that0 ≤x<rand0 ≤y<cone of the following conditions holds:There is a question mark in the cell(x,y)of the pattern, orThe cellof the cyclic table equals to the cell(x,y)of the pattern.Dasha solved this puzzle in no time, as well as all the others she ever tried. Can you solve it?.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 400) — the cyclic table sizes.Each of the nextnlines contains a string ofmlowercase English characters — the description of the cyclic table.The next line contains two integersrandc(1 ≤r,c≤ 400) — the sizes of the pattern.Each of the nextrlines contains a string ofclowercase English letter and/or characters '?' — the description of the pattern.OutputPrintnlines. Each of thenlines should containmcharacters. Each of the characters should equal '0' or '1'.Thej-th character of thei-th (0-indexed) line should be equal to '1', in case the cell(i,j)is an appearance position, otherwise it should be equal to '0'.ExamplesInput5 7qcezchshhedywqwikywqyqckrqztbqexcxz3 2??yw?qOutput00001000001001000000000000000000000Input10 10fwtoayylhwyyaryyjawrywrdzwhscyhnsyyxiphnbnjwzyyjvokkjgseenwngvmiflpcsylxvkwrobwuwyybbcocyyyysijsvqry2 2??yyOutput1000100000000000000100010000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000010000001010000000010000010000Input8 6ibrgxlxqdcsgokbcgitvpetcxgxxigigghzolmlazagpswzv1 4gx??Output000100000001000000000000010001000000000000000000",
