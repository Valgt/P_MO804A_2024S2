All points are different.Find the number of different groups of three points(A,B,C)such that pointBis the middle of segmentAC.The groups of three points are considered unordered, that is, if pointBis the middle of segmentAC, then groups(A,B,C)and(C,B,A)are considered the same.InputThe first line contains a single integern(3 ≤n≤ 3000) — the number of points.Nextnlines contain the points. Thei-th line contains coordinates of thei-th point: two space-separated integersxi,yi(- 1000 ≤xi,yi≤ 1000).It is guaranteed that all given points are different.OutputPrint the single number — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput31 12 23 3Output1Input30 0-1 00 1Output0",
