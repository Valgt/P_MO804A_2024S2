A Serial Killertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOur beloved detective, Sherlock is currently trying to catch a serial killer who kills a person each day. Using his powers of deduction, he came to know that the killer has a strategy for selecting his next victim.The killer starts with two potential victims on his first day, selects one of these two, kills selected victim and replaces him with a new person. He repeats this procedure each day. This way, each day he has two potential victims to choose from. Sherlock knows the initial two potential victims. Also, he knows the murder that happened on a particular day and the new person who replaced this victim.You need to help him get all the pairs of potential victims at each day so that Sherlock can observe some pattern.InputFirst line of input contains two names (length of each of them doesn't exceed10), the two initials potential victims. Next line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 1000), the number of days.Nextnlines contains two names (length of each of them doesn't exceed10), first being the person murdered on this day and the second being the one who replaced that person.The input format is consistent, that is, a person murdered is guaranteed to be from the two potential victims at that time.
