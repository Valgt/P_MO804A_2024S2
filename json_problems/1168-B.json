A binary string consists only of zeros and ones.Let $$$n$$$ be the length of $$$s$$$.Rash needs to find the number of such pairs of integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ that $$$1 \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq n$$$ and there is at least one pair of integers $$$x$$$, $$$k$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\leq x, k \\\\leq n$$$, $$$l \\\\leq x < x + 2k \\\\leq r$$$, and $$$s_x = s_{x+k} = s_{x+2k}$$$.Find this number of pairs for Rash.InputThe first line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq |s| \\\\leq 300\\\\,000$$$), consisting of zeros and ones.OutputOutput one integer: the number of such pairs of integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ that $$$1 \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq n$$$ and there is at least one pair of integers $$$x$$$, $$$k$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\leq x, k \\\\leq n$$$, $$$l \\\\leq x < x + 2k \\\\leq r$$$, and $$$s_x = s_{x+k} = s_{x+2k}$$$.ExamplesInput010101Output3Input11001100Output0NoteIn the first example, there are three $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ pairs we need to count: $$$1$$$, $$$6$$$; $$$2$$$, $$$6$$$; and $$$1$$$, $$$5$$$.In the second example, there are no values $$$x$$$, $$$k$$$ for the initial string, so the answer is $$$0$$$.",
