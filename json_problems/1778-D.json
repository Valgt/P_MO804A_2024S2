Flexible String Revisittime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two binary strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. In each move, the string $$$a$$$ is modified in the following way.An index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$) is chosen uniformly at random. The character $$$a_i$$$ will be flipped. That is, if $$$a_i$$$ is $$$0$$$, it becomes $$$1$$$, and if $$$a_i$$$ is $$$1$$$, it becomes $$$0$$$.What is the expected number of moves required to make both strings equalfor the first time?A binary string is a string, in which the character is either $$$\\\\tt{0}$$$ or $$$\\\\tt{1}$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^6$$$) — the length of the strings.The second line of each test case contains the binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.The third line of each test case contains the binary string $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing the expected number of moves modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.Formally, let $$$M = 998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\\\not \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\\\cdot q^{-1} \\\\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\\\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\\\cdot q \\\\equiv p \\\\pmod{M}$$$.ExampleInput41012000041000111050100110111Output1 0 665496254 665496277NoteIn the first test case, index $$$1$$$ is chosen randomly and $$$a_1$$$ is flipped. After the move, the strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are equal. The expected number of moves is $$$1$$$.The strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are already equal in the second test case. So, the expected number of moves is $$$0$$$.The expected number of moves for the third and fourth test cases are $$$\\\\frac{56}{3}$$$ and $$$\\\\frac{125}{3}$$$ respectively.",
