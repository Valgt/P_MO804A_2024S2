Cardiogramtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutIn this problem, your task is to use ASCII graphics to paint a cardiogram.A cardiogram is a polyline with the following corners:That is, a cardiogram is fully defined by a sequence of positive integersa1,a2, ...,an.Your task is to paint a cardiogram by given sequenceai.InputThe first line contains integern(2 ≤n≤ 1000). The next line contains the sequence of integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that the sum of allaidoesn't exceed1000.OutputPrintmax|yi-yj|lines (whereykis theycoordinate of thek-th point of the polyline), in each line printcharacters. Each character must equal either «/» (slash), «\\\\» (backslash), «» (space). The printed image must be the image of the given polyline. Please study the test samples for better understanding of how to print a cardiogram.Notethat in this problem the checker checks your answer taking spaces into consideration. Do not print any extra characters. Remember that the wrong answer to the first pretest doesn't give you a penalty.ExamplesInput53 1 2 5 1Output/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\\\\\/Input31 5 1Output/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/NoteDue to the technical reasons the answers for the samples cannot be copied from the statement.
