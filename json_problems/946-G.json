You are allowed to replace any element with any integer number (and you may do so any number of times you need). What is the minimum number of replacements you have to perform in order to make the arrayalmost increasing?InputThe first line contains one integern(2 ≤n≤ 200000) — the number of elements ina.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — the arraya.OutputPrint the minimum number of replaces you have to perform so thataisalmost increasing.ExamplesInput55 4 3 2 1Output3Input51 2 8 9 5Output0",
