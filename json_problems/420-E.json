Sometimes it is a good idea to rise from the desk, have a rest, have small talk with colleagues and even play. The coders of the F company have their favorite ball game.Let's imagine the game on the plane with a cartesian coordinate system. The point (0, 0) contains the player who chooses an arbitrary direction and throws a ball in that direction. The ball hits the plane at distancedfrom the player's original position and continues flying in the same direction. After the ball hits the plane for the first time, it flies on and hits the plane again at distance2·dfrom the player's original position and so on (it continue flying in the chosen direction and hitting the plane after eachdunits). All coders in the F company are strong, so the ball flies infinitely far away.The plane hasncircles painted on it. If a ball hits the plane and hits a circle that is painted on the plane (including its border), then the player gets one point. The ball can hit multiple circles at once and get one point for each of them (if the ball hits some circlextimes during the move, the player also getsxpoints). Count the maximum number of points a player can get if he throws a ball in the arbitrary direction. Note that the direction may have real cooridinates.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers —nиd(1 ≤n≤ 2·104; 5 ≤d≤ 10). Nextnlines contain the circles' description. Thei-th line contains three space-separated integersxi,yi,ri( - 10000 ≤xi,yi≤ 10000; 1 ≤r≤ 50), where(xi,yi,ri)are the coordinates of the center and the radius of the circle, correspondingly. The point (0, 0) is not inside or on the border of some circle.OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum number of points you can get.ExamplesInput2 51 1 15 0 1Output1Input2 54 0 35 3 1Output2Input1 1020 0 10Output3",
