The sound was described by the string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin characters. Now you want to find out if the sound was a cat meowing.For the sound to be a meowing, the string can only contain the letters 'm', 'e', 'o' and 'w', in either uppercase or lowercase. Also:string must start with non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'm' or 'M'it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'e' or 'E'it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'o' or 'O'it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'w' or 'W', this sequence ends the string, after it immediately comes the string endFor example, strings \"meow\", \"mmmEeOWww\", \"MeOooOw\" describe a meowing, but strings \"Mweo\", \"MeO\", \"moew\", \"MmEW\", \"meowmeow\" do not.Determine whether the sound you heard was a cat meowing or something else.InputThe first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$) — the length of the string describing the sound.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters. The string describes the sound you heard and consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.OutputFor each test case, output on a separate line:YESif the sound was a cat meowing;NOotherwise.You can outputYESandNOin any case (for example, stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill be recognized as positive response).ExampleInput74meOw14mMmeoOoWWWwwwW3mew7MmeEeUw4MEOW6MmyaVW5meowAOutputYES YES NO NO YES NO NONoteIn the first test case, the string consists of a sequence of characters 'm', 'e', 'O', 'w', which satisfies the definition of meowing.In the second test case, the string consists of a sequence of $$$3$$$ characters 'm' and 'M', one 'e', a sequence of $$$3$$$ characters 'o' and 'O' and a sequence of $$$7$$$ characters 'w' and 'W', which satisfies the definition of meowing.In the third test case, the string does not describe a meowing because it lacks a sequence of 'o' or 'O' characters between 'e' and 'w'.In the fourth test case, the string contains the character 'U', so it does not describe a meowing.",
