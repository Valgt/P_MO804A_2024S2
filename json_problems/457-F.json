They have a rooted binary tree, that has a property that each node is either a leaf or has exactly two children. Each leaf has a number associated with it.On his/her turn a player can choose any two leafs that share their immediate parent, remove them, and associate either of their values with their parent, that now became a leaf (the player decides which of the two values to associate). The game ends when only one node (the one that was the root of the tree) is left.Pieguy goes first, and his goal is to maximize the value that will be associated with the root when the game ends. Piegirl wants to minimize that value. Assuming that both players are playing optimally, what number will be associated with the root when the game ends?InputFirst line contains a single integert(1 ≤t≤ 100) — number of test cases. Thenttest cases follow. Each test case begins with an empty line, followed by a line with a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 250), followed bynlines describingnnodes of the tree. Each of thosenlines either contains a non-negative numberai, indicating a leaf node with valueai(0 ≤ai≤ 1000) associated with it, or- 1followed by integerslandr, indicating a non-leaf node with childrenlandr(0 ≤l,r≤n- 1). Nodes are numbered from0ton- 1. The root is always node0.OutputFor each test case print one line with one integer on it — the number that will be associated with the root when the game ends.ExamplesInput43-1 1 21055-1 1 2-1 3 4105207-1 1 2-1 3 4-1 5 6123411-1 1 2-1 3 4-1 5 6-1 7 8157-1 9 1078911Output101048",
