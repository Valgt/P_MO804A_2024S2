Find the length of the shortest cycle which starts from the vertex 1 and passes throught all the edges at least once. Graph may contain multiply edges between a pair of vertices and loops (edges from the vertex to itself).InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 15, 0 ≤m≤ 2000),nis the amount of vertices, andmis the amount of edges.
