Each character of a binary string is either a0or a1. We will also deal with substrings; recall that a substring is a contiguous subsequence of a string. We denote the substring of string $$$s$$$ starting from the $$$l$$$-th character and ending with the $$$r$$$-th character as $$$s[l \\\\dots r]$$$. The characters of each string are numbered from $$$1$$$.We can perform several operations on the strings we consider. Each operation is to choose a substring of our string and replace it with another string. There are two possible types of operations: replace011with110, or replace110with011. For example, if we apply exactly one operation to the string110011110, it can be transformed into011011110,110110110, or110011011.Binary string $$$a$$$ is consideredreachablefrom binary string $$$b$$$ if there exists a sequence $$$s_1$$$, $$$s_2$$$, ..., $$$s_k$$$ such that $$$s_1 = a$$$, $$$s_k = b$$$, and for every $$$i \\\\in [1, k - 1]$$$, $$$s_i$$$ can be transformed into $$$s_{i + 1}$$$ using exactly one operation. Note that $$$k$$$ can be equal to $$$1$$$, i. e.,every string is reachable from itself.You are given a string $$$t$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries to it. Each query consists of three integers $$$l_1$$$, $$$l_2$$$ and $$$len$$$. To answer each query, you have to determine whether $$$t[l_1 \\\\dots l_1 + len - 1]$$$ is reachable from $$$t[l_2 \\\\dots l_2 + len - 1]$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of string $$$t$$$.The second line contains one string $$$t$$$ ($$$|t| = n$$$). Each character of $$$t$$$ is either0or1.The third line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, each line represents a query. The $$$i$$$-th line contains three integers $$$l_1$$$, $$$l_2$$$ and $$$len$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_1, l_2 \\\\le |t|$$$, $$$1 \\\\le len \\\\le |t| - \\\\max(l_1, l_2) + 1$$$) for the $$$i$$$-th query.OutputFor each query, print eitherYESif $$$t[l_1 \\\\dots l_1 + len - 1]$$$ is reachable from $$$t[l_2 \\\\dots l_2 + len - 1]$$$, orNOotherwise. You may print each letter in any register.ExampleInput5 11011 3 1 3 3 1 4 2 1 2 3OutputYes Yes No",
