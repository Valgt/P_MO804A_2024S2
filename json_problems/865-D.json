Buy Low Sell Hightime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou can perfectly predict the price of a certain stock for the nextNdays. You would like to profit on this knowledge, but only want to transact one share of stock per day. That is, each day you will either buy one share, sell one share, or do nothing. Initially you own zero shares, and you cannot sell shares when you don't own any. At the end of theNdays you would like to again own zero shares, but want to have as much money as possible.InputInput begins with an integerN(2 ≤N≤ 3·105), the number of days.Following this is a line with exactlyNintegersp1,p2, ...,pN(1 ≤pi≤ 106). The price of one share of stock on thei-th day is given bypi.OutputPrint the maximum amount of money you can end up with at the end ofNdays.ExamplesInput910 5 4 7 9 12 6 2 10Output20Input203 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9 7 9 3 2 3 8 4Output41NoteIn the first example, buy a share at5, buy another at4, sell one at9and another at12. Then buy at2and sell at10. The total profit is- 5 - 4 + 9 + 12 - 2 + 10 = 20.",
