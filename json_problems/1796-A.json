Initially, it is empty. We go through all positive integers, starting from $$$1$$$, in ascending order, and do the following for each integer:if the current integer is divisible by $$$3$$$, appendFto the end of the FB-string;if the current integer is divisible by $$$5$$$, appendBto the end of the FB-string.Note that if an integer is divisible by both $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$, we appendF, and thenB, not in the opposite order.The first $$$10$$$ characters of the FB-string areFBFFBFFBFB: the firstFcomes from the integer $$$3$$$, the next character (B) comes from $$$5$$$, the nextFcomes from the integer $$$6$$$, and so on. It's easy to see that this string is infinitely long. Let $$$f_i$$$ be the $$$i$$$-th character of FB-string; so, $$$f_1$$$ isF, $$$f_2$$$ isB, $$$f_3$$$ isF, $$$f_4$$$ isF, and so on.You are given a string $$$s$$$, consisting of charactersFand/orB. You have to determine whether it is a substring (contiguous subsequence) of the FB-string. In other words, determine if it is possible to choose two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r$$$) so that the string $$$f_l f_{l+1} f_{l+2} \\\\dots f_r$$$ is exactly $$$s$$$.For example:FFBis a substring of the FB-string: if we pick $$$l = 3$$$ and $$$r = 5$$$, the string $$$f_3 f_4 f_5$$$ is exactlyFFB;BFFBFFBFis a substring of the FB-string: if we pick $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 9$$$, the string $$$f_2 f_3 f_4 \\\\dots f_9$$$ is exactlyBFFBFFBF;BBBis not a substring of the FB-string.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2046$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10$$$) — the number of characters in $$$s$$$. The second line contains $$$s$$$, which is a string of exactly $$$k$$$ characters. Each character of $$$s$$$ is eitherForB.OutputFor each test case, printYESif $$$s$$$ is a substring of the FB-string, orNOotherwise.You may print each letter in any case (YES,yes,Yeswill all be recognized as positive answer,NO,noandnOwill all be recognized as negative answer).ExampleInput33FFB8BFFBFFBF3BBBOutputYES YES NO",
