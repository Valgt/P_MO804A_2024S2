The tanks in this game keep trying to finish each other off. But your \"Pedalny\" is not like that... He just needs to drive in a straight line from pointAto point B on the plane. Unfortunately, on the same plane arenenemy tanks. We shall regard all the tanks as points. At the initial moment of time Pedalny is at the pointA. Enemy tanks would be happy to destroy it immediately, but initially their turrets are tuned in other directions. Specifically, for each tank we know the initial rotation of the turretai(the angle in radians relative to theOXaxis in the counterclockwise direction) and the maximum speed of rotation of the turretwi(radians per second). If at any point of time a tank turret will be aimed precisely at the tank Pedalny, then the enemy fires and it never misses. Pedalny can endure no more thankshots. Gun reloading takes very much time, so we can assume that every enemy will produce no more than one shot. Your task is to determine what minimum speed ofvPedalny must have to get to the pointB. It is believed that Pedalny is able to instantly develop the speed ofv, and the firstkshots at him do not reduce the speed and do not change the coordinates of the tank.InputThe first line contains 4 numbers – the coordinates of pointsAandB(in meters), the points do not coincide. On the second line numbernis given (1 ≤n≤ 104). It is the number of enemy tanks. Each of the followingnlines contain the coordinates of a corresponding tankxi,yiand its parametersaiandwi(0 ≤ai≤ 2π,0 ≤wi≤ 100). Numbersaiandwicontain at most 5 digits after the decimal point. All coordinates are integers and their absolute values do not exceed105. Enemy tanks can rotate a turret in the clockwise as well as in the counterclockwise direction at the angular speed of not more thanwi. It is guaranteed that each of the enemy tanks will need at least0.1seconds to aim at any point of the segmentABand each of the enemy tanks is posistioned no closer than0.1meters to lineAB. On the last line is given the numberk(0 ≤k≤n).OutputPrint a single number with absolute or relative error no more than10- 4— the minimum required speed of Pedalny in meters per second.ExamplesInput0 0 10 015 -5 4.71238 10Output4.2441Input0 0 10 015 -5 4.71238 11Output0.0000",
