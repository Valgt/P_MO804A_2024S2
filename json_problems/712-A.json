For allifrom1ton, valuesaiare defined by the crows performing the following procedure:The crow setsaiinitially0.The crow then addsbitoai, subtractsbi+ 1, adds thebi+ 2number, and so on until then'th number. Thus,ai=bi-bi+ 1+bi+ 2-bi+ 3....Memory gives you the valuesa1,a2, ...,an, and he now wants you to find the initial numbersb1,b2, ...,bnwritten in the row? Can you do it?InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 100 000) — the number of integers written in the row.The next line containsn, thei'th of which isai(- 109≤ai≤ 109) — the value of thei'th number.OutputPrintnintegers corresponding to the sequenceb1,b2, ...,bn. It's guaranteed that the answer is unique and fits in 32-bit integer type.ExamplesInput56 -4 8 -2 3Output2 4 6 1 3Input53 -2 -1 5 6Output1 -3 4 11 6NoteIn the first sample test, the crows report the numbers6,- 4,8,- 2, and3when he starts at indices1,2,3,4and5respectively. It is easy to check that the sequence24613satisfies the reports. For example,6 = 2 - 4 + 6 - 1 + 3, and- 4 = 4 - 6 + 1 - 3.In the second sample test, the sequence1,- 3,4,11,6satisfies the reports. For example,5 = 11 - 6and6 = 6.",
