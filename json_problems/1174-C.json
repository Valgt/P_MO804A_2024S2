For every integer $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$n$$$, assign a positive integer $$$a_i$$$ such that the following conditions hold:For any pair of integers $$$(i,j)$$$, if $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are coprime, $$$a_i \\\\neq a_j$$$.The maximal value of all $$$a_i$$$ should be minimized (that is, as small as possible).A pair of integers is calledcoprimeif theirgreatest common divisoris $$$1$$$.InputThe only line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$).OutputPrint $$$n-1$$$ integers, $$$a_2$$$, $$$a_3$$$, $$$\\\\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq n$$$).If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput4Output1 2 1Input3Output2 1NoteIn the first example, notice that $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ are coprime, so $$$a_3 \\\\neq a_4$$$. Also, notice that $$$a=[1,2,3]$$$ satisfies the first condition, but it's not a correct answer because its maximal value is $$$3$$$.",
