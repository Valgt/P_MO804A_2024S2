She has arraya1,a2, ...,an, consisting ofnpositive integers.Her university teacher gave her a task. Find such number in the array, that all array elements are divisible by it. Help her and find the number!InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105), showing how many numbers the array has. The next line contains integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109)— the array elements.OutputPrint a single integer — the number from the array, such that all array elements are divisible by it. If such number doesn't exist, print-1.If there are multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput32 2 4Output2Input52 1 3 1 6Output1Input32 3 5Output-1",
