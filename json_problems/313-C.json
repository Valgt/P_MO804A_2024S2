Of all mathematical objects, his favourite one is matrices. Now he's faced a complicated matrix problem he needs to solve.He's got a square2n× 2n-sized matrix and4nintegers. You need to arrange all these numbers in the matrix (put each number in a single individual cell) so that thebeautyof the resulting matrix with numbers is maximum.Thebeautyof a2n× 2n-sized matrix is an integer, obtained by the following algorithm:Find the maximum element in the matrix. Let's denote it asm.Ifn= 0, then the beauty of the matrix equalsm. Otherwise, a matrix can be split into 4 non-intersecting2n- 1× 2n- 1-sized submatrices, then the beauty of the matrix equals the sum of numbermand other four beauties of the described submatrices.As you can see, the algorithm is recursive.Help Ilya, solve the problem and print the resulting maximum beauty of the matrix.InputThe first line contains integer4n(1 ≤ 4n≤ 2·106). The next line contains4nintegersai(1 ≤ai≤ 109)— the numbers you need to arrange in the2n× 2n-sized matrix.OutputOn a single line print the maximum value of the beauty of the described matrix.Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.ExamplesInput113Output13Input41 2 3 4Output14NoteConsider the second sample. You need to arrange the numbers in the matrix as follows:1 23 4Then the beauty of the matrix will equal: 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 14.",
