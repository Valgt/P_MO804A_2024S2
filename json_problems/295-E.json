The coordinate of the first point isx1, the coordinate of the second point isx2, ..., the coordinate of then-th point is —xn. Now Yaroslav wants to executemqueries, each of them is of one of the two following types:Move thepj-th point from positionxpjto positionxpj+dj. At that, it is guaranteed that after executing such query all coordinates of the points will be distinct.Count the sum of distances between all pairs of points that lie on the segment[lj,rj](lj≤rj). In other words, you should count the sum of:.Help Yaroslav.InputThe first line contains integern— the number of points(1 ≤n≤ 105). The second line contains distinct integersx1,x2, ...,xn— the coordinates of points(|xi| ≤ 109).The third line contains integerm— the number of queries(1 ≤m≤ 105). The nextmlines contain the queries. Thej-th line first contains integertj(1 ≤tj≤ 2)— the query type. Iftj= 1, then it is followed by two integerspjanddj(1 ≤pj≤n, |dj| ≤ 1000). Iftj= 2, then it is followed by two integersljandrj( - 109≤lj≤rj≤ 109).It is guaranteed that at any moment all the points have distinct coordinates.OutputFor each type 2 query print the answer on a single line. Print the answers in the order, in which the queries follow in the input.Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers inC++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams of the%I64dspecifier.ExamplesInput836 50 28 -75 40 -60 -95 -48202 -61 291 5 -531 1 4291 5 1302 -101 -712 -69 531 1 4041 5 5182 -101 532 50 8721 1 -2072 -99 -401 7 -3891 6 -1711 2 4641 7 -7071 1 -7301 1 5602 635 6441 7 -677Output17620406104616381560",
