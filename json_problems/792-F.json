Vova's character is a mage. Though as he has just started, his character knows no spells.Vova's character can learn new spells during the game. Every spell is characterized by two valuesxiandyi— damage per second and mana cost per second, respectively. Vova doesn't have to use a spell for an integer amount of seconds. More formally, if he uses a spell with damagexand mana costyforzseconds, then he will dealx·zdamage and spendy·zmana (no rounding). If there is no mana left (mana amount is set in the start of the game and it remains the same at the beginning of every fight), then character won't be able to use any spells. It is prohibited to use multiple spells simultaneously.Also Vova can fight monsters. Every monster is characterized by two valuestjandhj— monster kills Vova's character intjseconds and hashjhealth points. Mana refills after every fight (or Vova's character revives with full mana reserve), so previous fights have no influence on further ones.Vova's character kills a monster, if he dealshjdamage to it in no more thantjseconds using his spells (it is allowed to use more than one spell in a fight) and spending no more mana than he had at the beginning of the fight.If monster's health becomes zero exactly intjseconds (it means that the monster and Vova's character kill each other at the same time), then Vova wins the fight.You have to write a program which can answer two types of queries:1xy— Vova's character learns new spell which dealsxdamage per second and costsymana per second.2th— Vova fights the monster which kills his character intseconds and hashhealth points.Note that queries are given in a different form. Also remember that Vova's character knows no spells at the beginning of the game.For every query of second type you have to determine if Vova is able to win the fight with corresponding monster.InputThe first line contains two integer numbersqandm(2 ≤q≤ 105, 1 ≤m≤ 1012)— the number of queries and the amount of mana at the beginning of every fight.i-th of each nextqlines contains three numberski,aiandbi(1 ≤ki≤ 2, 1 ≤ai,bi≤ 106).Using them you can restore queries this way: letjbe the index of the last query of second type with positive answer (j= 0if there were none of these).Ifki= 1, then character learns spell withx= (ai+j)mod106+ 1,y= (bi+j)mod106+ 1.Ifki= 2, then you have to determine if Vova is able to win the fight against monster witht= (ai+j)mod106+ 1,h= (bi+j)mod106+ 1.OutputFor every query of second type printYESif Vova is able to win the fight with corresponding monster andNOotherwise.ExampleInput3 1001 4 92 19 492 19 49OutputYESNONoteIn first example Vova's character at first learns the spell with5damage and10mana cost per second. Next query is a fight with monster which can kill character in20seconds and has50health points. Vova kills it in10seconds (spending100mana). Next monster has52health, so Vova can't deal that much damage with only100mana.",
