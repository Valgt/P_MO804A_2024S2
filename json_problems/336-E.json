Besides, he's gotkjars with different water color paints. All jars are numbered in some manner from1tok, inclusive. The jar numbericontains the paint of thei-th color.Initially the bear took a pencil and drew four segments on the coordinate plane. All of them end at point(0, 0). They begin at:(0, 2n),(0,  - 2n),(2n, 0),( - 2n, 0). Then for eachi= 1, 2, ...,n, the bear drew two squares. The first square has the following vertex coordinates:(2i, 0),( - 2i, 0),(0,  - 2i),(0, 2i). The second square has the following vertex coordinates:( - 2i- 1,  - 2i- 1),( - 2i- 1, 2i- 1),(2i- 1,  - 2i- 1),(2i- 1, 2i- 1). After that, the bear drew another square:(1, 0),( - 1, 0),(0,  - 1),(0, 1). All points mentioned above form the set of pointsA.The sample of the final picture atn= 0The sample of the final picture atn= 2The bear decided to paint the resulting picture inkmoves. Thei-th move consists of the following stages:The bear chooses 3 distinct points in setАso that any pair of the chosen points has a segment on the picture between them. The chosen points and segments mark the area that mustn't contain any previously painted points.The bear paints the area bounded by the chosen points and segments thei-th color.Note that after thek-th move some parts of the picture can stay unpainted.The bear asked you to calculate, how many distinct ways there are to paint his picture. A way to paint the picture is a sequence of three-element sets of points he chose on each step. Two sequences are considered distinct if there is such numberi(1 ≤i≤k), that thei-th members of these sequences do not coincide as sets. As the sought number can be rather large, you only need to calculate the remainder after dividing it by number1000000007(109+ 7).InputThe first line contains two integersnandk, separated by a space (0 ≤n,k≤ 200).OutputPrint exactly one integer — the answer to the problem modulo1000000007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput0 0Output1Input0 1Output8Input0 2Output32Input1 1Output32",
