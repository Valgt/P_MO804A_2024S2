A Stroll Around the Matrixtime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWilliam has two arrays of numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_m$$$. The arrays satisfy the conditions of being convex. Formally an array $$$c$$$ of length $$$k$$$ is considered convex if $$$c_i - c_{i - 1} < c_{i + 1} - c_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$k - 1$$$ and $$$c_1 < c_2$$$.Throughout William's life he observed $$$q$$$ changes of two types happening to the arrays:Add the arithmetic progression $$$d, d \\\\cdot 2, d \\\\cdot 3, \\\\dots, d \\\\cdot k$$$ to the suffix of the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$. The array after the change looks like this: $$$[a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_{n - k}, a_{n - k + 1} + d, a_{n - k + 2} + d \\\\cdot 2, \\\\dots, a_n + d \\\\cdot k]$$$.The same operation, but for array $$$b$$$.After each change a matrix $$$d$$$ is created from arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$, where $$$d_{i, j}=a_i + b_j$$$. William wants to get from cell ($$$1, 1$$$) to cell ($$$n, m$$$) of this matrix. From cell ($$$x, y$$$) he can only move to cells ($$$x + 1, y$$$) and ($$$x, y + 1$$$). The length of a path is calculated as the sum of numbers in cells visited by William, including the first and the last cells.After each change William wants you to help find out the minimal length of the path he could take.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100, 2 \\\\le m \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 10^5$$$), the sizes of the arrays and the number of changes.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^{12}$$$), the contents of array $$$a$$$.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 10^{12}$$$), the contents of array $$$b$$$.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains three integers $$$type$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le type \\\\le 2$$$, if $$$type = 1$$$, then $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$ otherwise $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le m$$$, $$$1 \\\\le d \\\\le 10^3$$$).OutputAfter each change, output one integer, the minimum length of the path in the constructed matrix.ExamplesInput5 3 4 1 2 4 7 11 5 7 10 1 3 2 2 2 5 1 5 4 2 1 7Output98 128 219 229Input5 6 7 4 9 22 118 226 7 94 238 395 565 738 2 1 95 1 4 54 1 2 5 1 2 87 2 6 62 2 1 143 1 1 77Output3639 5122 5162 5617 7663 7806 7960",
