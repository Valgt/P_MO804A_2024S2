String Searchingtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ different strings. Each string consists of $$$m$$$ lowercase Latin letters.You have to respond to $$$q$$$ queries. Each query contains a string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m+1$$$. Count the number of indices $$$i$$$, such that the string $$$t$$$ can be obtained from the string $$$s_i$$$, if it is allowed to insert one letter in an arbitrary position.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 10$$$) — the number of strings in the array and the length of each string.The following $$$n$$$ lines contain strings $$$s_i$$$. All of the given strings are different.The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.The following $$$q$$$ lines contain query strings $$$t$$$ of length $$$m + 1$$$.OutputFor each query, print the number of indices $$$i$$$, such that a string from the query can be obtained from the string $$$s_i$$$, if it is allowed to insert one letter in an arbitrary position.ExamplesInput2 1 a c 4 aa ca mm cfOutput1 2 0 1Input6 3 dba abd cbb ada add bdd 5 ccbb abdd adba bada ddddOutput1 3 2 1 0NoteExplanation of the first test of the example:the stringacan be transformed intoaaby inserting one letter;both stringsaandccan be transformed intocaby inserting one letter;neitheranorccan be transformed intommby inserting one letter;ccan be transformed intocfby inserting one letter.",
