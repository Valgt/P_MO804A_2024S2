For any real number $$$t$$$, consider the complete weighted graph on $$$n$$$ vertices $$$K_n(t)$$$ with weight of the edge between vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ equal to $$$w_{ij}(t) = a_i \\\\cdot a_j + t \\\\cdot (a_i + a_j)$$$.Let $$$f(t)$$$ be the cost of theminimum spanning treeof $$$K_n(t)$$$. Determine whether $$$f(t)$$$ is bounded above and, if so, output the maximum value it attains.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices of the graph.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^6$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases is at most $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single line with the maximum value of $$$f(t)$$$ (it can be shown that it is an integer), orINFif $$$f(t)$$$ is not bounded above.ExampleInput521 02-1 131 -1 -233 -1 -241 2 3 -4OutputINF -1 INF -6 -18",
