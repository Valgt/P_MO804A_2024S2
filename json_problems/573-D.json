Me neither.Limak is a grizzly bear. He is general of the dreadful army of Bearland. The most important part of an army is cavalry of course.Cavalry of Bearland consists ofnwarriors andnhorses.i-th warrior has strengthwiandi-th horse has strengthhi. Warrior together with his horse is called a unit. Strength of a unit is equal to multiplied strengths of warrior and horse. Total strength of cavalry is equal to sum of strengths of allnunits. Good assignment of warriors and horses makes cavalry truly powerful.Initially,i-th warrior hasi-th horse. You are givenqqueries. In each query two warriors swap their horses with each other.General Limak must be ready for every possible situation. What if warriors weren't allowed to ride their own horses? After each query find the maximum possible strength of cavalry if we consider assignments of all warriors to all horses that no warrior is assigned to his own horse (it can be proven that forn≥ 2there is always at least one correct assignment).Note that we can't leave a warrior without a horse.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers,nandq(2 ≤n≤ 30 000,1 ≤q≤ 10 000).The second line containsnspace-separated integers,w1,w2, ...,wn(1 ≤wi≤ 106) — strengths of warriors.The third line containsnspace-separated integers,h1,h2, ...,hn(1 ≤hi≤ 106) — strengths of horses.Nextqlines describe queries.i-th of them contains two space-separated integersaiandbi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi), indices of warriors who swap their horses with each other.OutputPrintqlines with answers to queries.
