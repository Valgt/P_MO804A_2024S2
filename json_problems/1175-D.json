Array Splittingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$.You are asked to divide this array into $$$k$$$ non-empty consecutive subarrays. Every element in the array should be included in exactly one subarray. Let $$$f(i)$$$ be the index of subarray the $$$i$$$-th element belongs to. Subarrays are numbered from left to right and from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$.Let the cost of division be equal to $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n} (a_i \\\\cdot f(i))$$$. For example, if $$$a = [1, -2, -3, 4, -5, 6, -7]$$$ and we divide it into $$$3$$$ subbarays in the following way: $$$[1, -2, -3], [4, -5], [6, -7]$$$, then the cost of division is equal to $$$1 \\\\cdot 1 - 2 \\\\cdot 1 - 3 \\\\cdot 1 + 4 \\\\cdot 2 - 5 \\\\cdot 2 + 6 \\\\cdot 3 - 7 \\\\cdot 3 = -9$$$.Calculate the maximum cost you can obtain by dividing the array $$$a$$$ into $$$k$$$ non-empty consecutive subarrays.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$ |a_i| \\\\le 10^6$$$).OutputPrint the maximum cost you can obtain by dividing the array $$$a$$$ into $$$k$$$ nonempty consecutive subarrays.ExamplesInput5 2 -1 -2 5 -4 8Output15Input7 6 -3 0 -1 -2 -2 -4 -1Output-45Input4 1 3 -1 6 0Output8",
