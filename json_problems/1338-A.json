    "statement": "A. Powered Additiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. For every positive integer $$$x$$$ you are going to perform the following operation during the $$$x$$$-th second:Select some distinct indices $$$i_{1}, i_{2}, \\\\ldots, i_{k}$$$ which are between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ inclusive, and add $$$2^{x-1}$$$ to each corresponding position of $$$a$$$. Formally, $$$a_{i_{j}} := a_{i_{j}} + 2^{x-1}$$$ for $$$j = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, k$$$.Note that you are allowed to not select any indices at all.You have to make $$$a$$$ nondecreasing as fast as possible. Find the smallest number $$$T$$$ such that you can make the array nondecreasing after at most $$$T$$$ seconds.Array $$$a$$$ is nondecreasing if and only if $$$a_{1} \\\\le a_{2} \\\\le \\\\ldots \\\\le a_{n}$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^{4}$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{5}$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $$$10^{5}$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, \\\\ldots, a_{n}$$$ ($$$-10^{9} \\\\le a_{i} \\\\le 10^{9}$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the minimum number of seconds in which you can make $$$a$$$ nondecreasing.ExampleInput341 7 6 551 2 3 4 520 -4Output2 0 3NoteIn the first test case, if you select indices $$$3, 4$$$ at the $$$1$$$-st second and $$$4$$$ at the $$$2$$$-nd second, then $$$a$$$ will become $$$[1, 7, 7, 8]$$$. There are some other possible ways to make $$$a$$$ nondecreasing in $$$2$$$ seconds, but you can't do it faster.In the second test case, $$$a$$$ is already nondecreasing, so answer is $$$0$$$.In the third test case, if you do nothing at first $$$2$$$ seconds and select index $$$2$$$ at the $$$3$$$-rd second, $$$a$$$ will become $$$[0, 0]$$$.",
