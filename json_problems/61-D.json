The victory was such a great one that Shapur decided to carve a scene of Valerian's defeat on a mountain. So he had to find the best place to make his victory eternal!He decided to visit allncities of Persia to find the best available mountain, but after the recent war he was too tired and didn't want to traverse a lot. So he wanted to visit each of thesencities at least once with smallest possible traverse. Persian cities are connected with bidirectional roads. You can go from any city to any other one using these roads and there is a unique path between each two cities.All cities are numbered1ton. Shapur is currently in the city1and he wants to visit all other cities with minimum possible traverse. He can finish his travels in any city.Help Shapur find how much He should travel.InputFirst line contains a single natural numbern(1 ≤n≤ 105) — the amount of cities.Nextn- 1lines contain3integer numbers eachxi,yiandwi(1 ≤xi,yi≤n, 0 ≤wi≤ 2 × 104).xiandyiare two ends of a road andwiis the length of that road.OutputA single integer number, the minimal length of Shapur's travel.Please, do not use%lldspecificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.
