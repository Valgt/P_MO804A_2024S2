    "statement": "A. Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutVitaly has an array ofndistinct integers. Vitaly wants to divide this array into threenon-emptysets so as the following conditions hold:The product of all numbers in the first set is less than zero( < 0).The product of all numbers in the second set is greater than zero( > 0).The product of all numbers in the third set is equal to zero.Each number from the initial array must occur in exactly one set.Help Vitaly. Divide the given array.InputThe first line of the input contains integern(3 ≤n≤ 100). The second line containsnspace-separated distinct integersa1,a2, ...,an(|ai| ≤ 103)— the array elements.OutputIn the first line print integern1(n1> 0)— the number of elements in the first set. Then printn1numbers — the elements that got to the first set.In the next line print integern2(n2> 0)— the number of elements in the second set. Then printn2numbers — the elements that got to the second set.In the next line print integern3(n3> 0)— the number of elements in the third set. Then printn3numbers — the elements that got to the third set.The printed sets must meet the described conditions. It is guaranteed that the solution exists. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput3-1 2 0Output1 -11 21 0Input4-1 -2 -3 0Output1 -12 -3 -21 0",
