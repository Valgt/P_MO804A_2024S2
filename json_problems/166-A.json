You got hold of the contest's final results table. The table has the following data. For each team we are shown two numbers: the number of problems and the total penalty time. However, for no team we are shown its final place.You know the rules of comparing the results of two given teams very well. Let's say that teamasolvedpaproblems with total penalty timetaand teambsolvedpbproblems with total penalty timetb. Teamagets a higher place than teambin the end, if it either solved more problems on the contest, or solved the same number of problems but in less total time. In other words, teamagets a higher place than teambin the final results' table if eitherpa>pb, orpa=pbandta<tb.It is considered that the teams that solve the same number of problems with the same penalty time share all corresponding places. More formally, let's say there is a group ofxteams that solved the same number of problems with the same penalty time. Let's also say thatyteams performed better than the teams from this group. In this case all teams from the group share placesy+ 1,y+ 2,...,y+x. The teams that performed worse than the teams from this group, get their places in the results table starting from they+x+ 1-th place.Your task is to count what number of teams from the given list shared thek-th place.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤k≤n≤ 50). Thennlines contain the description of the teams: thei-th line contains two integerspiandti(1 ≤pi,ti≤ 50) — the number of solved problems and the total penalty time of thei-th team, correspondingly. All numbers in the lines are separated by spaces.OutputIn the only line print the sought number of teams that got thek-th place in the final results' table.ExamplesInput7 24 104 104 103 202 12 11 10Output3Input5 43 13 15 33 13 1Output4NoteThe final results' table for the first sample is:1-3 places — 4 solved problems, the penalty time equals 104 place — 3 solved problems, the penalty time equals 205-6 places — 2 solved problems, the penalty time equals 17 place — 1 solved problem, the penalty time equals 10The table shows that the second place is shared by the teams that solved 4 problems with penalty time 10. There are 3 such teams.The final table for the second sample is:1 place — 5 solved problems, the penalty time equals 32-5 places — 3 solved problems, the penalty time equals 1The table shows that the fourth place is shared by the teams that solved 3 problems with penalty time 1. There are 4 such teams.",
