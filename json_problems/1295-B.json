Infinite Prefixestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of0-s and1-s. You build an infinite string $$$t$$$ as a concatenation of an infinite number of strings $$$s$$$, or $$$t = ssss \\\\dots$$$ For example, if $$$s =$$$10010, then $$$t =$$$100101001010010...Calculate the number of prefixes of $$$t$$$ withbalanceequal to $$$x$$$. The balance of some string $$$q$$$ is equal to $$$cnt_{0, q} - cnt_{1, q}$$$, where $$$cnt_{0, q}$$$ is the number of occurrences of0in $$$q$$$, and $$$cnt_{1, q}$$$ is the number of occurrences of1in $$$q$$$. The number of such prefixes can be infinite; if it is so, you must say that.A prefix is a string consisting of several first letters of a given string, without any reorders. An empty prefix is also a valid prefix. For example, the string \"abcd\" has 5 prefixes: empty string, \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\" and \"abcd\".InputThe first line contains the single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.Next $$$2T$$$ lines contain descriptions of test cases — two lines per test case. The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$-10^9 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$ and the desired balance, respectively.The second line contains the binary string $$$s$$$ ($$$|s| = n$$$, $$$s_i \\\\in \\\\{\\\\text{0}, \\\\text{1}\\\\}$$$).It's guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$T$$$ integers — one per test case. For each test case print the number of prefixes or $$$-1$$$ if there is an infinite number of such prefixes.ExampleInput4 6 10 010010 5 3 10101 1 0 0 2 0 01Output3 0 1 -1NoteIn the first test case, there are 3 good prefixes of $$$t$$$: with length $$$28$$$, $$$30$$$ and $$$32$$$.",
