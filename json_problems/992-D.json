Nastya and a Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNastya received one more array on her birthday, this array can be used to play a traditional Byteland game on it. However, to play the game the players should first select such a subsegment of the array that, wherepis the product of all integers on the given array,sis their sum, andkis a given constant for all subsegments.Nastya wonders how many subsegments of the array fit the described conditions. A subsegment of an array is several consecutive integers of the array.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 2·105,1 ≤k≤ 105), wherenis the length of the array andkis the constant described above.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 108) — the elements of the array.OutputIn the only line print the number of subsegments such that the ratio between the product and the sum on them is equal tok.ExamplesInput1 11Output1Input4 26 3 8 1Output2NoteIn the first example the only subsegment is[1]. The sum equals1, the product equals1, so it suits us because.There are two suitable subsegments in the second example —[6, 3]and[3, 8, 1]. Subsegment[6, 3]has sum9and product18, so it suits us because. Subsegment[3, 8, 1]has sum12and product24, so it suits us because.",
