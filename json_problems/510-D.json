In this game there is an infinite long tape with cells indexed by integers (positive, negative and zero). At the beginning she is standing at the cell 0.There are alsoncards, each card has 2 attributes: lengthliand costci. If she payscidollars then she can applyi-th card. After applyingi-th card she becomes able to make jumps of lengthli, i. e. from cellxto cell(x-li)or cell(x+li).She wants to be able to jump to any cell on the tape (possibly, visiting some intermediate cells). For achieving this goal, she wants to buy some cards, paying as little money as possible.If this is possible, calculate the minimal cost.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 300), number of cards.The second line containsnnumbersli(1 ≤li≤ 109), the jump lengths of cards.The third line containsnnumbersci(1 ≤ci≤ 105), the costs of cards.OutputIf it is impossible to buy some cards and become able to jump to any cell, output -1. Otherwise output the minimal cost of buying such set of cards.ExamplesInput3100 99 99001 1 1Output2Input510 20 30 40 501 1 1 1 1Output-1Input715015 10010 6006 4290 2730 2310 11 1 1 1 1 1 10Output6Input84264 4921 6321 6984 2316 8432 6120 10264264 4921 6321 6984 2316 8432 6120 1026Output7237NoteIn first sample test, buying one card is not enough: for example, if you buy a card with length 100, you can't jump to any cell whose index is not a multiple of 100. The best way is to buy first and second card, that will make you be able to jump to any cell.In the second sample test, even if you buy all cards, you can't jump to any cell whose index is not a multiple of 10, so you should output -1.",
