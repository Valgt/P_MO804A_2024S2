Infinite Settime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$distinctpositive integers.Let's consider an infinite integer set $$$S$$$ which contains all integers $$$x$$$ that satisfy at least one of the following conditions:$$$x = a_i$$$ for some $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$.$$$x = 2y + 1$$$ and $$$y$$$ is in $$$S$$$.$$$x = 4y$$$ and $$$y$$$ is in $$$S$$$.For example, if $$$a = [1,2]$$$ then the $$$10$$$ smallest elements in $$$S$$$ will be $$$\\\\{1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12\\\\}$$$.Find the number of elements in $$$S$$$ that are strictly smaller than $$$2^p$$$. Since this number may be too large, print it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$p$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq n, p \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5)$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9)$$$.It is guaranteed that all the numbers in $$$a$$$ are distinct.OutputPrint a single integer, the number of elements in $$$S$$$ that are strictly smaller than $$$2^p$$$.
