Bribestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRuritania is a country with a very badly maintained road network, which is not exactly good news for lorry drivers that constantly have to do deliveries. In fact, when roads are maintained, they becomeone-way. It turns out that it is sometimes impossible to get from one town to another in a legal way – however, we know that all towns arereachable, thoughillegally!Fortunately for us, the police tend to be very corrupt and they will allow a lorry driver to break the rules and drive in the wrong direction provided they receive ‘a small gift’. There is one patrol car for every road and they will request 1000 Ruritanian dinars when a driver drives in the wrong direction. However, being greedy, every time a patrol car notices the same driver breaking the rule, they will chargedoublethe amount of money they requested the previous time on that particular road.Borna is a lorry driver that managed to figure out this bribing pattern. As part of his job, he has to makeKstops in some towns all over Ruritania and he has to make these stops in a certain order. There areNtowns (enumerated from 1 toN) in Ruritania and Borna’s initial location is the capital city i.e. town 1. He happens to know which ones out of theN- 1roads in Ruritania are currently unidirectional, but he is unable to compute the least amount of money he needs to prepare for bribing the police. Help Borna by providing him with an answer and you will be richly rewarded.InputThe first line containsN, the number of towns in Ruritania. The followingN- 1lines contain information regarding individual roads between towns. A road is represented by a tuple of integers (a,b,x), which are separated with a single whitespace character. The numbersaandbrepresent the cities connected by this particular road, and x is either 0 or 1: 0 means that the road is bidirectional, 1 means that only thea→bdirection is legal. The next line containsK, the number of stops Borna has to make. The final line of input contains K positive integerss1, …,sK: the towns Borna has to visit.1 ≤N≤ 1051 ≤K≤ 1061 ≤a,b≤Nfor all roadsfor all roads1 ≤si≤Nfor all1 ≤i≤KOutputThe output should contain a single number: the least amount of thousands of Ruritanian dinars Borna should allocate for bribes, modulo109+ 7.ExamplesInput51 2 02 3 05 1 13 4 155 4 5 2 2Output4NoteBorna first takes the route1 → 5and has to pay 1000 dinars. After that, he takes the route5 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4and pays nothing this time. However, when he has to return via4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 5, he needs to prepare 3000 (1000+2000) dinars. Afterwards, getting to 2 via5 → 1 → 2will cost him nothing. Finally, he doesn't even have to leave town 2 to get to 2, so there is no need to prepare any additional bribe money. Hence he has to prepare 4000 dinars in total.",
