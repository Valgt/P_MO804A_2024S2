Given a positive integernrepresent it as a sum ofmaximum possiblenumber of prime numbers. One can prove that such representation exists for any integer greater than1.Recall that integerkis calledprimeif it is greater than1and has exactly two positive integer divisors —1andk.InputThe only line of the input contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 100 000).OutputThe first line of the output contains a single integerk— maximum possible number of primes in representation.The second line should containkprimes with their sum equal ton. You can print them in any order. If there are several optimal solution, print any of them.ExamplesInput5Output22 3Input6Output32 2 2",
