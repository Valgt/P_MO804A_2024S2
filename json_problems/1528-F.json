Specifically, the arrays consisting of $$$n$$$ elements from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ that can be turned into permutations of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ by adding a non-negative integer to each element.Mashtaliwho wants to appear in every problem statementthinks that an array $$$b$$$ consisting of $$$k$$$ elements is compatible with amore-equalarray $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ elements if for each $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le k$$$ we have $$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le n$$$ and also $$$a_{b_1} = a_{b_2} = \\\\ldots = a_{b_k}$$$.Find the number of pairs of arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that $$$a$$$ is a more-equal array consisting of $$$n$$$ elements and $$$b$$$ is an array compatible with $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$k$$$ elements modulo $$$998244353$$$.Note that the elements of $$$b$$$ arenot necessarily distinct, same holds for $$$a$$$.InputThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9 , 1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^5)$$$.OutputPrint a single integer â€” the answer to the problem modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExamplesInput1 1Output1Input2 2Output8Input5 4Output50400Input20 100Output807645526Input10000000 10000Output883232350NoteThere are eight possible pairs for the second example:$$$a = \\\\{1, 1\\\\}, b = \\\\{1, 1\\\\}$$$$$$a = \\\\{1, 1\\\\}, b = \\\\{1, 2\\\\}$$$$$$a = \\\\{1, 1\\\\}, b = \\\\{2, 1\\\\}$$$$$$a = \\\\{1, 1\\\\}, b = \\\\{2, 2\\\\}$$$$$$a = \\\\{1, 2\\\\}, b = \\\\{1, 1\\\\}$$$$$$a = \\\\{1, 2\\\\}, b = \\\\{2, 2\\\\}$$$$$$a = \\\\{2, 1\\\\}, b = \\\\{1, 1\\\\}$$$$$$a = \\\\{2, 1\\\\}, b = \\\\{2, 2\\\\}$$$",
