A player is responsible for a whole country and he can travel there freely, complete quests and earn experience.This country hasncities connected bymbidirectional roads of different lengths so that it is possible to get from any city to any other one. There are portals inkof these cities. At the beginning of the game all portals are closed. When a player visits a portal city, the portal opens. Strange as it is, one can teleport from an open portal to an open one. The teleportation takes no time and that enables the player to travel quickly between rather remote regions of the country.At the beginning of the game Pavel is in city number1. He wants to open all portals as quickly as possible. How much time will he need for that?InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 105,0 ≤m≤ 105) that show how many cities and roads are in the game.Each of the nextmlines contains the description of a road as three space-separated integersxi,yi,wi(1 ≤xi,yi≤n,xi≠yi,1 ≤wi≤ 109) — the numbers of the cities connected by thei-th road and the time needed to go from one city to the other one by this road. Any two cities are connected by no more than one road. It is guaranteed that we can get from any city to any other one, moving along the roads of the country.The next line contains integerk(1 ≤k≤n) — the number of portals.The next line containskspace-separated integersp1,p2, ...,pk— numbers of the cities with installed portals. Each city has no more than one portal.OutputPrint a single number — the minimum time a player needs to open all portals.Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.ExamplesInput3 31 2 11 3 12 3 131 2 3Output2Input4 31 2 12 3 52 4 1032 3 4Output16Input4 31 2 10000000002 3 10000000003 4 100000000041 2 3 4Output3000000000NoteIn the second sample the player has to come to city2, open a portal there, then go to city3, open a portal there, teleport back to city2and finally finish the journey in city4.",
