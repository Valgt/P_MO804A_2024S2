On the intersection of thei-th row (1 ≤i≤n) and thej-th column (1 ≤j≤m) there is a non-negative integerai,j. Besides, you've got a non-negative integerk.Your task is to find such pair of integers(a,b)that meets these conditions:k≤a≤n-k+ 1;k≤b≤m-k+ 1;let's denote the maximum of the functionamong all integersxandy, that satisfy the inequalitiesk≤x≤n-k+ 1andk≤y≤m-k+ 1, asmval; for the required pair of numbers the following equation must holdf(a,b) =mval.InputThe first line contains three space-separated integersn,mandk(1 ≤n,m≤ 1000,). Nextnlines each containsmintegers: thej-th number on thei-th line equalsai,j(0 ≤ai,j≤ 106).The numbers in the lines are separated by spaces.OutputPrint the required pair of integersaandb. Separate the numbers by a space.If there are multiple correct answers, you are allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput4 4 21 2 3 41 1 1 12 2 2 24 3 2 1Output3 2Input5 7 38 2 3 4 2 3 33 4 6 2 3 4 68 7 6 8 4 5 71 2 3 2 1 3 24 5 3 2 1 2 1Output3 3",
