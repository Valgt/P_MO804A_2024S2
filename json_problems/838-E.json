    "statement": "E. Convex Countourtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an strictly convex polygon withnvertices. It is guaranteed that no three points are collinear. You would like to take a maximum non intersecting path on the polygon vertices that visits each point at most once.More specifically your path can be represented as some sequence of distinct polygon vertices. Your path is the straight line segments between adjacent vertices in order. These segments are not allowed to touch or intersect each other except at the vertices in your sequence.Given the polygon, print the maximum length non-intersecting path that visits each point at most once.InputThe first line of input will contain a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 2 500), the number of points.The nextnlines will contain two integersxi,yi(|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109), denoting the coordinates of thei-th vertex.It is guaranteed that these points are listed in clockwise order.OutputPrint a single floating point number, representing the longest non-intersecting path that visits the vertices at most once.Your answer will be accepted if it has absolute or relative error at most10- 9. More specifically, if your answer isaand the jury answer isb, your answer will be accepted if.ExampleInput40 00 11 11 0Output3.4142135624NoteOne optimal path is to visit points 0,1,3,2 in order.",
