Suppose you are given a tree consisting ofnvertices. The vertex of this tree is calledcentroidif the size of each connected component that appears if this vertex is removed from the tree doesn't exceed.You are given a tree of sizenand can perform no more than one edge replacement.Edge replacementis the operation of removing one edge from the tree (without deleting incident vertices) and inserting one new edge (without adding new vertices) in such a way that the graph remains a tree. For each vertex you have to determine if it's possible to make it centroid by performing no more than one edge replacement.InputThe first line of the input contains an integern(2 ≤n≤ 400 000) — the number of vertices in the tree. Each of the nextn- 1lines contains a pair of vertex indicesuiandvi(1 ≤ui,vi≤n) — endpoints of the corresponding edge.OutputPrintnintegers.

For example, in order to turn vertex1to centroid one have to replace the edge(2, 3)with the edge(1, 3).",
