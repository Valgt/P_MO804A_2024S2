    "statement": "A. System Administratortime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutPolycarpus is a system administrator. There are two servers under his strict guidance —aandb. To stay informed about the servers' performance, Polycarpus executes commands \"ping a\" and \"ping b\". Each ping command sends exactly ten packets to the server specified in the argument of the command. Executing a program results in two integersxandy(x+y= 10;x,y≥ 0). These numbers mean thatxpackets successfully reached the corresponding server through the network andypackets were lost.Today Polycarpus has performed overallnping commands during his workday. Now for each server Polycarpus wants to know whether the server is \"alive\" or not. Polycarpus thinks that the server is \"alive\", if at least half of the packets that we send to this server reached it successfully along the network.Help Polycarpus, determine for each server, whether it is \"alive\" or not by the given commands and their results.InputThe first line contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 1000)— the number of commands Polycarpus has fulfilled. Each of the followingnlines contains three integers — the description of the commands. Thei-th of these lines contains three space-separated integersti,xi,yi(1 ≤ti≤ 2;xi,yi≥ 0;xi+yi= 10). Ifti= 1, then thei-th command is \"ping a\", otherwise thei-th command is \"ping b\". Numbersxi,yirepresent the result of executing this command, that is,xipackets reached the corresponding server successfully andyipackets were lost.It is guaranteed that the input has at least one \"ping a\" command and at least one \"ping b\" command.OutputIn the first line print string \"LIVE\" (without the quotes) if serverais \"alive\", otherwise print \"DEAD\" (without the quotes).In the second line print the state of serverbin the similar format.ExamplesInput21 5 52 6 4OutputLIVELIVEInput31 0 102 0 101 10 0OutputLIVEDEADNoteConsider the first test case. There 10 packets were sent to servera, 5 of them reached it. Therefore, at least half of all packets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network. Overall there were 10 packets sent to serverb, 6 of them reached it. Therefore, at least half of all packets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network.Consider the second test case. There were overall 20 packages sent to servera, 10 of them reached it. Therefore, at least half of all packets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network. Overall 10 packets were sent to serverb, 0 of them reached it. Therefore, less than half of all packets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network.",
