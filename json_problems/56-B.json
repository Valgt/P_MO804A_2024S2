Naturally, Vasya keeps all the coins in his collection in the order in which they were released. Once Vasya's younger brother made a change — he took all the coins whose release year dated fromltorinclusively and put them in the reverse order. That is, he took a certain segment[l,r]and reversed it. At that the segment's endpoints did not coincide. For example, ifn= 8, then initially Vasya's coins were kept in the order1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. If Vasya's younger brother chose the segment[2, 6], then after the reversal the coin order will change to1 6 5 4 3 2 7 8. Vasya suspects that someone else could have spoilt the permutation after his brother. Help him to find that out. Check if the given permutation can be obtained from the permutation1 2 ...nusing exactly one segment reversal. If it is possible, find the segment itself.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 1000) which is the number of coins in Vasya's collection. The second line contains space-separatednintegers which are the spoilt sequence of coins. It is guaranteed that the given sequence is a permutation, i.e. it contains only integers from1ton, and every number is used exactly 1 time.OutputIf it is impossible to obtain the given permutation from the original one in exactly one action, print0 0. Otherwise, print two numberslr(1 ≤l<r≤n) which are the endpoints of the segment that needs to be reversed to obtain from permutation1 2 ...nthe given one.ExamplesInput81 6 5 4 3 2 7 8Output2 6Input42 3 4 1Output0 0Input41 2 3 4Output0 0",
