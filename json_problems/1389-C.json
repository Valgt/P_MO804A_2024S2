Good Stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's callleft cyclic shiftof some string $$$t_1 t_2 t_3 \\\\dots t_{n - 1} t_n$$$ as string $$$t_2 t_3 \\\\dots t_{n - 1} t_n t_1$$$.Analogically, let's callright cyclic shiftof string $$$t$$$ as string $$$t_n t_1 t_2 t_3 \\\\dots t_{n - 1}$$$.Let's say string $$$t$$$ isgoodif its left cyclic shift is equal to its right cyclic shift.You are given string $$$s$$$ which consists of digits0–9.What is the minimum number of characters you need to erase from $$$s$$$ to make it good?InputThe first line contains single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Next $$$t$$$ lines contains test cases — one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains string $$$s$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$). Each character $$$s_i$$$ is digit0–9.It's guaranteed that the total length of strings doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum number of characters you need to erase from $$$s$$$ to make it good.ExampleInput3 95831 100120013 252525252525Output3 5 0NoteIn the first test case, you can erase any $$$3$$$ characters, for example, the $$$1$$$-st, the $$$3$$$-rd, and the $$$4$$$-th. You'll get string51and it is good.In the second test case, we can erase all characters except0: the remaining string is0000and it's good.In the third test case, the given string $$$s$$$ is already good.",
