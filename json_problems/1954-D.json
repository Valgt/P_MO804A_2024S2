    "statement": "D. Colored Ballstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are balls of $$$n$$$ different colors; the number of balls of the $$$i$$$-th color is $$$a_i$$$.The balls can be combined into groups. Each group should contain at most $$$2$$$ balls, and no more than $$$1$$$ ball of each color.Consider all $$$2^n$$$ sets of colors. For a set of colors, let's denote itsvalueas the minimum number of groups the balls of those colors can be distributed into. For example, if there are three colors with $$$3$$$, $$$1$$$ and $$$7$$$ balls respectively, they can be combined into $$$7$$$ groups (and not less than $$$7$$$), so the value of that set of colors is $$$7$$$.Your task is to calculate the sum ofvaluesover all $$$2^n$$$ possible sets of colors. Since the answer may be too large, print it modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5000$$$) — the number of colors.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 5000$$$) — the number of balls of the $$$i$$$-th color.Additional constraint on input: the total number of balls doesn't exceed $$$5000$$$.OutputPrint a single integer — the sum of values of all $$$2^n$$$ sets of colors, taken modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.ExamplesInput31 1 2Output11Input15Output5Input41 3 3 7Output76NoteConsider the first example. There are $$$8$$$ sets of colors:for the empty set, its value is $$$0$$$;for the set $$$\\\\{1\\\\}$$$, its value is $$$1$$$;for the set $$$\\\\{2\\\\}$$$, its value is $$$1$$$;for the set $$$\\\\{3\\\\}$$$, its value is $$$2$$$;for the set $$$\\\\{1,2\\\\}$$$, its value is $$$1$$$;for the set $$$\\\\{1,3\\\\}$$$, its value is $$$2$$$;for the set $$$\\\\{2,3\\\\}$$$, its value is $$$2$$$;for the set $$$\\\\{1,2,3\\\\}$$$, its value is $$$2$$$.So, the sum of values over all $$$2^n$$$ sets of colors is $$$11$$$.",
