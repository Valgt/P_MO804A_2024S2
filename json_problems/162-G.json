Calculate their sum and output it written in the same base.InputThe first line of the input contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 10) — the size of the array. The second line contains an integerradix(2 ≤radix≤ 36) — the base of the numeral system used. Nextnlines contain the elements of the array, one per line.Each element is a non-negative integer written inradix-based notation, possibly with leading zeros, which contains between 1 and 5 digits, inclusive. The digits of the notation will be 0, 1, ..., 9, A, B, ..., Z in the given order.OutputOutput the sum of array elements inradix-based notation. Use the same format as in the input.ExamplesInput316F020B004Output2FFInput2101234Output46",
