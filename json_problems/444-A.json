    "statement": "A. DZY Loves Physicstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutDZY loves Physics, and he enjoys calculating density.Almost everything has density, even a graph. We define the density of a non-directed graph (nodes and edges of the graph have some values) as follows:wherevis the sum of the values of the nodes,eis the sum of the values of the edges.Once DZY got a graphG, now he wants to find a connected induced subgraphG'of the graph, such that the density ofG'is as large as possible.An induced subgraphG'(V',E')of a graphG(V,E)is a graph that satisfies:;edgeif and only if, and edge;the value of an edge inG'is the same as the value of the corresponding edge inG, so as the value of a node.Help DZY to find the induced subgraph with maximum density. Note that the induced subgraph you choose must be connected.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersn(1 ≤n≤ 500),. Integernrepresents the number of nodes of the graphG,mrepresents the number of edges.The second line containsnspace-separated integersxi(1 ≤xi≤ 106), wherexirepresents the value of thei-th node. Consider the graph nodes are numbered from1ton.Each of the nextmlines contains three space-separated integersai,bi,ci(1 ≤ai<bi≤n; 1 ≤ci≤ 103), denoting an edge between nodeaiandbiwith valueci. The graph won't contain multiple edges.OutputOutput a real number denoting the answer, with an absolute or relative error of at most10- 9.ExamplesInput1 01Output0.000000000000000Input2 11 21 2 1Output3.000000000000000Input5 613 56 73 98 171 2 561 3 291 4 422 3 952 4 883 4 63Output2.965517241379311NoteIn the first sample, you can only choose an empty subgraph, or the subgraph containing only node1.In the second sample, choosing the whole graph is optimal.",
