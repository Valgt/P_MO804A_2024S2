Weighting a Treetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a connected undirected graph withnvertices andmedges. The vertices are enumerated from1ton.You are givennintegersc1,c2, ...,cn, each of them is between-nandn, inclusive. It is also guaranteed that the parity ofcvequals the parity of degree of vertexv. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.You are to write a weight between- 2·n2and2·n2(inclusive) on each edge in such a way, that for each vertexvthe sum of weights on edges connected to this vertex is equal tocv, or determine that this is impossible.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(2 ≤n≤ 105,n- 1 ≤m≤ 105) — the number of vertices and the number of edges.The next line containsnintegersc1,c2, ...,cn(-n≤ci≤n), whereciis the required sum of weights of edges connected to vertexi. It is guaranteed that the parity ofciequals the parity of degree of vertexi.The nextmlines describe edges of the graph.
