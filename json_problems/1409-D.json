In one move, you can increase $$$n$$$ by one (i.e. make $$$n := n + 1$$$). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to perform in order to make the sum of digits of $$$n$$$ be less than or equal to $$$s$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{18}$$$; $$$1 \\\\le s \\\\le 162$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves you need to perform in order to make the sum of digits of $$$n$$$ be less than or equal to $$$s$$$.ExampleInput5 2 1 1 1 500 4 217871987498122 10 100000000000000001 1Output8 0 500 2128012501878 899999999999999999",
