Let $$$S$$$ be the set ofallpositive integer divisors of $$$x$$$ (including $$$1$$$ and $$$x$$$ itself).We call a set of integers $$$D$$$goodif (and only if) there is no pair $$$a \\\\in D$$$, $$$b \\\\in D$$$ such that $$$a \\\\ne b$$$ and $$$a$$$ divides $$$b$$$.Find agoodsubset of $$$S$$$ with maximum possible size. Since the answer can be large, print the size of the subset modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of prime divisors in representation of $$$x$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le p_i \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^6$$$) — the prime factorization of $$$x$$$.OutputPrint the maximum possible size of agoodsubset modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExamplesInput3 2999999 43 2999957Output3Input6 2 3 2 3 2 2Output3NoteIn the first sample, $$$x = 2999999 \\\\cdot 43 \\\\cdot 2999957$$$ and one of the maximum good subsets is $$$\\\\{ 43, 2999957, 2999999 \\\\}$$$.In the second sample, $$$x = 2 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 2 = 144$$$ and one of the maximum good subsets is $$$\\\\{ 9, 12, 16 \\\\}$$$.",
