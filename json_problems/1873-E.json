Building an Aquariumtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou love fish, that's why you have decided to build an aquarium. You have a piece of coral made of $$$n$$$ columns, the $$$i$$$-th of which is $$$a_i$$$ units tall. Afterwards, you will build a tank around the coral as follows:Pick an integer $$$h \\\\geq 1$$$ — theheightof the tank. Build walls of height $$$h$$$ on either side of the tank.Then, fill the tank up with water so that the height of each column is $$$h$$$, unless the coral is taller than $$$h$$$; then no water should be added to this column.For example, with $$$a=[3,1,2,4,6,2,5]$$$ and a height of $$$h=4$$$, you will end up using a total of $$$w=8$$$ units of water, as shown.You can use at most $$$x$$$ units of water to fill up the tank, but you want to build the biggest tank possible. What is the largest value of $$$h$$$ you can select?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of columns of the coral and the maximum amount of water you can use.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the heights of the coral.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single positive integer $$$h$$$ ($$$h \\\\geq 1$$$) — the maximum height the tank can have, so you need at most $$$x$$$ units of water to fill up the tank.We have a proof that under these constraints, such a value of $$$h$$$ always exists.ExampleInput57 93 1 2 4 6 2 53 101 1 14 11 4 3 46 19842 6 5 9 1 81 10000000001Output4 4 2 335 1000000001NoteThe first test case is pictured in the statement. With $$$h=4$$$ we need $$$8$$$ units of water, but if $$$h$$$ is increased to $$$5$$$ we need $$$13$$$ units of water, which is more than $$$x=9$$$. So $$$h=4$$$ is optimal.In the second test case, we can pick $$$h=4$$$ and add $$$3$$$ units to each column, using a total of $$$9$$$ units of water. It can be shown that this is optimal.In the third test case, we can pick $$$h=2$$$ and use all of our water, so it is optimal.",
