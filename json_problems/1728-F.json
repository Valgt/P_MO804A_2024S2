Fishermentime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ fishermen who have just returned from a fishing trip. The $$$i$$$-th fisherman has caught a fish of size $$$a_i$$$.The fishermen will choose some order in which they are going to tell the size of the fish they caught (the order is just a permutation of size $$$n$$$). However, they are not entirely honest, and they may \"increase\" the size of the fish they have caught.Formally, suppose the chosen order of the fishermen is $$$[p_1, p_2, p_3, \\\\dots, p_n]$$$. Let $$$b_i$$$ be the value which the $$$i$$$-th fisherman in the order will tell to the other fishermen. The values $$$b_i$$$ are chosen as follows:the first fisherman in the order just honestly tells the actual size of the fish he has caught, so $$$b_1 = a_{p_1}$$$;every other fisherman wants to tell a value that isstrictly greaterthan the value told by the previous fisherman, and is divisible by the size of the fish that the fisherman has caught. So, for $$$i > 1$$$, $$$b_i$$$ is the smallest integer that is bothstrictly greaterthan $$$b_{i-1}$$$ anddivisible by$$$a_{p_i}$$$.For example, let $$$n = 7$$$, $$$a = [1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3]$$$. If the chosen order is $$$p = [1, 6, 7, 5, 3, 2, 4]$$$, then:$$$b_1 = a_{p_1} = 1$$$;$$$b_2$$$ is the smallest integer divisible by $$$2$$$ and greater than $$$1$$$, which is $$$2$$$;$$$b_3$$$ is the smallest integer divisible by $$$3$$$ and greater than $$$2$$$, which is $$$3$$$;$$$b_4$$$ is the smallest integer divisible by $$$2$$$ and greater than $$$3$$$, which is $$$4$$$;$$$b_5$$$ is the smallest integer divisible by $$$2$$$ and greater than $$$4$$$, which is $$$6$$$;$$$b_6$$$ is the smallest integer divisible by $$$8$$$ and greater than $$$6$$$, which is $$$8$$$;$$$b_7$$$ is the smallest integer divisible by $$$3$$$ and greater than $$$8$$$, which is $$$9$$$.You have to choose the order of fishermen in a way that yields the minimum possible $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n} b_i$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of fishermen.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$).OutputPrint one integer — the minimum possible value of $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n} b_i$$$ you can obtain by choosing the order of fishermen optimally.ExamplesInput7 1 8 2 3 2 2 3Output33Input10 5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6Output165",
