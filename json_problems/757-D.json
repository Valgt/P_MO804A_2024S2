Felicity's Big Secret Revealedtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe gym leaders were fascinated by the evolutions which took place at Felicity camp. So, they were curious to know about the secret behind evolving Pokemon.The organizers of the camp gave the gym leaders a PokeBlock, a sequence ofningredients. Each ingredient can be of type0or1. Now the organizers told the gym leaders that to evolve a Pokemon of typek(k≥ 2), they need to make a valid set ofkcuts on the PokeBlock to get smaller blocks.Suppose the given PokeBlock sequence isb0b1b2...bn- 1. You have a choice of making cuts atn+ 1places, i.e., Beforeb0, betweenb0andb1, betweenb1andb2, ..., betweenbn- 2andbn- 1, and afterbn- 1.Then+ 1choices of making cuts are as follows (where a|denotes a possible cut):|b0|b1|b2| ... |bn- 2|bn- 1|Consider a sequence ofkcuts. Now each pair of consecutive cuts will contain a binary string between them, formed from the ingredient types. The ingredients before the first cut and after the last cut are wasted, which is to say they are not considered. So there will be exactlyk- 1such binary substrings. Every substring can be read as a binary number. Letmbe the maximum number out of the obtained numbers. If all the obtained numbers are positive and the set of the obtained numbers contains all integers from1tom, then this set of cuts is said to be a valid set of cuts.For example, suppose the given PokeBlock sequence is101101001110and we made5cuts in the following way:10 | 11 | 010 | 01 | 1 | 10So the4binary substrings obtained are:11,010,01and1, which correspond to the numbers3,2,1and1respectively. Herem= 3, as it is the maximum value among the obtained numbers. And all the obtained numbers are positive and we have obtained all integers from1tom. Hence this set of cuts is a valid set of5cuts.A Pokemon of typekwill evolve only if the PokeBlock is cut using a valid set ofkcuts. There can be many valid sets of the same size. Two valid sets ofkcuts are considered different if there is a cut in one set which is not there in the other set.Letf(k)denote the number of valid sets ofkcuts. Find the value of. Since the value ofscan be very large, outputsmodulo109+ 7.InputThe input consists of two lines. The first line consists an integern(1 ≤n≤ 75) — the length of the PokeBlock. The next line contains the PokeBlock, a binary string of lengthn.OutputOutput a single integer, containing the answer to the problem, i.e., the value ofsmodulo109+ 7.ExamplesInput41011Output10Input210Output1NoteIn the first sample, the sets of valid cuts are:Size2:|1|011,1|01|1,10|1|1,101|1|.Size3:|1|01|1,|10|1|1,10|1|1|,1|01|1|.Size4:|10|1|1|,|1|01|1|.Hence,f(2) = 4,f(3) = 4andf(4) = 2. So, the value ofs= 10.In the second sample, the set of valid cuts is:Size2: |1|0.Hence,f(2) = 1andf(3) = 0. So, the value ofs= 1.",
