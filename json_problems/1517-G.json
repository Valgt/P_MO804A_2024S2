Starry Night Campingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAt the foot of Liyushan Mountain, $$$n$$$ tents will be carefully arranged to provide accommodation for those who are willing to experience the joy of approaching nature, the tranquility of the night, and the bright starry sky.The $$$i$$$-th tent is located at the point of $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ and has a weight of $$$w_i$$$. A tent isimportantif and only if both $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ are even. You need to remove some tents such that for each remaining important tent $$$(x, y)$$$, there do not exist $$$3$$$ other tents $$$(x'_1, y'_1)$$$, $$$(x'_2, y'_2)$$$ and $$$(x'_3, y'_3)$$$ such that both conditions are true:$$$|x'_j-x|, |y'_j - y|\\\\leq 1$$$ for all $$$j \\\\in \\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}$$$, andthese four tents form a parallelogram (or a rectangle) and one of its sides isparallel to the $$$x$$$-axis.Please maximize the sum of the weights of the tents that arenotremoved. Print the maximum value.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq 1\\\\,000$$$), representing the number of tents.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ and $$$w_i$$$ ($$$-10^9\\\\leq x_i,y_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1\\\\leq w_i\\\\leq 10^9$$$), representing the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th tent and its weight. No two tents are located at the same point.OutputA single integer â€” the maximum sum of the weights of the remaining tents.ExamplesInput5 0 0 4 0 1 5 1 0 3 1 1 1 -1 1 2Output12Input32 2 2 1 2 3 1 3 2 1 3 3 1 2 6 1 2 5 1 3 6 1 3 5 1 2 8 1 2 9 1 1 8 1 1 9 1 2 12 1 2 11 1 1 12 1 1 11 1 6 2 1 7 2 1 6 3 1 5 3 1 6 6 1 7 6 1 5 5 1 6 5 1 6 8 1 5 8 1 6 9 1 7 9 1 6 12 1 5 12 1 6 11 1 7 11 1Output24NoteHere is an illustration of the second example.
