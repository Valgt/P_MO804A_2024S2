Little Dima and Equationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLittle Dima misbehaved during a math lesson a lot and the nasty teacher Mr. Pickles gave him the following problem as a punishment.Find all integer solutionsx(0 <x< 109)of the equation:x=b·s(x)a+c,wherea,b,care some predetermined constant values and functions(x)determines the sum of all digits in the decimal representation of numberx.The teacher gives this problem to Dima for each lesson. He changes only the parameters of the equation:a,b,c. Dima got sick of getting bad marks and he asks you to help him solve this challenging problem.InputThe first line contains three space-separated integers:a,b,c(1 ≤a≤ 5; 1 ≤b≤ 10000;  - 10000 ≤c≤ 10000).OutputPrint integern— the number of the solutions that you've found. Next printnintegers in the increasing order — the solutions of the given equation. Print only integer solutions that are larger than zero and strictly less than109.ExamplesInput3 2 8Output310 2008 13726Input1 2 -18Output0Input2 2 -1Output41 31 337 967",
