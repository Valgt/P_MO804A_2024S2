Truncatable primestime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutA truncatable prime is a prime number which contains no zeros in decimal notation and all its suffixes are primes. 1 is considered to be not a prime.You are given a positive integern. Figure out whether it is a truncatable prime.InputThe only line of input contains an integern(2 ≤n≤ 107).OutputOutput \"YES\" ifnis a truncatable prime. Output \"NO\" otherwise. Quotes for clarity only.ExamplesInput19OutputNOInput9137OutputYESNoteIn the first sample 19 is a prime but its suffix 9 is not.In the second sample 9137, 137, 37 and 7 are all primes, so 9137 is a truncatable prime.",
