Treasure Hunttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDefine thebeauty valueof a sequence $$$b_1,b_2,\\\\ldots,b_c$$$ as the maximum value of $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{q}b_i + \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=s}^{t}b_i$$$, where $$$q$$$, $$$s$$$, $$$t$$$ are all integers and $$$s > q$$$ or $$$t\\\\leq q$$$. Note that $$$b_i = 0$$$ when $$$i<1$$$ or $$$i>c$$$, $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=s}^{t}b_i = 0$$$ when $$$s>t$$$.For example, when $$$b = [-1,-2,-3]$$$, we may have $$$q = 0$$$, $$$s = 3$$$, $$$t = 2$$$ so thebeautyvalue is $$$0 + 0 = 0$$$. And when $$$b = [-1,2,-3]$$$, we have $$$q = s = t = 2$$$ so thebeautyvalue is $$$1 + 2 = 3$$$.You are given a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, determine the sum of thebeauty valueof all non-empty subsegments $$$a_l,a_{l+1},\\\\ldots,a_r$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq l\\\\leq r\\\\leq n$$$) of the sequence $$$a$$$.Print the answer modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 10^6$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^6$$$) — the given sequence.It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a line containing a single integer — the answer modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.ExampleInput4780 59 100 -52 -86 -62 758-48 -14 -26 43 -41 34 13 551742056 -60 62 13 88 -48 64 36 -10 19 94 25 -69 88 87 79 -70 74 -26 59Output5924 2548 148 98887NoteIn the second test case, for the subsequence $$$[-26,43,-41,34,13]$$$, when $$$q=5$$$, $$$s=2$$$, $$$t=5$$$, $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{q}b_i + \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=s}^{t}b_i = 23 + 49 = 72$$$.In the third test case, there is only one non-empty consecutive subsequence $$$[74]$$$.
