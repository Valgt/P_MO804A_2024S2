Land Lottime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutVasya has a beautiful garden where wonderful fruit trees grow and yield fantastic harvest every year. But lately thieves started to sneak into the garden at nights and steal the fruit too often. Vasya can’t spend the nights in the garden and guard the fruit because there’s no house in the garden! Vasya had been saving in for some time and finally he decided to build the house. The rest is simple: he should choose in which part of the garden to build the house. In the evening he sat at his table and drew the garden’s plan. On the plan the garden is represented as a rectangular checkered fieldn×min size divided into squares whose side length is 1. In some squares Vasya marked the trees growing there (one shouldn’t plant the trees too close to each other that’s why one square contains no more than one tree). Vasya wants to find a rectangular land lota×bsquares in size to build a house on, at that the land lot border should go along the lines of the grid that separates the squares. All the trees that grow on the building lot will have to be chopped off. Vasya loves his garden very much, so help him choose the building land lot location so that the number of chopped trees would be as little as possible.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 50) which represent the garden location. The nextnlines containmnumbers 0 or 1, which describe the garden on the scheme. The zero means that a tree doesn’t grow on this square and the 1 means that there is a growing tree. The last line contains two integersaandb(1 ≤a,b≤ 50). Note that Vasya can choose for building ana×brectangle as well ab×aone, i.e. the side of the lot with the length ofacan be located as parallel to the garden side with the length ofn, as well as parallel to the garden side with the length ofm.OutputPrint the minimum number of trees that needs to be chopped off to select a land lota×bin size to build a house on.
