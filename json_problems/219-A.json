For example, the string \"aabaabaabaab\" is at the same time a 1-string, a 2-string and a 4-string, but it is not a 3-string, a 5-string, or a 6-string and so on. Obviously any string is a 1-string.You are given a strings, consisting of lowercase English letters and a positive integerk. Your task is to reorder the letters in the stringsin such a way that the resulting string is ak-string.InputThe first input line contains integerk(1 ≤k≤ 1000). The second line containss, all characters insare lowercase English letters. The string lengthssatisfies the inequality1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, where|s|is the length of strings.OutputRearrange the letters in stringsin such a way that the result is ak-string. Print the result on a single output line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.If the solution doesn't exist, print \"-1\" (without quotes).ExamplesInput2aazzOutputazazInput3abcabcabzOutput-1",
