From Zero To Ytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two positive (greater than zero) integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. There is a variable $$$k$$$ initially set to $$$0$$$.You can perform the following two types of operations:add $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ (i. e. assign $$$k := k + 1$$$);add $$$x \\\\cdot 10^{p}$$$ to $$$k$$$ for some non-negative $$$p$$$ (i. e. assign $$$k := k + x \\\\cdot 10^{p}$$$ for some $$$p \\\\ge 0$$$).Find the minimum number of operations described above to set the value of $$$k$$$ to $$$y$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two integer $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x, y \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations to set the value of $$$k$$$ to $$$y$$$.ExampleInput3 2 7 3 42 25 1337Output4 5 20NoteIn the first test case you can use the following sequence of operations:add $$$1$$$;add $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^0 = 2$$$;add $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^0 = 2$$$;add $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^0 = 2$$$.$$$1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7$$$.In the second test case you can use the following sequence of operations:add $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^1 = 30$$$;add $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^0 = 3$$$;add $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^0 = 3$$$;add $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^0 = 3$$$;add $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^0 = 3$$$.$$$30 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 42$$$.",
