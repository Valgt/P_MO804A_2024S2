To transform the original message into encrypted one using keyk, one has to replace each letter with a letter which iskpositions later in the alphabet (if this takes the position beyond Z, the rest of it is counted from the start of the alphabet). In a more formal way, if letters of the alphabet are enumerated starting with0, the result of encryption for characterxwill be(26is the number of letters in the Latin alphabet).You are given the original message and the encryption keyk. Output the resulting cipher.InputThe first line of input contains the original message — a sequence uppercase Latin letters («A»-«Z»). The length of the message is from1to10, inclusive.The second line contains an integerk(0 ≤k≤ 25).OutputOutput the result of encryption.ExamplesInputCODEFORCES5OutputHTIJKTWHJXInputWIXYZILWYM6OutputCODEFORCES",
