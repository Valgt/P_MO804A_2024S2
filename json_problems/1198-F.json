    "statement": "F. GCD Groups 2time limit per test0.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers. You need to split all integers into two groups so that the GCD of all integers in the first group is equal to one and the GCD of all integers in the second group is equal to one.The GCD of a group of integers is the largest non-negative integer that divides all the integers in the group.Both groups have to be non-empty.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\\\\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array.OutputIn the first line print \"YES\" (without quotes), if it is possible to split the integers into two groups as required, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.If it is possible to split the integers, in the second line print $$$n$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th integer is equal to $$$1$$$ if the integer $$$a_i$$$ should be in the first group, and $$$2$$$ otherwise.If there are multiple solutions, print any.ExamplesInput4 2 3 6 7OutputYES 2 2 1 1Input5 6 15 35 77 22OutputYES 2 1 2 1 1Input5 6 10 15 1000 75OutputNO",
