Multi-judge Solvingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMakes solves problems on Decoforces and lots of other different online judges. Each problem is denoted by its difficulty — a positive integer number. Difficulties are measured the same across all the judges (the problem with difficultydon Decoforces is as hard as the problem with difficultydon any other judge).Makes has chosennproblems to solve on Decoforces with difficultiesa1,a2, ...,an. He can solve these problems in arbitrary order. Though he can solve problemiwith difficultyaionly if he had already solved some problem with difficulty(no matter on what online judge was it).Before starting this chosen list of problems, Makes has already solved problems with maximum difficultyk.With given conditions it's easy to see that Makes sometimes can't solve all the chosen problems, no matter what order he chooses. So he wants to solve some problems on other judges to finish solving problems from his list.For every positive integerythere exist some problem with difficultyyon at least one judge besides Decoforces.Makes can solve problems on any judge at any time, it isn't necessary to do problems from the chosen list one right after another.Makes doesn't have too much free time, so he asked you to calculate the minimum number of problems he should solve on other judges in order to solve all the chosen problems from Decoforces.InputThe first line contains two integer numbersn,k(1 ≤n≤ 103,1 ≤k≤ 109).The second line containsnspace-separated integer numbersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109).OutputPrint minimum number of problems Makes should solve on other judges in order to solve all chosen problems on Decoforces.ExamplesInput3 32 1 9Output1Input4 2010 3 6 3Output0NoteIn the first example Makes at first solves problems1and2. Then in order to solve the problem with difficulty9, he should solve problem with difficulty no less than5. The only available are difficulties5and6on some other judge. Solving any of these will give Makes opportunity to solve problem3.In the second example he can solve every problem right from the start.",
