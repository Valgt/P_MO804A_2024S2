    "statement": "C. Amr and Chemistrytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAmr loves Chemistry, and specially doing experiments. He is preparing for a new interesting experiment.Amr hasndifferent types of chemicals. Each chemicalihas an initial volume ofailiters. For this experiment, Amr has to mix all the chemicals together, but all the chemicals volumes must be equal first. So his task is to make all the chemicals volumes equal.To do this, Amr can do two different kind of operations.Choose some chemicaliand double its current volume so the new volume will be2aiChoose some chemicaliand divide its volume by two (integer division) so the new volume will beSuppose that each chemical is contained in a vessel of infinite volume. Now Amr wonders what is the minimum number of operations required to make all the chemicals volumes equal?InputThe first line contains one numbern(1 ≤n≤ 105), the number of chemicals.The second line containsnspace separated integersai(1 ≤ai≤ 105), representing the initial volume of thei-th chemical in liters.OutputOutput one integer the minimum number of operations required to make all the chemicals volumes equal.ExamplesInput34 8 2Output2Input33 5 6Output5NoteIn the first sample test, the optimal solution is to divide the second chemical volume by two, and multiply the third chemical volume by two to make all the volumes equal4.In the second sample test, the optimal solution is to divide the first chemical volume by two, and divide the second and the third chemical volumes by two twice to make all the volumes equal1.",
