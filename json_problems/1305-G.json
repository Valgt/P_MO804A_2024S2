    "statement": "G. Kuroni and Antihypetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKuroni isn't good at economics. So he decided to found a new financial pyramid calledAntihype. It has the following rules:You can join the pyramid for free and get $$$0$$$ coins.If you are already a member of Antihype, you can invite your friend who is currently not a member of Antihype, and get a number of coins equal to your age (for each friend you invite).$$$n$$$ people have heard about Antihype recently, the $$$i$$$-th person's age is $$$a_i$$$. Some of them are friends, but friendship is a weird thing now: the $$$i$$$-th person is a friend of the $$$j$$$-th personif and only if$$$a_i \\\\text{ AND } a_j = 0$$$, where $$$\\\\text{AND}$$$ denotes thebitwise AND operation.Nobody among the $$$n$$$ people is a member of Antihype at the moment. They want to cooperate to join and invite each other to Antihype in a way that maximizes their combined gainings. Could you help them?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$)  — the number of people.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\\\\le a_i \\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$)  — the ages of the people.OutputOutput exactly one integer  — the maximum possible combined gainings of all $$$n$$$ people.ExampleInput3 1 2 3Output2NoteOnly the first and second persons are friends. The second can join Antihype and invite the first one, getting $$$2$$$ for it.",
