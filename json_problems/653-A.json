    "statement": "A. Bear and Three Ballstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLimak is a little polar bear. He hasnballs, thei-th ball has sizeti.Limak wants to give one ball to each of his three friends. Giving gifts isn't easy — there are two rules Limak must obey to make friends happy:No two friends can get balls of the same size.No two friends can get balls of sizes that differ by more than2.For example, Limak can choose balls with sizes4,5and3, or balls with sizes90,91and92. But he can't choose balls with sizes5,5and6(two friends would get balls of the same size), and he can't choose balls with sizes30,31and33(because sizes30and33differ by more than2).Your task is to check whether Limak can choose three balls that satisfy conditions above.InputThe first line of the input contains one integern(3 ≤n≤ 50) — the number of balls Limak has.The second line containsnintegerst1,t2, ...,tn(1 ≤ti≤ 1000) wheretidenotes the size of thei-th ball.OutputPrint \"YES\" (without quotes) if Limak can choose three balls of distinct sizes, such that any two of them differ by no more than2. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).ExamplesInput418 55 16 17OutputYESInput640 41 43 44 44 44OutputNOInput85 972 3 4 1 4 970 971OutputYESNoteIn the first sample, there are4balls and Limak is able to choose three of them to satisfy the rules. He must must choose balls with sizes18,16and17.In the second sample, there is no way to give gifts to three friends without breaking the rules.In the third sample, there is even more than one way to choose balls:Choose balls with sizes3,4and5.Choose balls with sizes972,970,971.",
