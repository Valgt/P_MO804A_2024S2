Good Subarraytime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$.Let's call an arraygoodif it can be obtained using the following algorithm: create an array consisting of any single integer; and then perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times: choose an element from the already existing array (let's call it $$$x$$$) and add $$$x$$$, $$$(x-1)$$$, or $$$(x+1)$$$ to the end of the array.For example, the arrays $$$[1, 2, 1]$$$, $$$[5]$$$ and $$$[3, 2, 1, 4]$$$ are good, while $$$[2, 4]$$$ and $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$ are not.Your task is to count the number of goodcontiguoussubarrays of the array $$$a$$$. Two subarrays that have the same elements but are in different positions of the array $$$a$$$ are considered different.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$ 1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n)$$$.Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the number of goodcontiguoussubarrays of the array $$$a$$$.ExampleInput431 1 343 2 3 11184 5 6 5 3 2 3 1Output4 9 1 23NoteIn the first example, the following four subarrays are good:from the $$$1$$$-st to the $$$1$$$-st element;from the $$$1$$$-st to the $$$2$$$-nd element;from the $$$2$$$-nd to the $$$2$$$-nd element;from the $$$3$$$-rd to the $$$3$$$-rd element.In the second example, the only subarray which isnotgood is the subarray from the $$$3$$$-rd element to the $$$4$$$-th element.",
