Here's one of them.You are given two integerslandr. Let's consider the values offor all pairs of integersaandb(l≤a≤b≤r). Your task is to find the maximum value among all considered ones.Expressionmeans applying bitwise excluding or operation to integersxandy. The given operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in languagesC++ andJavait is represented as \"^\", inPascal— as \"xor\".InputThe single line contains space-separated integerslandr(1 ≤l≤r≤ 1018).Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.OutputIn a single line print a single integer — the maximum value offor all pairs of integersa,b(l≤a≤b≤r).ExamplesInput1 2Output3Input8 16Output31Input1 1Output0",
