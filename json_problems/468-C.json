You are to calculateOf course Little X has solved this problem quickly, has locked it, and then has tried to hack others. He has seen the following C++ code:ans = solve(l, r) % a;if (ans <= 0)ans += a;This code will fail only on the test with. You are given numbera, help Little X to find a proper test for hack.InputThe first line contains a single integera(1 ≤a≤ 1018).OutputPrint two integers:l,r(1 ≤l≤r< 10200)— the required test data.
