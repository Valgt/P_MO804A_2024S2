Clique Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe clique problem is one of the most well-known NP-complete problems. Under some simplification it can be formulated as follows. Consider an undirected graphG. It is required to find a subset of verticesCof the maximum size such that any two of them are connected by an edge in graphG. Sounds simple, doesn't it? Nobody yet knows an algorithm that finds a solution to this problem in polynomial time of the size of the graph. However, as with many other NP-complete problems, the clique problem is easier if you consider a specific type of a graph.Considerndistinct points on a line. Let thei-th point have the coordinatexiand weightwi. Let's form graphG, whose vertices are these points and edges connect exactly the pairs of points(i,j), such that the distance between them is not less than the sum of their weights, or more formally:|xi-xj| ≥wi+wj.Find the size of the maximum clique in such graph.InputThe first line contains the integern(1 ≤n≤ 200 000) — the number of points.Each of the nextnlines contains two numbersxi,wi(0 ≤xi≤ 109, 1 ≤wi≤ 109) — the coordinate and the weight of a point. Allxiare different.OutputPrint a single number — the number of vertexes in the maximum clique of the given graph.ExamplesInput42 33 16 10 2Output3NoteIf you happen to know how to solve this problem without using the specific properties of the graph formulated in the problem statement, then you are able to get a prize of one million dollars!The picture for the sample test.",
