Each query consists of three integers $$$p$$$, $$$q$$$ and $$$b$$$. You need to answer whether the result of $$$p/q$$$ in notation with base $$$b$$$ is a finite fraction.A fraction in notation with base $$$b$$$ is finite if it contains finite number of numerals after the decimal point. It is also possible that a fraction has zero numerals after the decimal point.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.Next $$$n$$$ lines contain queries, one per line. Each line contains three integers $$$p$$$, $$$q$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le p \\\\le 10^{18}$$$, $$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 10^{18}$$$, $$$2 \\\\le b \\\\le 10^{18}$$$). All numbers are given in notation with base $$$10$$$.OutputFor each question, in a separate line, printFiniteif the fraction is finite andInfiniteotherwise.ExamplesInput26 12 104 3 10OutputFiniteInfiniteInput41 1 29 36 24 12 33 5 4OutputFiniteFiniteFiniteInfiniteNote$$$\\\\frac{6}{12} = \\\\frac{1}{2} = 0,5_{10}$$$$$$\\\\frac{4}{3} = 1,(3)_{10}$$$$$$\\\\frac{9}{36} = \\\\frac{1}{4} = 0,01_2$$$$$$\\\\frac{4}{12} = \\\\frac{1}{3} = 0,1_3$$$",
