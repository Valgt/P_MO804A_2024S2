Geniustime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test32 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPlease note the non-standard memory limit.There are $$$n$$$ problems numbered with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. $$$i$$$-th problem has the complexity $$$c_i = 2^i$$$, tag $$$tag_i$$$ and score $$$s_i$$$.After solving the problem $$$i$$$ it's allowed to solve problem $$$j$$$ if and only if $$$\\\\text{IQ} < |c_i - c_j|$$$ and $$$tag_i \\\\neq tag_j$$$. After solving it your $$$\\\\text{IQ}$$$ changes and becomes $$$\\\\text{IQ} = |c_i - c_j|$$$ and you gain $$$|s_i - s_j|$$$ points.Any problem can be the first. You can solve problems in any order and as many times as you want.Initially your $$$\\\\text{IQ} = 0$$$. Find the maximum number of points that can be earned.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100)$$$  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5000)$$$  — the number of problems.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$tag_1, tag_2, \\\\ldots, tag_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le tag_i \\\\le n)$$$  — tags of the problems.The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le s_i \\\\le 10^9)$$$  — scores of the problems.It's guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.OutputFor each test case print a single integer  — the maximum number of points that can be earned.ExampleInput5 4 1 2 3 4 5 10 15 20 4 1 2 1 2 5 10 15 20 4 2 2 4 1 2 8 19 1 2 1 1 6 9 1 1 666Output35 30 42 0 0NoteIn the first test case optimal sequence of solving problems is as follows:$$$1 \\\\rightarrow 2$$$, after that total score is $$$5$$$ and $$$\\\\text{IQ} = 2$$$$$$2 \\\\rightarrow 3$$$, after that total score is $$$10$$$ and $$$\\\\text{IQ} = 4$$$$$$3 \\\\rightarrow 1$$$, after that total score is $$$20$$$ and $$$\\\\text{IQ} = 6$$$$$$1 \\\\rightarrow 4$$$, after that total score is $$$35$$$ and $$$\\\\text{IQ} = 14$$$In the second test case optimal sequence of solving problems is as follows:$$$1 \\\\rightarrow 2$$$, after that total score is $$$5$$$ and $$$\\\\text{IQ} = 2$$$$$$2 \\\\rightarrow 3$$$, after that total score is $$$10$$$ and $$$\\\\text{IQ} = 4$$$$$$3 \\\\rightarrow 4$$$, after that total score is $$$15$$$ and $$$\\\\text{IQ} = 8$$$$$$4 \\\\rightarrow 1$$$, after that total score is $$$35$$$ and $$$\\\\text{IQ} = 14$$$In the third test case optimal sequence of solving problems is as follows:$$$1 \\\\rightarrow 3$$$, after that total score is $$$17$$$ and $$$\\\\text{IQ} = 6$$$$$$3 \\\\rightarrow 4$$$, after that total score is $$$35$$$ and $$$\\\\text{IQ} = 8$$$$$$4 \\\\rightarrow 2$$$, after that total score is $$$42$$$ and $$$\\\\text{IQ} = 12$$$",
