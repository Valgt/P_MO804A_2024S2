Contrast Valuetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor an array of integers $$$[a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n]$$$, let's call the value $$$|a_1-a_2|+|a_2-a_3|+\\\\cdots+|a_{n-1}-a_n|$$$ thecontrastof the array. Note that the contrast of an array of size $$$1$$$ is equal to $$$0$$$.You are given an array of integers $$$a$$$. Your task is to build an array of $$$b$$$ in such a way that all the following conditions are met:$$$b$$$ is not empty, i.e there is at least one element;$$$b$$$ is a subsequence of $$$a$$$, i.e $$$b$$$ can be produced by deleting some elements from $$$a$$$ (maybe zero);the contrast of $$$b$$$ is equal to the contrast of $$$a$$$.What is the minimum possible size of the array $$$b$$$?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\cdot, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — elements of the array itself.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible size of the array $$$b$$$.ExampleInput451 3 3 3 724 241 1 1 175 4 2 1 0 0 4Output2 2 1 3",
