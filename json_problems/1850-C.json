Each character in the grid is either $$$\\\\texttt{.}$$$ (representing a dot) or a lowercase Latin letter ($$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$–$$$\\\\texttt{z}$$$).The word lies entirely in a single column and is continuous from the beginning to the ending (without gaps). See the sample input for better understanding.OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing the word made up of lowercase Latin letters ($$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$–$$$\\\\texttt{z}$$$) that is written vertically in one column from top to bottom.ExampleInput5...................................i.....................................l.......o.......s.......t....................................................................t.......h.......e................................................g.......a.......m.......ea.......a.......a.......a.......a.......a.......a.......a.......Outputi lost the game aaaaaaaa",
