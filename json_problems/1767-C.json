You have to calculate the number of binary (consisting of characters0and/or1) strings $$$s$$$ meeting the following constraints.For every pair of integers $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le j \\\\le n$$$, an integer $$$a_{i,j}$$$ is given. It imposes the following constraint on the string $$$s_i s_{i+1} s_{i+2} \\\\dots s_j$$$:if $$$a_{i,j} = 1$$$, all characters in $$$s_i s_{i+1} s_{i+2} \\\\dots s_j$$$ should be the same;if $$$a_{i,j} = 2$$$, there should be at least two different characters in $$$s_i s_{i+1} s_{i+2} \\\\dots s_j$$$;if $$$a_{i,j} = 0$$$, there are no additional constraints on the string $$$s_i s_{i+1} s_{i+2} \\\\dots s_j$$$.Count the number of binary strings $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ meeting the aforementioned constraints. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$).Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains $$$n-i+1$$$ integers $$$a_{i,i}, a_{i,i+1}, a_{i,i+2}, \\\\dots, a_{i,n}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_{i,j} \\\\le 2$$$).OutputPrint one integer â€” the number of strings meeting the constraints, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExamplesInput3 1 0 2 1 0 1Output6Input3 1 1 2 1 0 1Output2Input3 1 2 1 1 0 1Output0Input3 2 0 2 0 1 1Output0NoteIn the first example, the strings meeting the constraints are001,010,011,100,101,110.In the second example, the strings meeting the constraints are001,110.",
