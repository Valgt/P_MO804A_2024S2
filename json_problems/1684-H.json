    "statement": "H. Hard Cuttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a binary string $$$s$$$. You have to cut it into any number of non-intersecting substrings, so that the sum of binary integers denoted by these substrings is a power of 2. Each element of $$$s$$$ should be in exactly one substring.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows.Each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 10^6$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case output the answer to the problem as follows:If the answer does not exist, output $$$-1$$$.If the answer exists, firstly output an integer $$$k$$$ — the number of substrings in the answer. After that output $$$k$$$ non-intersecting substrings, for $$$i$$$-th substring output two integers $$$l_i, r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i, r_i \\\\le |s|$$$) — the description of $$$i$$$-th substring.If there are multiple valid solutions, you can output any of them.ExampleInput4 00000 01101 0111011001011 000111100111110Output-1  3 1 3 4 4 5 5  8 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 6 7 7 8 10 11 12 13 13  5 1 5 6 7 8 11 12 14 15 15NoteIn the first test case it is impossible to cut the string into substrings, so that the sum is a power of 2.In the second test case such cut is valid:$$$011_2 = 3_{10}$$$,$$$0_2 = 0_{10}$$$,$$$1_2 = 1_{10}$$$.$$$3 + 0 + 1 = 4$$$, $$$4$$$ is a power of 2.",
