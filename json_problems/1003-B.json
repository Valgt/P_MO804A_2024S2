Binary String Constructingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$x$$$. Your task is to construct a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n = a + b$$$ such that there are exactly $$$a$$$ zeroes, exactly $$$b$$$ ones and exactly $$$x$$$ indices $$$i$$$ (where $$$1 \\\\le i < n$$$) such that $$$s_i \\\\ne s_{i + 1}$$$. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.For example, for the string \"01010\" there are four indices $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le i < n$$$ and $$$s_i \\\\ne s_{i + 1}$$$ ($$$i = 1, 2, 3, 4$$$). For the string \"111001\" there are two such indices $$$i$$$ ($$$i = 3, 5$$$).Recall that binary string is a non-empty sequence of characters where each character is either0or1.InputThe first line of the input contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 100, 1 \\\\le x < a + b)$$$.OutputPrint only one string $$$s$$$, where $$$s$$$ isanybinary string satisfying conditions described above.
