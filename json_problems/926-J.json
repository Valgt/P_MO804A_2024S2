Segmentstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a straight line colored in white.nblack segments are added on it one by one.After each segment is added, determine the number of connected components of black segments (i. e. the number of black segments in the union of the black segments).In particular, if one segment ends in a pointx, and another segment starts in the pointx, these two segments belong to the same connected component.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 200 000) — the number of segments.Thei-th of the nextnlines contains two integersliandri(1 ≤li<ri≤ 109) — the coordinates of the left and the right ends of thei-th segment. The segments are listed in the order they are added on the white line.OutputPrintnintegers — the number of connected components of black segments after each segment is added.ExamplesInput31 34 52 4Output1 2 1Input910 2050 6030 4070 8090 10060 7010 4040 5080 90Output1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1NoteIn the first example there are two components after the addition of the first two segments, because these segments do not intersect. The third added segment intersects the left segment and touches the right segment at the point4(these segments belong to the same component, according to the statements). Thus the number of connected components of black segments is equal to1after that.",
