Special Characterstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer $$$n$$$.Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be exactly $$$n$$$ special characters in this string. Let's call a characterspecialif it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.For example, there are $$$6$$$ special characters in theAAABAACCstring (at positions: $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$7$$$ and $$$8$$$).Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 50$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer as follows:if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the stringNO;otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the stringYES; on the second line print a string of lengthat most $$$200$$$— the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most $$$200$$$). If there are several solutions, print any of them.ExampleInput3612OutputYES AAABAACC NO YES MM",
