Making Anti-Palindromestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters. In one operation, you are allowed to swap any two characters of the string $$$s$$$.A string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is called ananti-palindrome, if $$$s[i] \\\\ne s[n - i + 1]$$$ for every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$). For example, the strings\"codeforces\",\"string\"areanti-palindromes, but the strings\"abacaba\",\"abc\",\"test\"are not.Determine the minimum number of operations required to make the string $$$s$$$ ananti-palindrome, or output $$$-1$$$, if this is not possible.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase English letters.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations required to make the string $$$s$$$ ananti-palindrome, or $$$-1$$$ if this is not possible.ExampleInput1010codeforces3abc10taarrrataa10dcbdbdcccc4wwww12cabbaccabaac10aadaaaaddc14aacdaaaacadcdc6abccba12dcbcaebacccdOutput0 -1 1 1 -1 3 -1 2 2 2NoteIn the first test case, the string\"codeforces\"is already ananti-palindrome, so the answer is $$$0$$$.In the second test case, it can be shown that the string\"abc\"cannot be transformed into ananti-palindromeby performing the allowed operations, so the answer is $$$-1$$$.In the third test case, it is enough to swap the second and the fifth characters of the string\"taarrrataa\", and the new string\"trararataa\"will be ananti-palindrome, so the answer is $$$1$$$.",
