Orraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ nonnegative integers.Let's define the prefix OR array $$$b$$$ as the array $$$b_i = a_1~\\\\mathsf{OR}~a_2~\\\\mathsf{OR}~\\\\dots~\\\\mathsf{OR}~a_i$$$, where $$$\\\\mathsf{OR}$$$ represents thebitwise OR operation. In other words, the array $$$b$$$ is formed by computing the $$$\\\\mathsf{OR}$$$ of every prefix of $$$a$$$.You are asked to rearrange the elements of the array $$$a$$$ in such a way that its prefix OR array is lexicographically maximum.An array $$$x$$$ is lexicographically greater than an array $$$y$$$ if in the first position where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ differ, $$$x_i > y_i$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$nonnegativeintegers $$$a_1, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print $$$n$$$ integers — any rearrangement of the array $$$a$$$ that obtains the lexicographically maximum prefix OR array.ExampleInput541 2 4 875 1 2 3 4 5 521 10162 3 4 2 3 481 4 2 3 4 5 7 1Output8 4 2 1  5 2 1 3 4 5 5  101 1  4 3 2 2 3 4  7 1 4 2 3 4 5 1",
