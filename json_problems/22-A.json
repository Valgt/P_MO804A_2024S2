Second Order Statisticstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutOnce Bob needed to find the second order statistics of a sequence of integer numbers. Lets choose each number from the sequence exactly once and sort them. The value on the second position is the second order statistics of the given sequence. In other words it is the smallest element strictly greater than the minimum. Help Bob solve this problem.InputThe first input line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — amount of numbers in the sequence. The second line containsnspace-separated integer numbers — elements of the sequence. These numbers don't exceed 100 in absolute value.OutputIf the given sequence has the second order statistics, output this order statistics, otherwise outputNO.ExamplesInput41 2 2 -4Output1Input51 2 3 1 1Output2",
