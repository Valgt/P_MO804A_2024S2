    "statement": "E. Alternating Stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSakurako really lovesalternating strings. She calls a string $$$s$$$ of lowercase Latin letters analternating stringif characters in the even positions are the same, if characters in the odd positions are the same, and the length of the string iseven.For example, the strings 'abab' and 'gg' arealternating, while the strings 'aba' and 'ggwp' are not.As a good friend, you decided to gift such a string, but you couldn't find one. Luckily, you can perform two types of operations on the string:Choose an index $$$i$$$ and delete the $$$i$$$-th character from the string, which will reduce the length of the string by $$$1$$$. This type of operation can be performedno more than $$$1$$$ time;Choose an index $$$i$$$ and replace $$$s_i$$$ with any other letter.Since you are in a hurry, you need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the string analternatingone.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n\\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$)  — the length of the string.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations required to turn the string $$$s$$$ into analternatingone.ExampleInput101a2ca3aab5ababa6acdada9ejibmyyju6bbccbc6abacba5bcbca5dcbdbOutput1 0 1 1 2 6 2 3 1 1NoteFor the stringababa, you can delete the first character to getbaba, which is analternatingstring.For the stringacdada, you can change the first two characters to getdadada, which is analternatingstring.",
