Zbazi in Zeydabadtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA tourist wants to visit country Zeydabad for Zbazi (a local game in Zeydabad).The country Zeydabad is a rectangular table consisting ofnrows andmcolumns. Each cell on the country is either'z'or'.'.The tourist knows this country is named Zeydabad because there are lots of ''Z-pattern\"s in the country. A ''Z-pattern\" is a square which anti-diagonal is completely filled with'z'and its upper and lower rows are also completely filled with'z'. All other cells of a square can be arbitrary.Note that a ''Z-pattern\" can consist of only one cell (see the examples).So he wants to count the number of ''Z-pattern\"s in the country (a necessary skill for Zbazi).Now your task is to help tourist with counting number of ''Z-pattern\"s.As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to usegets/scanf/printfinstead ofgetline/cin/coutin C++, prefer to useBufferedReader/PrintWriterinstead ofScanner/System.outinJava.InputThe first line contains two integersn,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 3000) — the number of rows and columns respectively.Each of the nextnlines containsmcharacters'z'or'.'— the description of Zeydabad.OutputPrint the only integera— the number of ''Z-pattern\"s in Zeydabad.ExamplesInput4 4zzzzzzz..z..zzzzOutput16Input1 4z.z.Output2Input2 2zzzzOutput5",
