So before he goes to bed, Simon wants to complete all chores in the house.Simon's house looks like a rectangular table consisting ofnrows andncolumns from above. All rows of the table are numbered from1tonfrom top to bottom. All columns of the table are numbered from1tonfrom left to right. Each cell of the table is a room. Pair(x,y)denotes the room, located at the intersection of thex-th row and they-th column. For each room we know if the light is on or not there.Initially Simon is in room(x0,y0). He wants to turn off the lights in all the rooms in the house, and then return to room(x0,y0). Suppose that at the current moment Simon is in the room(x,y). To reach the desired result, he can perform the following steps:The format of the action is \"1\". The action is to turn on the light in room(x,y). Simon cannot do it if the room already has light on.The format of the action is \"2\". The action is to turn off the light in room(x,y). Simon cannot do it if the room already has light off.The format of the action is \"dir\" (diris a character). The action is to move to a side-adjacent room in directiondir. The direction can be left, right, up or down (the corresponding dir isL,R,UorD). Additionally, Simon can move only if he see a light in the directiondir. More formally, if we represent the room, Simon wants to go, as(nx,ny), there shold be an integerk(k> 0), that room(x+ (nx-x)k,y+ (ny-y)k)has a light. Of course, Simon cannot move out of his house.Help Simon, find the sequence of actions that lets him achieve the desired result.InputThe first line contains three positive integersn,x0,y0(2 ≤n≤ 500, 1 ≤x0,y0≤n).Nextnlines contain the description of rooms in the house. Thei-th line containsnspace-separated integersai1,ai2, ...,ain. If numberaijequals zero, then room(i,j)has light off, and if numberaijequals one, then room(i,j)has light on. It is guaranteed that at least one room has light on.OutputIf there is no desired sequence of actions, print \"NO\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print \"YES\" (without the quotes) and the description of the required sequence of actions as a string. Note that you do not have to minimize the length of the sequence of actions but you shouldn't use more than3·106actions.ExamplesInput3 1 11 0 00 1 01 0 0OutputYESD1R2L2D2UU2Input3 1 11 0 00 1 00 0 1OutputNO",
