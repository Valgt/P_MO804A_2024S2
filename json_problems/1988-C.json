Find thelongestsequence of positive integers $$$a=[a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_k]$$$ that satisfies the following conditions, and print the sequence:$$$a_i\\\\le n$$$ for all $$$1\\\\le i\\\\le k$$$.$$$a$$$ is strictly increasing. That is, $$$a_i>a_{i-1}$$$ for all $$$2\\\\le i\\\\le k$$$.$$$a_i\\\\,|\\\\,a_{i-1}=n$$$ for all $$$2\\\\le i\\\\le k$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes thebitwise OR operation.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 10^{18}$$$).It's guaranteed that the sum of lengths of the longest valid sequences does not exceed $$$5\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print two lines. In the first line, print the length of your constructed sequence, $$$k$$$. In the second line, print $$$k$$$ positive integers, denoting the sequence. If there are multiple longest sequences, you can print any of them.ExampleInput4131423Output1 1 3 1 2 3 4 4 10 12 14 5 7 18 21 22 23",
