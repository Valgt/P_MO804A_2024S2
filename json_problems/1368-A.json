    "statement": "A. C+=time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLeo has developed a new programming language C+=. In C+=, integer variables can only be changed with a \"+=\" operation that adds the right-hand side value to the left-hand side variable. For example, performing \"a += b\" whena =$$$2$$$,b =$$$3$$$ changes the value ofato $$$5$$$ (the value ofbdoes not change).In a prototype program Leo has two integer variablesaandb, initialized with some positive values. He can perform any number of operations \"a += b\" or \"b += a\". Leo wants to test handling large integers, so he wants to make the value of eitheraorbstrictly greaterthan a given value $$$n$$$. What is the smallest number of operations he has to perform?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.Each of the following $$$T$$$ lines describes a single test case, and contains three integers $$$a, b, n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a, b \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — initial values ofaandb, and the value one of the variables has to exceed, respectively.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the smallest number of operations needed. Separate answers with line breaks.ExampleInput2 1 2 3 5 4 100Output2 7NoteIn the first case we cannot make a variable exceed $$$3$$$ in one operation. One way of achieving this in two operations is to perform \"b += a\" twice.",
