    "statement": "E1. Rubik's Cube Coloring (easy version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt is the easy version of the problem. The difference is that in this version, there are no nodes with already chosen colors.Theofanis is starving, and he wants to eat his favorite food, sheftalia. However, he should first finish his homework. Can you help him with this problem?You have aperfectbinary tree of $$$2^k - 1$$$ nodes — a binary tree where all vertices $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^{k - 1} - 1$$$ have exactly two children: vertices $$$2i$$$ and $$$2i + 1$$$. Vertices from $$$2^{k - 1}$$$ to $$$2^k - 1$$$ don't have any children. You want to color its vertices with the $$$6$$$ Rubik's cube colors (White, Green, Red, Blue, Orange and Yellow).Let's call a coloringgoodwhen all edges connect nodes with colors that areneighboringsides in the Rubik's cube.A picture of Rubik's cube and its 2D map.More formally:a white node cannotbe neighboring with white and yellow nodes;a yellow node cannotbe neighboring with white and yellow nodes;a green node cannotbe neighboring with green and blue nodes;a blue node cannotbe neighboring with green and blue nodes;a red node cannotbe neighboring with red and orange nodes;an orange node cannotbe neighboring with red and orange nodes;You want to calculate the number of the good colorings of the binary tree. Two colorings are considered different if at least one node is colored with a different color.The answer may be too large, so output the answer modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputThe first and only line contains the integers $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 60$$$) — the number of levels in the perfect binary tree you need to color.OutputPrint one integer — the number of the different colorings modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.ExamplesInput3Output24576Input14Output934234NoteIn the picture below, you can see one of the correct colorings of the first example.",
