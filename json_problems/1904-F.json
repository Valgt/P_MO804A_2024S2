Each node is then assigned a value. Lunchbox considers the tree to be beautiful if each value is distinct and ranges from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. In addition, a beautiful tree must also satisfy $$$m$$$ requirements of $$$2$$$ types:\"1 a b c\" — The node with the smallest value on the path between nodes $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ must be located at $$$c$$$.\"2 a b c\" — The node with the largest value on the path between nodes $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ must be located at $$$c$$$.Now, you must assign values to each node such that the resulting tree is beautiful. If it is impossible to do so, output $$$-1$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contain two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u, v \\\\le n, u \\\\ne v$$$) — denoting an edge between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.The next $$$m$$$ lines each contain four integers $$$t$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ ($$$t \\\\in \\\\{1,2\\\\}$$$, $$$1 \\\\le a, b, c \\\\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that node $$$c$$$ is on the path between nodes $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.OutputIf it is impossible to assign values such that the tree is beautiful, output $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, output $$$n$$$ integers, the $$$i$$$-th of which denotes the value of node $$$i$$$.ExamplesInput7 5 1 2 1 3 1 4 3 5 4 6 3 7 1 6 5 1 2 6 7 3 1 2 7 1 1 7 5 7 2 4 2 2Output1 6 7 5 3 4 2Input2 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 2Output-1",
