Each sequence consists of positive integers, not exceedingm. All integers in one sequence are distinct, but the same integer may appear in multiple sequences. The length of thei-th sequence iski.Each second integers in each of the sequences are shifted by one to the left, i.e. integers at positionsi> 1go to positionsi- 1, while the first integers becomes the last.Each second we take the first integer of each sequence and write it down to a new array. Then, for each valuexfrom1tomwe compute the longestsegmentof the array consisting of elementxonly.The above operation is performed for10100seconds. For each integer from1tomfind out the longest segment found at this time.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 100 000) — the number of sequences and the maximum integer that can appear in the sequences.Then follownlines providing the sequences.
