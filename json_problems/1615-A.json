Closing The Gaptime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ block towers in a row, where tower $$$i$$$ has a height of $$$a_i$$$. You're part of a building crew, and you want to make the buildings look as nice as possible. In a single day, you can perform the following operation:Choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i, j \\\\leq n$$$; $$$i \\\\neq j$$$), and move a block from tower $$$i$$$ to tower $$$j$$$. This essentially decreases $$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$ and increases $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$.You think the ugliness of the buildings is the height difference between the tallest and shortest buildings. Formally, the ugliness is defined as $$$\\\\max(a)-\\\\min(a)$$$.What's the minimum possible ugliness you can achieve, after any number of days?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ cases follow.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of buildings.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^7$$$) — the heights of the buildings.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible ugliness of the buildings.ExampleInput3 3 10 10 10 4 3 2 1 2 5 1 2 3 1 5Output0 0 1NoteIn the first test case, the ugliness is already $$$0$$$.In the second test case, you should do one operation, with $$$i = 1$$$ and $$$j = 3$$$. The new heights will now be $$$[2, 2, 2, 2]$$$, with an ugliness of $$$0$$$.In the third test case, you may do three operations:with $$$i = 3$$$ and $$$j = 1$$$. The new array will now be $$$[2, 2, 2, 1, 5]$$$,with $$$i = 5$$$ and $$$j = 4$$$. The new array will now be $$$[2, 2, 2, 2, 4]$$$,with $$$i = 5$$$ and $$$j = 3$$$. The new array will now be $$$[2, 2, 3, 2, 3]$$$.The resulting ugliness is $$$1$$$. It can be proven that this is the minimum possible ugliness for this test.",
