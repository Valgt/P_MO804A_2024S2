Balanced Subsequencestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA sequence of brackets is called balanced if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters'+'and'1'. For example, sequences'(())()', '()',and'(()(()))'are balanced, while')(', '(()',and'(()))('are not.A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.You are given three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$. Find the number of sequences consisting of $$$n$$$'('and $$$m$$$')', such that the longest balanced subsequence is of length $$$2 \\\\cdot k$$$. Since the answer can be large calculate it modulo $$$1\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,007$$$ ($$$10^9 + 7$$$).InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^3$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m, k \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^3$$$)OutputFor each test case, print one integer â€” the answer to the problem.ExampleInput32 2 23 2 33 2 1Output2 0 4NoteFor the first test case\"()()\", \"(())\"are the $$$2$$$ sequencesFor the second test case no sequence is possible.For the third test case\")((()\", \")(()(\", \")()((\", \"())((\"are the $$$4$$$ sequences.",
