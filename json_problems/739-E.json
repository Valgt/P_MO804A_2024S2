    "statement": "E. Gosha is huntingtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGosha is hunting. His goal is to catch as many Pokemons as possible. Gosha hasaPoke Balls andbUltra Balls. There arenPokemons. They are numbered1throughn. Gosha knows that if he throws a Poke Ball at thei-th Pokemon he catches it with probabilitypi. If he throws an Ultra Ball at thei-th Pokemon he catches it with probabilityui. He can throw at most one Ball of each type at any Pokemon.The hunting proceeds as follows: at first, Gosha chooses no more thanaPokemons at which he will throw Poke Balls and no more thanbPokemons at which he will throw Ultra Balls. After that, he throws the chosen Balls at the chosen Pokemons. If he throws both Ultra Ball and Poke Ball at some Pokemon, he is caught if and only if he is caught by any of these Balls. The outcome of a throw doesn't depend on the other throws.Gosha would like to know what is the expected number of the Pokemons he catches if he acts in an optimal way. In other words, he would like to know the maximum possible expected number of Pokemons can catch.InputThe first line contains three integersn,aandb(2 ≤n≤ 2000,0 ≤a,b≤n) — the number of Pokemons, the number of Poke Balls and the number of Ultra Balls.The second line containsnreal valuesp1,p2, ...,pn(0 ≤pi≤ 1), wherepiis the probability of catching thei-th Pokemon if Gosha throws a Poke Ball to it.The third line containsnreal valuesu1,u2, ...,un(0 ≤ui≤ 1), whereuiis the probability of catching thei-th Pokemon if Gosha throws an Ultra Ball to it.All the probabilities are given with exactly three digits after the decimal separator.OutputPrint the maximum possible expected number of Pokemons Gosha can catch. The answer is considered correct if it's absolute or relative error doesn't exceed10- 4.ExamplesInput3 2 21.000 0.000 0.5000.000 1.000 0.500Output2.75Input4 1 30.100 0.500 0.500 0.6000.100 0.500 0.900 0.400Output2.16Input3 2 00.412 0.198 0.5990.612 0.987 0.443Output1.011",
