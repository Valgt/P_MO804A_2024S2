Interesting Sequencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPetya and his friend, robot Petya++, like to solve exciting math problems.One day Petya++ came up with the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ and wrote the following equality on the board: $$$$$$n\\\\ \\\\&\\\\ (n+1)\\\\ \\\\&\\\\ \\\\dots\\\\ \\\\&\\\\ m = x,$$$$$$ where $$$\\\\&$$$ denotes thebitwise AND operation. Then he suggested his friend Petya find such a minimal $$$m$$$ ($$$m \\\\ge n$$$) that the equality on the board holds.Unfortunately, Petya couldn't solve this problem in his head and decided to ask for computer help. He quickly wrote a program and found the answer.Can you solve this difficult problem?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$0\\\\le n, x \\\\le 10^{18}$$$).OutputFor every test case, output the smallest possible value of $$$m$$$ such that equality holds.If the equality does not hold for any $$$m$$$, print $$$-1$$$ instead.We can show that if the required $$$m$$$ exists, it does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^{18}$$$.ExampleInput510 810 1010 4220 161000000000000000000 0Output12 10 -1 24 1152921504606846976NoteIn the first example, $$$10\\\\ \\\\&\\\\ 11 = 10$$$, but $$$10\\\\ \\\\&\\\\ 11\\\\ \\\\&\\\\ 12 = 8$$$, so the answer is $$$12$$$.In the second example, $$$10 = 10$$$, so the answer is $$$10$$$.In the third example, we can see that the required $$$m$$$ does not exist, so we have to print $$$-1$$$.",
