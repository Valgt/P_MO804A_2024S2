Initially, all elements are white. Chaneka will choose one or more different indices and colour the elements at those chosen indices black. Then, she will choose all white elements whose indices are multiples of the index ofat least oneblack element and colour those elements green. After that, her score is themaximumvalue of $$$a_i$$$ out of all black and green elements.There are $$$2^n-1$$$ ways for Chaneka to choose the black indices. Find the sum of scores for all possible ways Chaneka can choose the black indices. Since the answer can be very big, print the answer modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the size of array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,a_3,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0\\\\leq a_i\\\\leq10^5$$$).OutputAn integer representing the sum of scores for all possible ways Chaneka can choose the black indices, modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.ExamplesInput4 19 14 19 9Output265Input1 0Output0Input15 90000 9000 99000 900 90900 9900 99900 90 90090 9090 99090 990 90990 9990 99990Output266012571NoteIn the first example, below are the $$$15$$$ possible ways to choose the black indices:Index $$$1$$$ is black.
