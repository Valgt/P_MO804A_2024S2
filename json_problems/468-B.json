The following two conditions must be satisfied:If numberxbelongs to setA, then numbera-xmust also belong to setA.If numberxbelongs to setB, then numberb-xmust also belong to setB.Help Little X divide the numbers into two sets or determine that it's impossible.InputThe first line contains three space-separated integersn,a,b(1 ≤n≤ 105; 1 ≤a,b≤ 109).

Then printnintegers:b1,b2, ...,bn(biequals either0, or1), describing the division.
