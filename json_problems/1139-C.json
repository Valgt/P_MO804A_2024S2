Edgy Treestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree (a connected undirected graph without cycles) of $$$n$$$ vertices. Each of the $$$n - 1$$$ edges of the tree is colored in either black or red.You are also given an integer $$$k$$$. Consider sequences of $$$k$$$ vertices. Let's call a sequence $$$[a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k]$$$goodif it satisfies the following criterion:We will walk a path (possibly visiting same edge/vertex multiple times) on the tree, starting from $$$a_1$$$ and ending at $$$a_k$$$.Start at $$$a_1$$$, then go to $$$a_2$$$ using the shortest path between $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_2$$$, then go to $$$a_3$$$ in a similar way, and so on, until you travel the shortest path between $$$a_{k-1}$$$ and $$$a_k$$$.If you walked over at least one black edge during this process, then the sequence is good.Consider the tree on the picture. If $$$k=3$$$ then the following sequences are good: $$$[1, 4, 7]$$$, $$$[5, 5, 3]$$$ and $$$[2, 3, 7]$$$. The following sequences are not good: $$$[1, 4, 6]$$$, $$$[5, 5, 5]$$$, $$$[3, 7, 3]$$$.There are $$$n^k$$$ sequences of vertices, count how many of them are good. Since this number can be quite large, print it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le 100$$$), the size of the tree and the length of the vertex sequence.Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains three integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u_i, v_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$x_i \\\\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\}$$$), where $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ denote the endpoints of the corresponding edge and $$$x_i$$$ is the color of this edge ($$$0$$$ denotes red edge and $$$1$$$ denotes black edge).OutputPrint the number of good sequences modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExamplesInput4 4 1 2 1 2 3 1 3 4 1Output252Input4 6 1 2 0 1 3 0 1 4 0Output0Input3 5 1 2 1 2 3 0Output210NoteIn the first example, all sequences ($$$4^4$$$) of length $$$4$$$exceptthe following are good:$$$[1, 1, 1, 1]$$$$$$[2, 2, 2, 2]$$$$$$[3, 3, 3, 3]$$$$$$[4, 4, 4, 4]$$$In the second example, all edges are red, hence there aren't any good sequences.",
