Overall a permutation hasncyclic shifts.The Little Elephant wonders, for all cyclic shifts of permutationb, what is the distance between the cyclic shift and permutationa?InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 105)— the size of the permutations. The second line contains permutationaasndistinct numbers from 1 ton, inclusive. The numbers are separated with single spaces. The third line contains permutationbin the same format.OutputInnlines printnintegers — the answers for cyclic shifts.
