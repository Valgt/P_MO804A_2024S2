You are given the pseudocode of his solution, where the function getAnswer calculates the answer to the problem:getAnswer(a[1..n], b[1..len], h)answer = 0for i = 1 to n-len+1answer = answer + f(a[i..i+len-1], b, h, 1)return answerf(s[1..len], b[1..len], h, index)if index = len+1 thenreturn 1for i = 1 to lenif s[index] + b[i] >= hmem = b[i]b[i] = 0res = f(s, b, h, index + 1)b[i] = memif res > 0return 1return 0Your task is to help Manao optimize his algorithm.InputThe first line contains space-separated integersn,lenandh(1 ≤len≤n≤ 150000; 1 ≤h≤ 109).
