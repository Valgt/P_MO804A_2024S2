As a member of \"Zimpha fan club\", you decided to solve that problem.You are given two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, respectively. Both strings only consist of lowercase English letters,-and*.You need to replace all occurrences of*and-, observing the following rules:For each-, you must replace it with any lowercase English letter.For each*, you must replace it with a string of any (possibly, zero) length which only consists of lowercase English letters.Note that you can replace two different instances of-with different characters. You can also replace each two different instances of*with different strings.Suppose $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ have been transformed into $$$s'$$$ and $$$t'$$$. Now you're wondering if there's a replacement that makes $$$s'=t'$$$.InputThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, m \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^6$$$) — the length of the strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$, respectively.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$s$$$ only consists of lowercase English letters,-and*.The third line contains the string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$t$$$ only consists of lowercase English letters,-and*.OutputFor each test case, output \"Yes\" if there is a replacement that makes $$$s'=t'$$$, and output \"No\" otherwise.You can output \"Yes\" and \"No\" in any case (for example, strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive response).ExamplesInput10 10justmonikaj-stsayoriOutputNoInput7 8ttk-wxx*tt-l-xxOutputYesInput13 11asoulwangziji-soulg*z-y-OutputNoInput7 3abc*cbaa*cOutputNoInput20 18bulijiojio-dibuliduo*li*ji-*ox*i*-du*-OutputYesNoteIn the second test case, we can transform both strings intottklwxx.
