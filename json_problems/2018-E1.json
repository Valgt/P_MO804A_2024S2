Complex Segments (Easy Version)time limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKen Arai - COMPLEX⠀This is the easy version of the problem. In this version, the constraints on $$$n$$$ and the time limit are lower. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.A set of (closed) segments iscomplexif it can be partitioned into some subsets such thatall the subsets have the same size; anda pair of segments intersectsif and only ifthe two segments are in the same subset.You are given $$$n$$$ segments $$$[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\\\ldots, [l_n, r_n]$$$. Find the maximum size of acomplexsubset of these segments.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of segments.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$l_1, l_2, \\\\ldots, l_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le 2n$$$) — the left endpoints of the segments.The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \\\\ldots, r_n$$$ ($$$l_i \\\\leq r_i \\\\le 2n$$$) — the right endpoints of the segments.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum size of acomplexsubset of the given segments.ExampleInput331 2 35 4 651 2 3 6 85 4 7 9 1053 1 4 1 57 2 6 5 10Output3 4 4NoteIn the first test case, all pairs of segments intersect, therefore it is optimal to form a single group containing all of the three segments.In the second test case, there is no valid partition for all of the five segments. A valid partition with four segments is the following: $$$\\\\{\\\\{ [1, 5], [2, 4] \\\\}, \\\\{ [6, 9], [8, 10] \\\\}\\\\}$$$.In the third test case, it is optimal to make a single group containing all the segments except the second.",
