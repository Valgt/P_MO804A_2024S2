Mister B and Boring Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSometimes Mister B has free evenings when he doesn't know what to do. Fortunately, Mister B found a new game, where the player can play against aliens.All characters in this game are lowercase English letters. There are two players: Mister B and his competitor.Initially the players have a stringsconsisting of the firstaEnglish letters in alphabetical order (for example, ifa= 5, thensequals to \"abcde\").The players take turns appending letters to strings. Mister B moves first.Mister B must append exactlybletters on each his move. He can arbitrary choose these letters. His opponent adds exactlyaletters on each move.Mister B quickly understood that his opponent was just a computer that used a simple algorithm. The computer on each turn considers the suffix of stringsof lengthaand generates a stringtof lengthasuch that all letters in the stringtare distinct and don't appear in the considered suffix. From multiple variants oftlexicographically minimal is chosen (ifa= 4and the suffix is \"bfdd\", the computer chooses stringtequal to \"aceg\"). After that the chosen stringtis appended to the end ofs.Mister B soon found the game boring and came up with the following question: what can be the minimum possible number of different letters in stringson the segment between positionslandr, inclusive. Letters of stringsare numerated starting from1.InputFirst and only line contains four space-separated integers:a,b,landr(1 ≤a,b≤ 12,1 ≤l≤r≤ 109) — the numbers of letters each player appends and the bounds of the segment.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum possible number of different letters in the segment from positionlto positionr, inclusive, in strings.ExamplesInput1 1 1 8Output2Input4 2 2 6Output3Input3 7 4 6Output1NoteIn the first sample test one of optimal strategies generate strings=\"abababab...\", that's why answer is2.In the second sample test strings=\"abcdbcaefg...\" can be obtained, chosen segment will look like \"bcdbc\", that's why answer is3.In the third sample test strings=\"abczzzacad...\" can be obtained, chosen, segment will look like \"zzz\", that's why answer is1.",
