Of course she wants her partner to be clever too (although he's not)! Parmida has prepared the following test problem for Pashmak.There is a sequenceathat consists ofnintegersa1,a2, ...,an. Let's denotef(l,r,x)the number of indicesksuch that:l≤k≤randak=x. His task is to calculate the number of pairs of indiciesi,j(1 ≤i<j≤n)such thatf(1,i,ai) >f(j,n,aj).Help Pashmak with the test.InputThe first line of the input contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 106).
