He was asked to solve the following programming problem by Saitama:The length of some stringsis denoted|s|. The Hamming distance between two stringssandtof equal length is defined as, wheresiis thei-th character ofsandtiis thei-th character oft. For example, the Hamming distance between string \"0011\" and string \"0110\" is|0 - 0| + |0 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 0| = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.Given two binary stringsaandb, find the sum of the Hamming distances betweenaand all contiguous substrings ofbof length|a|.InputThe first line of the input contains binary stringa(1 ≤ |a| ≤ 200 000).The second line of the input contains binary stringb(|a| ≤ |b| ≤ 200 000).Both strings are guaranteed to consist of characters '0' and '1' only.OutputPrint a single integer — the sum of Hamming distances betweenaand all contiguous substrings ofbof length|a|.ExamplesInput0100111Output3Input00110110Output2NoteFor the first sample case, there are four contiguous substrings ofbof length|a|: \"00\", \"01\", \"11\", and \"11\". The distance between \"01\" and \"00\" is|0 - 0| + |1 - 0| = 1. The distance between \"01\" and \"01\" is|0 - 0| + |1 - 1| = 0. The distance between \"01\" and \"11\" is|0 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 1. Last distance counts twice, as there are two occurrences of string \"11\". The sum of these edit distances is1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3.The second sample case is described in the statement.",
