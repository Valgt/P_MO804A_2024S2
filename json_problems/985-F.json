Isomorphic Stringstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a stringsof lengthnconsisting of lowercase English letters.For two given stringssandt, saySis the set of distinct characters ofsandTis the set of distinct characters oft. The stringssandtareisomorphicif their lengths are equal and there is a one-to-one mapping (bijection)fbetweenSandTfor whichf(si) =ti. Formally:f(si) =tifor any indexi,for any characterthere is exactly one characterthatf(x) =y,for any characterthere is exactly one characterthatf(x) =y.For example, the strings \"aababc\" and \"bbcbcz\" are isomorphic. Also the strings \"aaaww\" and \"wwwaa\" are isomorphic. The following pairs of strings are not isomorphic: \"aab\" and \"bbb\", \"test\" and \"best\".You have to handlemqueries characterized by three integersx,y,len(1 ≤x,y≤n-len+ 1). For each query check if two substringss[x...x+len- 1]ands[y...y+len- 1]are isomorphic.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 2·105,1 ≤m≤ 2·105) — the length of the stringsand the number of queries.The second line contains stringsconsisting ofnlowercase English letters.The followingmlines contain a single query on each line:xi,yiandleni(1 ≤xi,yi≤n,1 ≤leni≤n-max(xi,yi) + 1) — the description of the pair of the substrings to check.OutputFor each query in a separate line print \"YES\" if substringss[xi...xi+leni- 1]ands[yi...yi+leni- 1]are isomorphic and \"NO\" otherwise.ExampleInput7 4abacaba1 1 11 4 22 1 32 4 3OutputYESYESNOYESNoteThe queries in the example are following:substrings \"a\" and \"a\" are isomorphic:f(a) =a;substrings \"ab\" and \"ca\" are isomorphic:f(a) =c,f(b) =a;substrings \"bac\" and \"aba\" are not isomorphic sincef(b)andf(c)must be equal toaat same time;substrings \"bac\" and \"cab\" are isomorphic:f(b) =c,f(a) =a,f(c) =b.",
