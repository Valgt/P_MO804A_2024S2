In his site, there arenpages numbered by integers from1ton. Assume that somebody is on thep-th page now. The navigation will look like this:<<p-kp-k+ 1...p- 1(p)p+ 1...p+k- 1p+k>>When someone clicks the button \"<<\" he is redirected to page1, and when someone clicks the button \">>\" he is redirected to pagen. Of course if someone clicks on a number, he is redirected to the corresponding page.There are some conditions in the navigation:If page1is in the navigation, the button \"<<\" must not be printed.If pagenis in the navigation, the button \">>\" must not be printed.If the page number is smaller than1or greater thann, it must not be printed.You can see some examples of the navigations. Make a program that prints the navigation.InputThe first and the only line contains three integersn,p,k(3 ≤n≤ 100;1 ≤p≤n;1 ≤k≤n)OutputPrint the proper navigation.
