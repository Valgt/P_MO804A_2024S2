Fibonacci-ishtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYash has recently learnt about the Fibonacci sequence and is very excited about it. He calls a sequence Fibonacci-ish ifthe sequence consists of at least two elementsf0andf1are arbitraryfn+ 2=fn+ 1+fnfor alln≥ 0.You are given some sequence of integersa1,a2, ...,an. Your task is rearrange elements of this sequence in such a way that its longest possible prefix is Fibonacci-ish sequence.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 1000) — the length of the sequenceai.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(|ai| ≤ 109).OutputPrint the length of the longest possible Fibonacci-ish prefix of the given sequence after rearrangement.ExamplesInput31 2 -1Output3Input528 35 7 14 21Output4NoteIn the first sample, if we rearrange elements of the sequence as- 1,2,1, the whole sequenceaiwould be Fibonacci-ish.In the second sample, the optimal way to rearrange elements is,,,,28.",
