Eligible Segmentstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given $$$n$$$distinctpoints $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ on the plane and a positive integer $$$R$$$.Find the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n$$$, and for every possible $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$) the distance from the point $$$p_k$$$ to thesegmentbetween points $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$ is at most $$$R$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$R$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3000$$$, $$$1 \\\\le R \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of points and the maximum distance between a point and a segment.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le 10^5$$$) that define the $$$i$$$-th point $$$p_i=(x_i, y_i)$$$. All points are distinct.It is guaranteed that the answer does not change if the parameter $$$R$$$ is changed by at most $$$10^{-2}$$$.OutputPrint the number of suitable pairs $$$(i, j)$$$.ExamplesInput4 2 0 1 0 -1 3 0 -3 0Output1Input3 3 1 -1 -1 -1 0 1Output3NoteIn the first example, the only pair of points $$$(-3, 0)$$$, $$$(3, 0)$$$ is suitable. The distance to the segment between these points from the points $$$(0, 1)$$$ and $$$(0, -1)$$$ is equal to $$$1$$$, which is less than $$$R=2$$$.In the second example, all possible pairs of points are eligible.",
