The teacher has given three integers to him:n,mandk, and asked him to mark one or more squares on a square grid of sizen×m.The marked squares must form a connected figure, and there must be exactlyktriples of marked squares that form an L-shaped tromino — all three squares are inside a2 × 2square.The set of squares forms a connected figure if it is possible to get from any square to any other one if you are allowed to move from a square to any adjacent by a common side square.Peter cannot fulfill the task, so he asks you for help. Help him to create such figure.InputInput data contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1 ≤t≤ 100).Each of the followingttest cases is described by a line that contains three integers:n,mandk(3 ≤n,m,n×m≤ 105,0 ≤k≤ 109).The sum of values ofn×mfor all tests in one input data doesn't exceed105.OutputFor each test case print the answer.If it is possible to create such figure, printnlines,mcharacters each, use asterisk '*' to denote the marked square, and dot '.' to denote the unmarked one.If there is no solution, print-1.Print empty line between test cases.ExampleInput33 3 43 3 53 3 3Output.*.***.*.**.**.*...*.****..",
