You can read more about it here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_bid_auction(though you don't have to do it to solve this problem).Let's simplify this game a bit. Formally, there are $$$n$$$ participants, the $$$i$$$-th participant chose the number $$$a_i$$$. The winner of the game is such a participant that the number he chose isunique(i. e. nobody else chose this number except him) and isminimal(i. e. among all unique values of $$$a$$$ the minimum one is the winning one).Your task is to find theindexof the participant who won the game (or-1if there is no winner). Indexing is $$$1$$$-based, i. e. the participants are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of participants. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th participant chosen number.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — theindexof the participant who won the game (or-1if there is no winner).Note that the answer is always unique.ExampleInput6 2 1 1 3 2 1 3 4 2 2 2 3 1 1 5 2 3 2 4 2 6 1 1 5 5 4 4Output-1 2 4 1 2 -1",
