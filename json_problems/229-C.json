Now they study properties of all sorts of graphs together. Alice invented the following task: she takes a complete undirected graph withnvertices, chooses somemedges and keeps them. Bob gets theremaining edges.Alice and Bob are fond of \"triangles\" in graphs, that is, cycles of length 3. That's why they wonder: what total number of triangles is there in the two graphs formed by Alice and Bob's edges, correspondingly?InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 106, 0 ≤m≤ 106) — the number of vertices in the initial complete graph and the number of edges in Alice's graph, correspondingly. Thenmlines follow: thei-th line contains two space-separated integersai,bi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi), — the numbers of the two vertices connected by thei-th edge in Alice's graph. It is guaranteed that Alice's graph contains no multiple edges and self-loops. It is guaranteed that the initial complete graph also contains no multiple edges and self-loops.Consider the graph vertices to be indexed in some way from 1 ton.OutputPrint a single number — the total number of cycles of length 3 in Alice and Bob's graphs together.Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is advised to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.ExamplesInput5 51 21 32 32 43 4Output3Input5 31 22 31 3Output4NoteIn the first sample Alice has 2 triangles: (1, 2, 3) and (2, 3, 4). Bob's graph has only 1 triangle : (1, 4, 5). That's why the two graphs in total contain 3 triangles.In the second sample Alice's graph has only one triangle: (1, 2, 3). Bob's graph has three triangles: (1, 4, 5), (2, 4, 5) and (3, 4, 5). In this case the answer to the problem is 4.",
