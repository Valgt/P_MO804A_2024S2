Each $$$a_i$$$ is one of the six following numbers: $$$4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42$$$.Your task is to remove the minimum number of elements to make this arraygood.An array of length $$$k$$$ is calledgoodif $$$k$$$ is divisible by $$$6$$$ and it is possible to split it into $$$\\\\frac{k}{6}$$$subsequences$$$4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42$$$.Examples of good arrays:$$$[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]$$$ (the whole array is a required sequence);$$$[4, 8, 4, 15, 16, 8, 23, 15, 16, 42, 23, 42]$$$ (the first sequence is formed from first, second, fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth elements and the second one is formed from remaining elements);$$$[]$$$ (the empty array is good).Examples of bad arrays:$$$[4, 8, 15, 16, 42, 23]$$$ (the order of elements should be exactly $$$4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42$$$);$$$[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 4]$$$ (the length of the array is not divisible by $$$6$$$);$$$[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 23]$$$ (the first sequence can be formed from first six elements but the remaining array cannot form the required sequence).InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ (each $$$a_i$$$ is one of the following numbers: $$$4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum number of elements you have to remove to obtain agoodarray.ExamplesInput5 4 8 15 16 23Output5Input12 4 8 4 15 16 8 23 15 16 42 23 42Output0Input15 4 8 4 8 15 16 8 16 23 15 16 4 42 23 42Output3",
