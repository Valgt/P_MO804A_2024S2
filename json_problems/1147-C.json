    "statement": "C. Thanos Nimtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob are playing a game with $$$n$$$ piles of stones. It is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is an even number. The $$$i$$$-th pile has $$$a_i$$$ stones.Alice and Bob will play a game alternating turns with Alice going first.On a player's turn, they must chooseexactly$$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ nonempty piles and independently remove a positive number of stones from each of the chosen piles. Theycanremove adifferentnumber of stones from the piles in a single turn. The first player unable to make a move loses (when there are less than $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ nonempty piles).Given the starting configuration, determine who will win the game.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 50$$$) — the number of piles. It is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is an even number.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 50$$$) — the number of stones in the piles.OutputPrint a single string \"Alice\" if Alice wins; otherwise, print \"Bob\" (without double quotes).ExamplesInput2 8 8OutputBobInput4 3 1 4 1OutputAliceNoteIn the first example, each player can only remove stones from one pile ($$$\\\\frac{2}{2}=1$$$). Alice loses, since Bob can copy whatever Alice does on the other pile, so Alice will run out of moves first.In the second example, Alice can remove $$$2$$$ stones from the first pile and $$$3$$$ stones from the third pile on her first move to guarantee a win.",
