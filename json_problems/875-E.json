    "statement": "E. Delivery Clubtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPetya and Vasya got employed as couriers. During the working day they are to deliver packages tondifferent points on the line. According to the company's internal rules, the delivery of packages must be carried out strictly in a certain order. Initially, Petya is at the point with the coordinates1, Vasya is at the point with the coordinates2, and the clients are at the pointsx1,x2, ...,xnin the order of the required visit.The guys agree in advance who of them will deliver the package to which of the customers, and then they act as follows. When the package for thei-th client is delivered, the one who delivers the package to the(i+ 1)-st client is sent to the path (it can be the same person who went to the pointxi, or the other). The friend who is not busy in delivering the current package, is standing still.To communicate with each other, the guys have got walkie-talkies. The walkie-talkies work rather poorly at great distances, so Petya and Vasya want to distribute the orders so that the maximum distance between them during the day is as low as possible. Help Petya and Vasya to minimize the maximum distance between them, observing all delivery rules.InputThe first line contains three integersn,s1,s2(1 ≤n≤ 100 000,0 ≤s1,s2≤ 109) — number of points of delivery and starting positions of Petya and Vasya.The second line containsnintegersx1,x2, ...,xn— customers coordinates (0 ≤xi≤ 109), in the order to make a delivery.It is guaranteed, that among the numberss1,s2,x1, ...,xnthere are no two equal.OutputOutput the only integer, minimum possible maximal distance between couriers during delivery.ExamplesInput2 0 105 6Output10Input3 2 13 4 5Output1Input1 4 52Output2NoteIn the first test case the initial distance between the couriers is10. This value will be the answer, for example, Petya can perform both deliveries, and Vasya will remain at the starting point.In the second test case you can optimally act, for example, like this: Vasya delivers the package to the first customer, Petya to the second and, finally, Vasya delivers the package to the third client. With this order of delivery, the distance between the couriers will never exceed1.In the third test case only two variants are possible: if the delivery of a single package is carried out by Petya, the maximum distance between them will be5 - 2 = 3. If Vasya will deliver the package, the maximum distance is4 - 2 = 2. The latter method is optimal.",
