He'd like to find three integer points $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$, $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$, $$$(x_3, y_3)$$$, such that $$$0 \\\\le x_1, x_2, x_3 \\\\le n$$$, $$$0 \\\\le y_1, y_2, y_3 \\\\le m$$$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $$$\\\\frac{nm}{k}$$$.Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.InputThe single line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n, m \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputIf there are no such points, print \"NO\".Otherwise print \"YES\" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $$$x_i, y_i$$$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).ExamplesInput4 3 3OutputYES1 02 34 1Input4 4 7OutputNONoteIn the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $$$\\\\frac{nm}{k} = 4$$$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:In the second example there is no triangle with area $$$\\\\frac{nm}{k} = \\\\frac{16}{7}$$$.",
