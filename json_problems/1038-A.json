Equalitytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, which consists only of the first $$$k$$$ letters of the Latin alphabet. All letters in string $$$s$$$ are uppercase.Asubsequenceof string $$$s$$$ is a string that can be derived from $$$s$$$ by deleting some of its symbols without changing the order of the remaining symbols. For example, \"ADE\" and \"BD\" are subsequences of \"ABCDE\", but \"DEA\" is not.A subsequence of $$$s$$$ calledgoodif the number of occurences of each of the first $$$k$$$ letters of the alphabet is the same.Find the length of the longest good subsequence of $$$s$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 26$$$).The second line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. String $$$s$$$ only contains uppercase letters from 'A' to the $$$k$$$-th letter of Latin alphabet.OutputPrint the only integer — the length of the longest good subsequence of string $$$s$$$.ExamplesInput9 3ACAABCCABOutput6Input9 4ABCABCABCOutput0NoteIn the first example, \"ACBCAB\" (\"ACAABCCAB\") is one of the subsequences that has the same frequency of 'A', 'B' and 'C'. Subsequence \"CAB\" also has the same frequency of these letters, but doesn't have the maximum possible length.In the second example, none of the subsequences can have 'D', hence the answer is $$$0$$$.",
