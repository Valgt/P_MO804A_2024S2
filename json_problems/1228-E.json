Another Filling the Gridtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have $$$n \\\\times n$$$ square grid and an integer $$$k$$$. Put an integer in each cell while satisfying the conditions below.All numbers in the grid should be between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$ inclusive.Minimum number of the $$$i$$$-th row is $$$1$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$).Minimum number of the $$$j$$$-th column is $$$1$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le j \\\\le n$$$).Find the number of ways to put integers in the grid. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo $$$(10^{9} + 7)$$$.These are the examples of valid and invalid grid when $$$n=k=2$$$.InputThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 250$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^{9}$$$).OutputPrint the answer modulo $$$(10^{9} + 7)$$$.ExamplesInput2 2Output7Input123 456789Output689974806NoteIn the first example, following $$$7$$$ cases are possible.In the second example, make sure you print the answer modulo $$$(10^{9} + 7)$$$.",
