Vladik and Entertaining Flagstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn his spare time Vladik estimates beauty of the flags.Every flag could be represented as the matrixn×mwhich consists of positive integers.Let's define the beauty of the flag as number of components in its matrix. We call component a set of cells with same numbers and between any pair of cells from that set there exists a path through adjacent cells from same component. Here is the example of the partitioning some flag matrix into components:But this time he decided to change something in the process. Now he wants to estimate not the entire flag, but some segment. Segment of flag can be described as a submatrix of the flag matrix with opposite corners at(1,l)and(n,r), where conditions1 ≤l≤r≤mare satisfied.Help Vladik to calculate the beauty for some segments of the given flag.InputFirst line contains three space-separated integersn,m,q(1 ≤n≤ 10,1 ≤m,q≤ 105) — dimensions of flag matrix and number of segments respectively.Each of nextnlines containsmspace-separated integers — description of flag matrix. All elements of flag matrix is positive integers not exceeding106.Each of nextqlines contains two space-separated integersl,r(1 ≤l≤r≤m) — borders of segment which beauty Vladik wants to know.OutputFor each segment print the result on the corresponding line.ExampleInput4 5 41 1 1 1 11 2 2 3 31 1 1 2 54 4 5 5 51 52 51 24 5Output6734NotePartitioning on components for every segment from first test case:",
