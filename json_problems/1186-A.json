Vus the Cossack and a Contesttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVus theCossackholds a programming competition, in which $$$n$$$ people participate. He decided to award them all with pens and notebooks. It is known that Vus has exactly $$$m$$$ pens and $$$k$$$ notebooks.Determine whether the Cossack can rewardallparticipants, giving each of them at least one pen and at least one notebook.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, m, k \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of participants, the number of pens, and the number of notebooks respectively.OutputPrint \"Yes\" if it possible to reward all the participants. Otherwise, print \"No\".You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).ExamplesInput5 8 6OutputYesInput3 9 3OutputYesInput8 5 20OutputNoNoteIn the first example, there are $$$5$$$ participants. The Cossack has $$$8$$$ pens and $$$6$$$ notebooks. Therefore, he has enough pens and notebooks.In the second example, there are $$$3$$$ participants. The Cossack has $$$9$$$ pens and $$$3$$$ notebooks. He has more than enough pens but only the minimum needed number of notebooks.In the third example, there are $$$8$$$ participants but only $$$5$$$ pens. Since the Cossack does not have enough pens, the answer is \"No\".",
