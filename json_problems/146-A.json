Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits4and7. For example, numbers47,744,4are lucky and5,17,467are not.Petya loves tickets very much. As we know, each ticket has a number that is a positive integer. Its length equalsn(nis always even). Petya calls a ticket lucky if the ticket's number is a lucky number and the sum of digits in the first half (the sum of the firstn/ 2digits) equals the sum of digits in the second half (the sum of the lastn/ 2digits). Check if the given ticket is lucky.InputThe first line contains an even integern(2 ≤n≤ 50)— the length of the ticket number that needs to be checked. The second line contains an integer whose length equals exactlyn— the ticket number. The number may contain leading zeros.OutputOn the first line print \"YES\" if the given ticket number is lucky. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).ExamplesInput247OutputNOInput44738OutputNOInput44774OutputYESNoteIn the first sample the sum of digits in the first half does not equal the sum of digits in the second half (4 ≠ 7).In the second sample the ticket number is not the lucky number.",
