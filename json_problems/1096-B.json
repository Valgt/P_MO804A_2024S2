Substring Removaltime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. So, string \"forces\" is substring of string \"codeforces\", but string \"coder\" is not.Your task is to calculate the number of ways to removeexactlyone substring from this string in such a way thatallremaining characters areequal(the number of distinct characters either zero or one).It is guaranteed that there isat least twodifferent characters in $$$s$$$.Note that youcanremove the whole string and it is correct. Also note that you shouldremove at least one character.Since the answer can be rather large (not very large though) print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.The second line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.It is guaranteed that there isat least twodifferent characters in $$$s$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the number of ways modulo $$$998244353$$$ to removeexactlyone substring from $$$s$$$ in such way thatallremaining characters areequal.ExamplesInput4 abaaOutput6Input7 aacdeeeOutput6Input2 azOutput3NoteLet $$$s[l; r]$$$ be the substring of $$$s$$$ from the position $$$l$$$ to the position $$$r$$$ inclusive.Then in the first example you can remove the following substrings:$$$s[1; 2]$$$;$$$s[1; 3]$$$;$$$s[1; 4]$$$;$$$s[2; 2]$$$;$$$s[2; 3]$$$;$$$s[2; 4]$$$.In the second example you can remove the following substrings:$$$s[1; 4]$$$;$$$s[1; 5]$$$;$$$s[1; 6]$$$;$$$s[1; 7]$$$;$$$s[2; 7]$$$;$$$s[3; 7]$$$.In the third example you can remove the following substrings:$$$s[1; 1]$$$;$$$s[1; 2]$$$;$$$s[2; 2]$$$.",
