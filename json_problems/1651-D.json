The coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point are $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$.For each point $$$i$$$, find the nearest (in terms of Manhattan distance) point withinteger coordinatesthat is not among the given $$$n$$$ points. If there are multiple such points — you can choose any of them.The Manhattan distance between two points $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ is $$$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of points in the set.The next $$$n$$$ lines describe points. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point.It is guaranteed that all points in the input are distinct.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ lines. In the $$$i$$$-th line, print the point withinteger coordinatesthat is not among the given $$$n$$$ points and is the nearest (in terms of Manhattan distance) to the $$$i$$$-th point from the input.Output coordinates should be in range $$$[-10^6; 10^6]$$$. It can be shown that any optimal answer meets these constraints.If there are several answers, you can print any of them.ExamplesInput6 2 2 1 2 2 1 3 2 2 3 5 5Output1 1 1 1 2 0 3 1 2 4 5 4Input8 4 4 2 4 2 2 2 3 1 4 4 2 1 3 3 3Output4 3 2 5 2 1 2 5 1 5 4 1 1 2 3 2",
