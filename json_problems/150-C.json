Smart Cheatertime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutI guess there's not much point in reminding you that Nvodsk winters aren't exactly hot. That increased the popularity of the public transport dramatically. The route of bus62has exactlynstops (stop1goes first on its way and stopngoes last). The stops are positioned on a straight line and their coordinates are0 =x1<x2< ... <xn.Each day exactlympeople use bus62. For each person we know the number of the stop where he gets on the bus and the number of the stop where he gets off the bus. A ticket from stopato stopb(a<b) costsxb-xarubles. However, the conductor can choose no more than one segment NOT TO SELL a ticket for. We mean that conductor should choose C and D (С <= D) and sell a ticket for the segments [A,C] and [D,B], or not sell the ticket at all. The conductor and the passenger divide the saved money between themselves equally. The conductor's \"untaxed income\" is sometimes interrupted by inspections that take place as the bus drives on some segment of the route located between two consecutive stops. The inspector fines the conductor bycrubles for each passenger who doesn't have the ticket for this route's segment.You know the coordinated of all stopsxi; the numbers of stops where thei-th passenger gets on and off,aiandbi(ai<bi); the finec; and alsopi— the probability of inspection on segment between thei-th and thei+ 1-th stop. The conductor asked you to help him make a plan of selling tickets that maximizes the mathematical expectation of his profit.InputThe first line contains three integersn,mandc(2 ≤n≤ 150 000,1 ≤m≤ 300 000,1 ≤c≤ 10 000).The next line containsnintegersxi(0 ≤xi≤ 109,x1= 0,xi<xi+ 1) — the coordinates of the stops on the bus's route.The third line containsn- 1integerpi(0 ≤pi≤ 100) — the probability of inspection in percents on the segment between stopiand stopi+ 1.Then followmlines that describe the bus's passengers. Each line contains exactly two integersaiandbi(1 ≤ai<bi≤n) — the numbers of stops where thei-th passenger gets on and off.OutputPrint the single real number — the maximum expectation of the conductor's profit. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed10- 6.Namely: let's assume that your answer isa, and the answer of the jury isb. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if.ExamplesInput3 3 100 10 100100 01 22 31 3Output90.000000000Input10 8 1870 10 30 70 150 310 630 1270 2550 5110013 87 65 0 100 44 67 3 41 102 93 81 56 102 74 104 5Output76859.990000000NoteA comment to the first sample:The first and third passengers get tickets from stop1to stop2. The second passenger doesn't get a ticket. There always is inspection on the segment1-2but both passengers have the ticket for it. There never is an inspection on the segment2-3, that's why the second passenger gets away with the cheating. Our total profit is(0 + 90 / 2 + 90 / 2) = 90.",
