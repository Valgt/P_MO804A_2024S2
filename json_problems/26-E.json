There areNprocesses and thei-th process has the following pseudocode:repeatnitimesyi:=yy:=yi+ 1end repeatHereyis a shared variable. Everything else is local for the process. All actions on a given row are atomic, i.e. when the process starts executing a row it is never interrupted. Beyond that all interleavings are possible, i.e. every process that has yet work to do can be granted the rights to execute its next row. In the beginningy= 0. You will be given an integerWandni, fori= 1, ... ,N. Determine if it is possible that after all processes terminate,y=W, and if it is possible output an arbitrary schedule that will produce this final value.InputIn the first line of the input you will be given two space separated integersN(1 ≤N≤ 100) andW(- 109≤W≤ 109). In the second line there areNspace separated integersni(1 ≤ni≤ 1000).OutputOn the first line of the output writeYesif it is possible that at the endy=W, orNootherwise. If the answer isNothen there is no second line, but if the answer isYes, then on the second line output a space separated list of integers representing some schedule that leads to the desired result.

The processes are numbered starting from 1. The list of integers represent which process works on its next instruction at a given step. For example, consider the schedule1 2 2 1 3. First process1executes its first instruction, then process2executes its first two instructions, after that process1executes its second instruction, and finally process3executes its first instruction.
