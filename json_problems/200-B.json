That's why any food and drink in his kitchen necessarily contains orange juice. There arendrinks in his fridge, the volume fraction of orange juice in thei-th drink equalspipercent.One day Vasya decided to make himself an orange cocktail. He took equal proportions of each of thendrinks and mixed them. Then he wondered, how much orange juice the cocktail has.Find the volume fraction of orange juice in the final drink.InputThe first input line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of orange-containing drinks in Vasya's fridge. The second line containsnintegerspi(0 ≤pi≤ 100) — the volume fraction of orange juice in thei-th drink, in percent. The numbers are separated by a space.OutputPrint the volume fraction in percent of orange juice in Vasya's cocktail. The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error does not exceed10- 4.ExamplesInput350 50 100Output66.666666666667Input40 25 50 75Output37.500000000000NoteNote to the first sample: let's assume that Vasya takesxmilliliters of each drink from the fridge. Then the volume of pure juice in the cocktail will equalmilliliters. The total cocktail's volume equals3·xmilliliters, so the volume fraction of the juice in the cocktail equals, that is,66.(6)percent.",
