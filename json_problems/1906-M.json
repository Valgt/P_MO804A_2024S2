Label one arbitrary side as side $$$1$$$, then label the next sides in clockwise order as side $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$\\\\dots$$$, $$$N$$$. There are $$$A_i$$$ special points on side $$$i$$$. These points are positioned such that side $$$i$$$ is divided into $$$A_i + 1$$$ segments with equal length.For instance, suppose that you have a regular $$$4$$$-sided polygon, i.e., a square. The following illustration shows how the special points are located within each side when $$$A = [3, 1, 4, 6]$$$. The uppermost side is labelled as side $$$1$$$.You want to create as manynon-degenerate trianglesas possible while satisfying the following requirements. Each triangle consists of $$$3$$$ distinct special points (not necessarily from different sides) as its corners. Each special point can only become the corner of at most $$$1$$$ triangle. All triangles must not intersect with each other.Determine the maximum number of non-degenerate triangles that you can create.A triangle isnon-degenerateif it has a positive area.InputThe first line consists of an integer $$$N$$$ ($$$3 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 200\\\\,000$$$).The following line consists of $$$N$$$ integers $$$A_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq A_i \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^9$$$).OutputOutput a single integer representing the maximum number of non-degenerate triangles that you can create.ExamplesInput4 3 1 4 6Output4Input6 1 2 1 2 1 2Output3Input3 1 1 1Output1NoteExplanation for the sample input/output #1One possible construction which achieves maximum number of non-degenerate triangles can be seen in the following illustration.Explanation for the sample input/output #2One possible construction which achieves maximum number of non-degenerate triangles can be seen in the following illustration.",
