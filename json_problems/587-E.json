She's a competitive programming fan. That's why, when he saw her minister, Malek, free, she gave her a sequence consisting ofnnon-negative integers,a1,a2, ...,anand asked him to performqqueries for her on this sequence.There are two types of queries:given numbersl,randk, Malek should performfor eachl≤i≤r(, bitwise exclusive OR of numbersaandb).given numberslandrMalek should tell her the score of sequenceal,al+ 1, ... ,ar.Score of a sequenceb1, ...,bkis the number of its different Kheshtaks. A non-negative integerwis a Kheshtak of this sequence if and only if there exists a subsequence ofb, let's denote it asbi1,bi2, ... ,bix(possibly empty) such that(1 ≤i1<i2< ... <ix≤k). If this subsequence is empty, thenw= 0.Unlike Duff, Malek is not a programmer. That's why he asked for your help. Please help him perform these queries.InputThe first line of input contains two integers,nandq(1 ≤n≤ 2 × 105and1 ≤q≤ 4 × 104).The second line of input containsnintegers,a1,a2, ...,anseparated by spaces (0 ≤ai≤ 109for each1 ≤i≤n).The nextqlines contain the queries. Each line starts with an integert(1 ≤t≤ 2), type of the corresponding query. Ift= 1, then there are three more integers in that line,l,randk. Otherwise there are two more integers,landr.
