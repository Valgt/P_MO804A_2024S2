The string consists of lowercase Latin letters. The Nut is a curious guy, so he wants to find the number of strictly increasing sequences $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$$$, such that:For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq k$$$), $$$s_{p_i} =$$$'a'.For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i < k$$$), there is such $$$j$$$ that $$$p_i < j < p_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$s_j =$$$'b'.The Nut is upset because he doesn't know how to find the number. Help him.This number should be calculated modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.InputThe first line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq |s| \\\\leq 10^5$$$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.OutputIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the number of such sequences $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$$$ modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExamplesInputabbaaOutput5InputbaaaaOutput4InputagaaOutput3NoteIn the first example, there are $$$5$$$ possible sequences. $$$[1]$$$, $$$[4]$$$, $$$[5]$$$, $$$[1, 4]$$$, $$$[1, 5]$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ possible sequences. $$$[2]$$$, $$$[3]$$$, $$$[4]$$$, $$$[5]$$$.In the third example, there are $$$3$$$ possible sequences. $$$[1]$$$, $$$[3]$$$, $$$[4]$$$.",
