    "statement": "D. Cartons of milktime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOlya likes milk very much. She drinkskcartons of milk each day if she has at leastkand drinks all of them if she doesn't. But there's an issue — expiration dates. Each carton has a date after which you can't drink it (you still can drink it exactly at the date written on the carton). Due to this, if Olya's fridge contains a carton past its expiry date, she throws it away.Olya hates throwing out cartons, so when she drinks a carton, she chooses the one which expires the fastest. It's easy to understand that this strategy minimizes the amount of cartons thrown out and lets her avoid it if it's even possible.Milk. Best before: 20.02.2017.The main issue Olya has is the one of buying new cartons. Currently, there arencartons of milk in Olya's fridge, for each one an expiration date is known (how soon does it expire, measured in days). In the shop that Olya visited there aremcartons, and the expiration date is known for each of those cartons as well.Find the maximum number of cartons Olya can buy so that she wouldn't have to throw away any cartons. Assume that Olya drank no cartons today.InputIn the first line there are three integersn,m,k(1 ≤n,m≤ 106,1 ≤k≤n+m) — the amount of cartons in Olya's fridge, the amount of cartons in the shop and the number of cartons Olya drinks each day.In the second line there arenintegersf1,f2, ...,fn(0 ≤fi≤ 107) — expiration dates of the cartons in Olya's fridge. The expiration date is expressed by the number of days the drinking of this carton can be delayed. For example, a0expiration date means it must be drunk today,1— no later than tomorrow, etc.In the third line there aremintegerss1,s2, ...,sm(0 ≤si≤ 107) — expiration dates of the cartons in the shop in a similar format.OutputIf there's no way for Olya to drink the cartons she already has in her fridge, print-1.Otherwise, in the first line print the maximum numberxof cartons which Olya can buy so that she wouldn't have to throw a carton away. The next line should contain exactlyxintegers — the numbers of the cartons that should be bought (cartons are numbered in an order in which they are written in the input, starting with1). Numbers should not repeat, but can be in arbitrary order. If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput3 6 21 0 12 0 2 0 0 2Output31 2 3Input3 1 20 0 01Output-1Input2 1 20 10Output11NoteIn the first examplek= 2and Olya has three cartons with expiry dates0,1and1(they expire today, tomorrow and tomorrow), and the shop has3cartons with expiry date0and3cartons with expiry date2.
