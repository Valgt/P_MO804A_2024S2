Sereja and Mirroringtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLet's assume that we are given a matrixbof sizex×y, let's determine the operation of mirroring matrixb. The mirroring of matrixbis a2x×ymatrixcwhich has the following properties:the upper half of matrixc(rows with numbers from1tox) exactly matchesb;the lower half of matrixc(rows with numbers fromx+ 1to2x) is symmetric to the upper one; the symmetry line is the line that separates two halves (the line that goes in the middle, between rowsxandx+ 1).Sereja has ann×mmatrixa. He wants to find such matrixb, that it can be transformed into matrixa, if we'll perform on itseveral(possibly zero) mirrorings. What minimum number of rows can such matrix contain?InputThe first line contains two integers,nandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 100). Each of the nextnlines containsmintegers — the elements of matrixa. Thei-th line contains integersai1,ai2, ...,aim(0 ≤aij≤ 1)— thei-th row of the matrixa.OutputIn the single line, print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of rows of matrixb.ExamplesInput4 30 0 11 1 01 1 00 0 1Output2Input3 30 0 00 0 00 0 0Output3Input8 101100110Output2NoteIn the first test sample the answer is a2 × 3matrixb:001110If we perform a mirroring operation with this matrix, we get the matrixathat is given in the input:001110110001",
