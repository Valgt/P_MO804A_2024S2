It turns out that – contrary to previous beliefs – every zombie isbornwith a single brain, and only later it evolves into a complicated brain structure. In fact, whenever a zombie consumes a brain, a new brain appears in its nervous system and gets immediately connected to one of the already existing brains using a single brain connector. Researchers are now interested in monitoring the brain latency of a zombie. Your task is to write a program which, given a history of evolution of a zombie's nervous system, computes its brain latency at every stage.InputThe first line of the input contains one numbern– the number of brains in the final nervous system (2 ≤n≤ 200000). In the second line a history of zombie's nervous system evolution is given. For convenience, we number all the brains by1, 2, ...,nin the same order as they appear in the nervous system (the zombie is born with a single brain, number1, and subsequently brains2, 3, ...,nare added). The second line containsn- 1space-separated numbersp2,p3, ...,pn, meaning that after a new brainkis added to the system, it gets connected to a parent-brain.OutputOutputn- 1space-separated numbers – the brain latencies after the brain numberkis added, fork= 2, 3, ...,n.ExampleInput612215Output1 2 2 3 4",
