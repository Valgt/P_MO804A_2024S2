Malek Dance Clubtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutAs a tradition, every year before IOI all the members of Natalia Fan Club are invited to Malek Dance Club to have a fun night together. Malek Dance Club has2nmembers and coincidentally Natalia Fan Club also has2nmembers. Each member of MDC is assigned a unique idifrom0to2n- 1. The same holds for each member of NFC.One of the parts of this tradition is one by one dance, where each member of MDC dances with a member of NFC. A dance pair is a pair of numbers(a,b)such that memberafrom MDC dances with memberbfrom NFC.The complexity of a pairs' assignment is the number of pairs of dancing pairs(a,b)and(c,d)such thata<candb>d.You are given a binary number of lengthnnamedx. We know that memberifrom MDC dances with memberfrom NFC. Your task is to calculate the complexity of this assignment modulo1000000007(109+ 7).Expressiondenotes applying «XOR» to numbersxandy. This operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, inC++andJavait denotes as «^», inPascal— «xor».InputThe first line of input contains a binary numberxof lenghtn,(1 ≤n≤ 100).This number may contain leading zeros.OutputPrint the complexity of the given dance assignent modulo1000000007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput11Output6Input01Output2Input1Output1",
