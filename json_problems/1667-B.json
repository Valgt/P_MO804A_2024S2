Optimal Partitiontime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. You should divide $$$a$$$ into continuous non-empty subarrays (there are $$$2^{n-1}$$$ ways to do that).Let $$$s=a_l+a_{l+1}+\\\\ldots+a_r$$$. The value of a subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\\\ldots, a_r$$$ is:$$$(r-l+1)$$$ if $$$s>0$$$,$$$0$$$ if $$$s=0$$$,$$$-(r-l+1)$$$ if $$$s<0$$$.What is the maximum sum of values you can get with a partition?InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the maximum sum of values you can get with an optimal parition.ExampleInput531 2 -340 -2 3 -45-1 -2 3 -1 -16-1 2 -3 4 -5 671 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1Output1 2 1 6 -1NoteTest case $$$1$$$: one optimal partition is $$$[1, 2]$$$, $$$[-3]$$$. $$$1+2>0$$$ so the value of $$$[1, 2]$$$ is $$$2$$$. $$$-3<0$$$, so the value of $$$[-3]$$$ is $$$-1$$$. $$$2+(-1)=1$$$.Test case $$$2$$$: the optimal partition is $$$[0, -2, 3]$$$, $$$[-4]$$$, and the sum of values is $$$3+(-1)=2$$$.",
