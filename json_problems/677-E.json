Vanya and Balloonstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVanya plays a game of balloons on the field of sizen×n, where each cell contains a balloon with one of the values0,1,2or3. The goal is to destroy a cross, such that the product of all values of balloons in the cross is maximum possible. There are two types of crosses: normal and rotated. For example:**o****o**ooooo**o****o**oro***o*o*o***o***o*o*o***oFormally, the cross is given by three integersr,candd, such thatd≤r,c≤n-d+ 1. The normal cross consists of balloons located in cells(x,y)(wherexstay for the number of the row andyfor the number of the column), such that|x-r|·|y-c| = 0and|x-r| + |y-c| <d. Rotated cross consists of balloons located in cells(x,y), such that|x-r| = |y-c|and|x-r| <d.Vanya wants to know the maximum possible product of the values of balls forming one cross. As this value can be large, output it modulo109+ 7.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns in the table with balloons.The each of the followingnlines containsncharacters '0', '1', '2' or '3' — the description of the values in balloons.OutputPrint the maximum possible product modulo109+ 7. Note, that you are not asked to maximize the remainder modulo109+ 7, but to find the maximum value and print it this modulo.ExamplesInput41233021320200303Output108Input50030000300333330030000300Output19683Input50000302030003000302030000Output108Input52131210003100021000323231Output3Input51213112111121122131121212Output24NoteIn the first sample, the maximum product is achieved for a rotated cross with a center in the cell(3, 3)and radius1:2·2·3·3·3 = 108.",
