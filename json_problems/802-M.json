April Fools' Problem (easy)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe marmots have prepared a very easy problem for this year's HC2– this one. It involves numbersn,kand a sequence ofnpositive integersa1,a2, ...,an. They also came up with a beautiful and riveting story for the problem statement. It explains what the input means, what the program should output, and it also reads like a good criminal.However I, Heidi, will have none of that. As my joke for today, I am removing the story from the statement and replacing it with these two unhelpful paragraphs. Now solve the problem, fools!InputThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integersnandk(1 ≤k≤n≤ 2200). The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 104).OutputOutput one number.ExamplesInput8 51 1 1 1 1 1 1 1Output5Input10 316 8 2 4 512 256 32 128 64 1Output7Input5 120 10 50 30 46Output10Input6 66 6 6 6 6 6Output36Input1 1100Output100",
