You Are Given Some Strings...time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$ strings $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\dots, s_n$$$. All strings consist of lowercase Latin letters.Let $$$f(t, s)$$$ be the number of occurences of string $$$s$$$ in string $$$t$$$. For example, $$$f('\\\\text{aaabacaa}', '\\\\text{aa}') = 3$$$, and $$$f('\\\\text{ababa}', '\\\\text{aba}') = 2$$$.Calculate the value of $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\\\sum\\\\limits_{j=1}^{n} f(t, s_i + s_j)$$$, where $$$s + t$$$ is the concatenation of strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$. Note that if there are two pairs $$$i_1$$$, $$$j_1$$$ and $$$i_2$$$, $$$j_2$$$ such that $$$s_{i_1} + s_{j_1} = s_{i_2} + s_{j_2}$$$, you should include both $$$f(t, s_{i_1} + s_{j_1})$$$ and $$$f(t, s_{i_2} + s_{j_2})$$$ in answer.InputThe first line contains string $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |t| \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).Each of next $$$n$$$ lines contains string $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s_i| \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).It is guaranteed that $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n} |s_i| \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$. All strings consist of lowercase English letters.OutputPrint one integer â€” the value of $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\\\sum\\\\limits_{j=1}^{n} f(t, s_i + s_j)$$$.ExamplesInputaaabacaa 2 a aaOutput5Inputaaabacaa 4 a a a bOutput33",
