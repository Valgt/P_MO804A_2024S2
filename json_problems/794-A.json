    "statement": "A. Bank Robberytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA robber has attempted to rob a bank but failed to complete his task. However, he had managed to open all the safes.Oleg the bank client loves money (who doesn't), and decides to take advantage of this failed robbery and steal some money from the safes. There are many safes arranged in a line, where thei-th safe from the left is called safei. There arenbanknotes left in all the safes in total. Thei-th banknote is in safexi. Oleg is now at safea. There are two security guards, one of which guards the safebsuch thatb<a, i.e. the first guard is to the left of Oleg. The other guard guards the safecso thatc>a, i.e. he is to the right of Oleg.The two guards are very lazy, so they do not move. In every second, Oleg can either take all the banknotes from the current safe or move to any of the neighboring safes. However, he cannot visit any safe that is guarded by security guards at any time, becaues he might be charged for stealing. Determine the maximum amount of banknotes Oleg can gather.InputThe first line of input contains three space-separated integers,a,bandc(1 ≤b<a<c≤ 109), denoting the positions of Oleg, the first security guard and the second security guard, respectively.The next line of input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 105), denoting the number of banknotes.The next line of input containsnspace-separated integersx1,x2, ...,xn(1 ≤xi≤ 109), denoting that thei-th banknote is located in thexi-th safe. Note thatxiarenotguaranteed to be distinct.OutputOutput a single integer: the maximum number of banknotes Oleg can take.ExamplesInput5 3 784 7 5 5 3 6 2 8Output4Input6 5 751 5 7 92 3Output0NoteIn the first example Oleg can take the banknotes in positions4,5,6(note that there are2banknotes at position5). Oleg can't take the banknotes in safes7and8because he can't run into the second security guard. Similarly, Oleg cannot take the banknotes at positions3and2because he can't run into the first security guard. Thus, he can take a maximum of4banknotes.For the second sample, Oleg can't take any banknotes without bumping into any of the security guards.",
