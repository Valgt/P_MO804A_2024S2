Let's define transformationfof this permutation:wherek(k> 1)is an integer, the transformation parameter,ris such maximum integer thatrk≤n. Ifrk=n, then elementsprk+ 1,prk+ 2and so on are omitted. In other words, the described transformation of permutationpcyclically shifts to the left each consecutive block of lengthkand the last block with the length equal to the remainder after dividingnbyk.John Doe thinks that permutationf(f( ...f(p= [1, 2, ...,n], 2) ... ,n- 1),n)is beautiful. Unfortunately, he cannot quickly find the beautiful permutation he's interested in. That's why he asked you to help him.Your task is to find a beautiful permutation for the givenn.
