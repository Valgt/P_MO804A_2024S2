    "statement": "C1. Alternating bits oracletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputImplement a quantum oracle on $$$N$$$ qubits which checks whether the bits in the input vector $$$\\\\vec{x}$$$ alternate (i.e., implements the function $$$f(\\\\vec{x}) = 1$$$ if $$$\\\\vec{x}$$$ does not have a pair of adjacent bits in state 00 or 11).You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:an array of $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le N \\\\le 7$$$) qubits $$$x$$$ in an arbitrary state (input register),a qubit $$$y$$$ in an arbitrary state (output qubit),and performs a transformation $$$|x\\\\rangle|y\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow |x\\\\rangle|y \\\\oplus f(x)\\\\rangle$$$. The operation doesn't have an output; its \"output\" is the state in which it leaves the qubits. Note that the input register $$$x$$$ has to remain unchanged after applying the operation.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit) : Unit {body (...) {// your code here}adjoint auto;}}Note: the operation has to have an adjoint specified for it;adjoint automeans that the adjoint will be generated automatically. For details on adjoint, seeOperation Definitions.You are not allowed to use measurements in your operation.",
