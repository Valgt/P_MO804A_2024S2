The vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and the root is the vertex $$$1$$$. You are also given a score array $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_n$$$.A multiset of $$$k$$$ simple paths is called valid if the following two conditions are both true.Each path starts from $$$1$$$.Let $$$c_i$$$ be the number of paths covering vertex $$$i$$$. For each pair of vertices $$$(u,v)$$$ ($$$2\\\\le u,v\\\\le n$$$) that have the same parent, $$$|c_u-c_v|\\\\le 1$$$ holds.Thevalueof the path multiset is defined as $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^n c_i s_i$$$.It can be shown that it is always possible to find at least one valid multiset. Find the maximumvalueamong all valid multisets.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the size of the tree and the required number of paths.The second line contains $$$n - 1$$$ space-separated integers $$$p_2,p_3,\\\\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le p_i\\\\le n$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is the parent of the $$$i$$$-th vertex. It is guaranteed that this value describe a valid tree with root $$$1$$$.The third line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$s_1,s_2,\\\\ldots,s_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le s_i \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the scores of the vertices.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the maximumvalueof a path multiset.ExampleInput25 41 2 1 36 2 1 5 75 31 2 1 36 6 1 4 10Output54 56NoteIn the first test case, one of optimal solutions is four paths $$$1 \\\\to 2 \\\\to 3 \\\\to 5$$$, $$$1 \\\\to 2 \\\\to 3 \\\\to 5$$$, $$$1 \\\\to 4$$$, $$$1 \\\\to 4$$$, here $$$c=[4,2,2,2,2]$$$.
