Players are given an integer $$$n$$$. On their turn, the player can add $$$1$$$ to the current integer or subtract $$$1$$$. The players take turns; Vanya starts. IfafterVanya's move the integer is divisible by $$$3$$$, then he wins. If $$$10$$$ moves have passed and Vanya has not won, then Vova wins.Write a program that, based on the integer $$$n$$$, determines who will win if both players play optimally.InputThe first line contains the integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The single line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1000$$$).OutputFor each test case, print \"First\" without quotes if Vanya wins, and \"Second\" without quotes if Vova wins.ExampleInput61351009991000OutputFirst Second First First Second First",
