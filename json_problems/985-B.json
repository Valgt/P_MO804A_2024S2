Thei-th switch turns on some subset of the lamps. This information is given as the matrixaconsisting ofnrows andmcolumns whereai,j= 1if thei-th switch turns on thej-th lamp andai,j= 0if thei-th switch is not connected to thej-th lamp.Initially allmlamps are turned off.Switches change state only from \"off\" to \"on\". It means that if you press two or more switches connected to the same lamp then the lamp will be turned on after any of this switches is pressed and will remain its state even if any switch connected to this lamp is pressed afterwards.It is guaranteed that if you push allnswitches thenallmlamps will be turned on.Your think that you have too many switches and you would like to ignore one of them.Your task is to say if there exists such a switch that if you will ignore (not use) it but press all the othern- 1switches then all themlamps will be turned on.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 2000) — the number of the switches and the number of the lamps.The followingnlines containmcharacters each. The characterai,jis equal to '1' if thei-th switch turns on thej-th lamp and '0' otherwise.It is guaranteed that if you press allnswitchesallmlamps will be turned on.OutputPrint \"YES\" if there is a switch that if you will ignore it and press all the othern- 1switches then allmlamps will be turned on.
