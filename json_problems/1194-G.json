Another Meme Problemtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call a fraction $$$\\\\frac{x}{y}$$$ good if there exists at least one another fraction $$$\\\\frac{x'}{y'}$$$ such that $$$\\\\frac{x}{y} = \\\\frac{x'}{y'}$$$, $$$1 \\\\le x', y' \\\\le 9$$$, the digit denoting $$$x'$$$ is contained in the decimal representation of $$$x$$$, and the digit denoting $$$y'$$$ is contained in the decimal representation of $$$y$$$. For example, $$$\\\\frac{26}{13}$$$ is a good fraction, because $$$\\\\frac{26}{13} = \\\\frac{2}{1}$$$.You are given an integer number $$$n$$$. Please calculate the number of good fractions $$$\\\\frac{x}{y}$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le n$$$ and $$$1 \\\\le y \\\\le n$$$. The answer may be really large, so print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe only line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n < 10^{100}$$$).OutputPrint the number of good fractions $$$\\\\frac{x}{y}$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le n$$$ and $$$1 \\\\le y \\\\le n$$$.
