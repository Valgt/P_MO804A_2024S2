Anton and Schooltime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAnton goes to school, his favorite lessons are arraystudying. He usually solves all the tasks pretty fast, but this time the teacher gave him a complicated one: given two arraysbandcof lengthn, find arraya, such that:whereaandbmeans bitwise AND, whileaorbmeans bitwise OR.Usually Anton is good in arraystudying, but this problem is too hard, so Anton asks you to help.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integersn(1 ≤n≤ 200 000) — the size of arraysbandc.The second line containsnintegersbi(0 ≤bi≤ 109) — elements of the arrayb.Third line containsnintegersci(0 ≤ci≤ 109) — elements of the arrayc.OutputIf there is no solution, print- 1.Otherwise, the only line of the output should containnnon-negative integersai— elements of the arraya. If there are multiple possible solutions, you may print any of them.ExamplesInput46 8 4 416 22 10 10Output3 5 1 1Input58 25 14 7 1619 6 9 4 25Output-1",
