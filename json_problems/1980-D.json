GCD-sequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGCD(Greatest Common Divisor) of two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ is the maximum integer $$$z$$$ by which both $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are divisible. For example, $$$GCD(36, 48) = 12$$$, $$$GCD(5, 10) = 5$$$, and $$$GCD(7,11) = 1$$$.Kristina has an array $$$a$$$ consisting of exactly $$$n$$$ positive integers. She wants to count the GCD of each neighbouring pair of numbers to get a new array $$$b$$$, calledGCD-sequence.So, the elements of the GCD-sequence $$$b$$$ will be calculated using the formula $$$b_i = GCD(a_i, a_{i + 1})$$$ for $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n - 1$$$.Determine whether it is possible to removeexactly onenumber from the array $$$a$$$ so that the GCD sequence $$$b$$$ is non-decreasing (i.e., $$$b_i \\\\le b_{i+1}$$$ is always true).For example, let Khristina had an array $$$a$$$ = [$$$20, 6, 12, 3, 48, 36$$$]. If she removes $$$a_4 = 3$$$ from it and counts the GCD-sequence of $$$b$$$, she gets:$$$b_1 = GCD(20, 6) = 2$$$$$$b_2 = GCD(6, 12) = 6$$$$$$b_3 = GCD(12, 48) = 12$$$$$$b_4 = GCD(48, 36) = 12$$$The resulting GCD sequence $$$b$$$ = [$$$2,6,12,12$$$] is non-decreasing because $$$b_1 \\\\le b_2 \\\\le b_3 \\\\le b_4$$$.InputThe first line of input data contains a single number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — he number of test cases in the test.This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test case does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single line:\"YES\" if you can removeexactly onenumber from the array $$$a$$$ so that the GCD-sequence of $$$b$$$ is non-decreasing;\"NO\" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will all be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput12620 6 12 3 48 36412 6 3 4310 12 3532 16 8 4 25100 50 2 10 2042 4 8 1107 4 6 2 4 5 1 4 2 875 9 6 8 5 9 2611 14 8 12 9 395 7 3 10 6 3 12 6 334 2 481 6 11 12 6 12 3 6OutputYES NO YES NO YES YES NO YES YES YES YES YESNoteThe first test case is explained in the problem statement.",
