A Heap of Heapstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAndrew skipped lessons on the subject 'Algorithms and Data Structures' for the entire term. When he came to the final test, the teacher decided to give him a difficult task as a punishment.The teacher gave Andrew an array ofnnumbersa1,...,an. After that he asked Andrew for eachkfrom 1 ton- 1to build ak-ary heap on the array and count the number of elements for which the property of the minimum-rooted heap is violated, i.e. the value of an element is less than the value of its parent.Andrew looked up on the Wikipedia that ak-ary heap is a rooted tree with vertices in elements of the array. If the elements of the array are indexed from 1 ton, then the children of elementvare elements with indicesk(v- 1) + 2,...,kv+ 1(if some of these elements lie outside the borders of the array, the corresponding children are absent). In anyk-ary heap every element except for the first one has exactly one parent; for the element 1 the parent is absent (this element is therootof the heap). Denotep(v)as the number of the parent of the element with the numberv. Let's say that for a non-root elementvtheproperty of the heap is violatedifav<ap(v).Help Andrew cope with the task!InputThe first line contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 2·105).The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1,...,an(- 109≤ai≤ 109).Outputin a single line printn- 1integers, separate the consecutive numbers with a single space — the number of elements for which the property of thek-ary heap is violated, fork= 1,2,...,n- 1.ExamplesInput51 5 4 3 2Output3 2 1 0Input62 2 2 2 2 2Output0 0 0 0 0NotePictures with the heaps for the first sample are given below; elements for which the property of the heap is violated are marked with red.In the second sample all elements are equal, so the property holds for all pairs.",
