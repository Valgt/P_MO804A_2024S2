    "statement": "C. Pashmak and Busestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutRecently Pashmak has been employed in a transportation company. The company haskbuses and has a contract with a school which hasnstudents. The school planned to take the students toddifferent places forddays (each day in one place). Each day the company provides all the buses for the trip. Pashmak has to arrange the students in the buses. He wants to arrange the students in a way that no two students become close friends. In his ridiculous idea, two students will become close friends if and only if they are in the same buses for allddays.Please help Pashmak with his weird idea. Assume that each bus has an unlimited capacity.InputThe first line of input contains three space-separated integersn,k,d(1 ≤n,d≤ 1000; 1 ≤k≤ 109).OutputIf there is no valid arrangement just print-1. Otherwise printdlines, in each of them printnintegers. Thej-th integer of thei-th line shows which bus thej-th student has to take on thei-th day. You can assume that the buses are numbered from1tok.ExamplesInput3 2 2Output1 1 21 2 1Input3 2 1Output-1NoteNote that two students become close friends only if they share a bus each day. But the bus they share can differ from day to day.",
