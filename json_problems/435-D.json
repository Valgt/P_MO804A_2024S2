Moreover, it's not an ordinary grid — each unit square of the grid has painted diagonals.The figure below is an example of such grid of size3 × 5. Four nodes of this grid are black, the other11nodes are white.Your task is to count the number of such triangles on the given grid that:the corners match the white nodes, and the area is positive;all sides go along the grid lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal);no side contains black nodes.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(2 ≤n,m≤ 400). Each of the followingnlines containmcharacters (zeros and ones) — the description of the grid. If thej-th character in thei-th line equals zero, then the node on thei-th horizontal line and on thej-th vertical line is painted white. Otherwise, the node is painted black.The horizontal lines are numbered starting from one from top to bottom, the vertical lines are numbered starting from one from left to right.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of required triangles.ExamplesInput3 5100001001000001Output20Input2 20000Output4Input2 21111Output0NoteThe figure below shows red and blue triangles. They are the examples of the required triangles in the first sample. One of the invalid triangles is painted green. It is invalid because not all sides go along the grid lines.",
