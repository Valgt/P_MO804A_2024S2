    "statement": "B. Significant Cupstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputStepan is a very experienced olympiad participant. He hasncups for Physics olympiads andmcups for Informatics olympiads. Each cup is characterized by two parameters — its significanceciand widthwi.Stepan decided to expose some of his cups on a shelf with widthdin such a way, that:there is at least one Physics cup and at least one Informatics cup on the shelf,the total width of the exposed cups does not exceedd,from each subjects (Physics and Informatics) some of the most significant cups are exposed (i. e. if a cup for some subject with significancexis exposed, then all the cups for this subject with significance greater thanxmust be exposed too).Your task is to determine the maximum possible total significance, which Stepan can get when he exposes cups on the shelf with widthd, considering all the rules described above. The total significance is the sum of significances of all the exposed cups.InputThe first line contains three integersn,mandd(1 ≤n,m≤ 100 000,1 ≤d≤ 109) — the number of cups for Physics olympiads, the number of cups for Informatics olympiads and the width of the shelf.Each of the followingnlines contains two integersciandwi(1 ≤ci,wi≤ 109) — significance and width of thei-th cup for Physics olympiads.Each of the followingmlines contains two integerscjandwj(1 ≤cj,wj≤ 109) — significance and width of thej-th cup for Informatics olympiads.OutputPrint the maximum possible total significance, which Stepan can get exposing cups on the shelf with widthd, considering all the rules described in the statement.If there is no way to expose cups on the shelf, then print0.ExamplesInput3 1 84 25 54 23 2Output8Input4 3 123 42 43 53 43 55 23 4Output11Input2 2 25 36 34 28 1Output0NoteIn the first example Stepan has only one Informatics cup which must be exposed on the shelf. Its significance equals3and width equals2, so after Stepan exposes it, the width of free space on the shelf becomes equal to6. Also, Stepan must expose the second Physics cup (which has width5), because it is the most significant cup for Physics (its significance equals5). After that Stepan can not expose more cups on the shelf, because there is no enough free space. Thus, the maximum total significance of exposed cups equals to8.",
