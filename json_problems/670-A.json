Holidaystime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOn the planet Mars a year lasts exactlyndays (there are no leap years on Mars). But Martians have the same weeks as earthlings — 5 work days and then 2 days off. Your task is to determine the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of days off per year on Mars.InputThe first line of the input contains a positive integern(1 ≤n≤ 1 000 000) — the number of days in a year on Mars.OutputPrint two integers — the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of days off per year on Mars.ExamplesInput14Output4 4Input2Output0 2NoteIn the first sample there are14days in a year on Mars, and therefore independently of the day a year starts with there will be exactly4days off .In the second sample there are only2days in a year on Mars, and they can both be either work days or days off.",
