New Year and Old Propertytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe year 2015 is almost over.Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system —201510= 111110111112. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.InputThe only line of the input contains two integersaandb(1 ≤a≤b≤ 1018) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.OutputPrint one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.ExamplesInput5 10Output2Input2015 2015Output1Input100 105Output0Input72057594000000000 72057595000000000Output26NoteIn the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers510= 1012,610= 1102,710= 1112,810= 10002,910= 10012and1010= 10102.
