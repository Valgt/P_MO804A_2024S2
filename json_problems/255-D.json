    "statement": "D. Mr. Bender and Squaretime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutMr. Bender has a digital table of sizen×n, each cell can be switched on or off. He wants the field to have at leastcswitched on squares. When this condition is fulfilled, Mr Bender will be happy.We'll consider the table rows numbered from top to bottom from 1 ton, and the columns — numbered from left to right from 1 ton. Initially there is exactly one switched on cell with coordinates(x,y)(xis the row number,yis the column number), and all other cells are switched off. Then each second we switch on the cells that are off but have the side-adjacent cells that are on.For a cell with coordinates(x,y)the side-adjacent cells are cells with coordinates(x- 1,y),(x+ 1,y),(x,y- 1),(x,y+ 1).In how many seconds will Mr. Bender get happy?InputThe first line contains four space-separated integersn,x,y,c(1 ≤n,c≤ 109; 1 ≤x,y≤n;c≤n2).OutputIn a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput6 4 3 1Output0Input9 3 8 10Output2NoteInitially the first test has one painted cell, so the answer is 0. In the second test all events will go as is shown on the figure..",
