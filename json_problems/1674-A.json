You want to choose twostrictly positive(greater than zero) integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and then apply the following operation to $$$x$$$exactly$$$a$$$ times: replace $$$x$$$ with $$$b \\\\cdot x$$$.You want to find two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that $$$x$$$ becomes equal to $$$y$$$ after this process. If there are multiple possible pairs, you can chooseany of them. If there is no such pair, report it.For example:if $$$x = 3$$$ and $$$y = 75$$$, you may choose $$$a = 2$$$ and $$$b = 5$$$, so that $$$x$$$ becomes equal to $$$3 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 5 = 75$$$;if $$$x = 100$$$ and $$$y = 100$$$, you may choose $$$a = 3$$$ and $$$b = 1$$$, so that $$$x$$$ becomes equal to $$$100 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\cdot 1 = 100$$$;if $$$x = 42$$$ and $$$y = 13$$$, there is no answer since you cannot decrease $$$x$$$ with the given operations.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x, y \\\\le 100$$$).OutputIf it is possible to choose a pair of positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ so that $$$x$$$ becomes $$$y$$$ after the aforementioned process, print these two integers.The integers you print should be not less than $$$1$$$ and not greater than $$$10^9$$$(it can be shown that if the answer exists, there is a pair of integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ meeting these constraints). If there are multiple such pairs, print any of them.If it is impossible to choose a pair of integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ so that $$$x$$$ becomes $$$y$$$, print the integer $$$0$$$ twice.ExampleInput33 75100 10042 13Output2 5 3 1 0 0",
