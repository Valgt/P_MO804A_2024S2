The cost of a subsegment is the number of unordered pairs of distinct indices within the subsegment that contain equal elements. Split the given array intoknon-intersecting non-empty subsegments so that the sum of their costs is minimum possible. Each element should be present in exactly one subsegment.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(2 ≤n≤ 105,2 ≤k≤min(n, 20))— the length of the array and the number of segments you need to split the array into.The next line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤n) — the elements of the array.OutputPrint single integer: the minimum possible total cost of resulting subsegments.ExamplesInput7 31 1 3 3 3 2 1Output1Input10 21 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2Output8Input13 31 2 2 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1Output9NoteIn the first example it's optimal to split the sequence into the following three subsegments:[1],[1, 3],[3, 3, 2, 1]. The costs are0,0and1, thus the answer is1.In the second example it's optimal to split the sequence in two equal halves. The cost for each half is4.In the third example it's optimal to split the sequence in the following way:[1, 2, 2, 2, 1],[2, 1, 1, 1, 2],[2, 1, 1]. The costs are4,4,1.",
