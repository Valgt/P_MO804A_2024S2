Fake News (medium)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThanks to your help, Heidi is confident that no one can fool her. She has now decided to post some fake news on the HC2Facebook page. However, she wants to be able to communicate to the HC2committee that the post is fake, using some secret phrase hidden in the post as a subsequence. To make this method foolproof, she wants the phrase to appearntimes in the post. She is asking you to design a post (string)sand a hidden phrasepsuch thatpappears insas a subsequence exactlyntimes.InputThe first and only line of input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 1 000 000).OutputThe output should contain two nonempty stringssandpseparated by a single space. Each string should be composed of letters (a-zandA-Z: both lowercase and uppercase are allowed) and have length at most200. The number of occurrences ofpinsas a subsequence should be exactlyn. If there are many possible solutions, output any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.ExamplesInput2OutputhHheidi HeiInput4Outputbbbba baInput6Outputaaabb abNoteAn occurrence ofpas a subsequence insshould be thought of as a set of positions inssuch that the letters at these positions, in order, formp. The number of occurences is thus the number of such sets.
