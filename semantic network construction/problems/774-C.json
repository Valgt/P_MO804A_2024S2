Maximum Numbertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputStepan has the newest electronic device with a display. Different digits can be shown on it. Each digit is shown on a seven-section indicator like it is shown on the picture below.So, for example, to show the digit3on the display,5sections must be highlighted; and for the digit6,6sections must be highlighted.The battery of the newest device allows to highlight at mostnsections on the display.Stepan wants to know the maximum possible integer number which can be shown on the display of his newest device. Your task is to determine this number. Note that this number must not contain leading zeros. Assume that the size of the display is enough to show any integer.InputThe first line contains the integern(2 ≤n≤ 100 000) — the maximum number of sections which can be highlighted on the display.OutputPrint the maximum integer which can be shown on the display of Stepan's newest device.ExamplesInput2Output1Input3Output7", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "757560bf", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a maximum number of $n$ sections that can be highlighted, find the largest integer that can be displayed on a seven-segment display with those sections.
