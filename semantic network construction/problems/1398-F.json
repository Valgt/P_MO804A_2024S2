Controversial Roundstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob play a game. The game consists of several sets, and each set consists of several rounds. Each round is won either by Alice or by Bob, and the set ends when one of the players has won $$$x$$$ rounds in a row. For example, if Bob won five rounds in a row and $$$x = 2$$$, then two sets ends.You know that Alice and Bob have already played $$$n$$$ rounds, and you know the results of some rounds. For each $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, calculate the maximum possible number of sets that could have already finished if each set lasts until one of the players wins $$$x$$$ rounds in a row. It is possible that the last set is still not finished — in that case, you should not count it in the answer.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the number of rounds.The second line contains one string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ — the descriptions of rounds. If the $$$i$$$-th element of the string is0, then Alice won the $$$i$$$-th round; if it is1, then Bob won the $$$i$$$-th round, and if it is?, then you don't know who won the $$$i$$$-th round.OutputIn the only line print $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer should be equal to the maximum possible number of sets that could have already finished if each set lasts until one of the players wins $$$i$$$ rounds in a row.ExamplesInput6 11?000Output6 3 2 1 0 0Input5 01?01Output5 1 0 0 0Input12 ???1??????1?Output12 6 4 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1NoteLet's consider the first test case:if $$$x = 1$$$ and $$$s = 110000$$$ or $$$s = 111000$$$ then there are six finished sets;if $$$x = 2$$$ and $$$s = 110000$$$ then there are three finished sets;if $$$x = 3$$$ and $$$s = 111000$$$ then there are two finished sets;if $$$x = 4$$$ and $$$s = 110000$$$ then there is one finished set;if $$$x = 5$$$ then there are no finished sets;if $$$x = 6$$$ then there are no finished sets.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c6058ca3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ rounds, where each round can be won by either player (represented by 0 or 1) or be unknown (represented by ?).  \n\nFor each integer $x$ from 1 to $n$, determine the maximum number of sets that could have already finished, where each set ends when one player wins $x$ rounds in a row. \n\nOutput $n$ integers, where the $i$-th integer is the maximum number of sets that could have finished if each set lasts until one player wins $i$ rounds in a row."}, {"prompt_md5": "292f4b62", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a sequence of wins (0 for win by player A, 1 for win by player B, ? for unknown), find the maximum number of sets that could have finished for each possible number of consecutive wins required to end a set (1 to the length of the sequence).
