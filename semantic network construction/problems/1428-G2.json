Lucky Numbers (Hard Version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is in the constraint on $$$q$$$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.Zookeeper has been teaching his $$$q$$$ sheep how to write and how to add. The $$$i$$$-th sheep has to write exactly $$$k$$$non-negative integerswith the sum $$$n_i$$$.Strangely, sheep have superstitions about digits and believe that the digits $$$3$$$, $$$6$$$, and $$$9$$$ are lucky. To them, the fortune of a number depends on the decimal representation of the number; the fortune of a number is equal to the sum of fortunes of its digits, and the fortune of a digit depends on its value and position and can be described by the following table. For example, the number $$$319$$$ has fortune $$$F_{2} + 3F_{0}$$$.Each sheep wants to maximize thesum of fortuneamong all its $$$k$$$ written integers. Can you help them?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 999999$$$): the number of numbers each sheep has to write.The next line contains six integers $$$F_0$$$, $$$F_1$$$, $$$F_2$$$, $$$F_3$$$, $$$F_4$$$, $$$F_5$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq F_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$): the fortune assigned to each digit.The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq q \\\\leq 100\\\\,000$$$): the number of sheep.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$n_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n_i \\\\leq 999999$$$): the sum of numbers that $$$i$$$-th sheep has to write.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines, where the $$$i$$$-th line contains the maximum sum of fortune of all numbers of the $$$i$$$-th sheep.ExampleInput3 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 57 63Output11 8NoteIn the first test case, $$$57 = 9 + 9 + 39$$$. The three $$$9$$$'s contribute $$$1 \\\\cdot 3$$$ and $$$3$$$ at the tens position contributes $$$2 \\\\cdot 1$$$. Hence the sum of fortune is $$$11$$$.In the second test case, $$$63 = 35 + 19 + 9$$$. The sum of fortune is $$$8$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "cea51369", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of rules for assigning a \"fortune\" value to each digit in a number.  \n\n*  The fortune of a digit depends on its value and its position in the number.\n\nYou are also given:\n\n*  $k$: the number of numbers each person has to write.\n*  $F_0$, $F_1$, $F_2$, $F_3$, $F_4$, $F_5$: the fortune values for digits 0 through 5.\n*  $q$: the number of people.\n*  $n_i$: the sum of the numbers that the $i$-th person has to write.\n\nFor each person, find the maximum possible sum of fortunes of all the numbers they have to write."}, {"prompt_md5": "7f9a3bee", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a set of values representing the fortune of each digit in a number based on its position.
