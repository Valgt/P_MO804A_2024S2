They suggested him the problem: \"Determine how many polynomialsP(x)exist withinteger non-negativecoefficients so that, and, whereandbare given positive integers\"?Vasya does not like losing bets, but he has no idea how to solve this task, so please help him to solve the problem.InputThe input contains three integer positive numbersno greater than1018.OutputIf there is an infinite number of such polynomials, then print \"inf\"without quotes, otherwise print the reminder of an answer modulo109+ 7.ExamplesInput2 2 2Output2Input2 3 3Output1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "24ee2bea", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given three positive integers $n$, $a$, and $b$, where $n \\leq 10^{18}$, find the number of polynomials of the form $P(x) = a_0 + a_1x + ... + a_nx^n$ with non-negative integer coefficients such that:\n\n* $P(a) = b$ \n\nIf there are infinitely many such polynomials, print \"inf\".
