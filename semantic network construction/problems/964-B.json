Messagestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere arenincoming messages for Vasya. Thei-th message is going to be received aftertiminutes. Each message has a cost, which equals toAinitially. After being received, the cost of a message decreases byBeach minute (it can become negative). Vasya can read any message after receiving it at any moment of time. After reading the message, Vasya's bank account receives the current cost of this message. Initially, Vasya's bank account is at0.Also, each minute Vasya's bank account receivesC·k, wherekis the amount of received but unread messages.Vasya's messages are very important to him, and because of that he wants to have all messages read afterTminutes.Determine the maximum amount of money Vasya's bank account can hold afterTminutes.InputThe first line contains five integersn,A,B,CandT(1 ≤n,A,B,C,T≤ 1000).The second string containsnintegersti(1 ≤ti≤T).OutputOutput one integer  — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput4 5 5 3 51 5 5 4Output20Input5 3 1 1 32 2 2 1 1Output15Input5 5 3 4 51 2 3 4 5Output35NoteIn the first sample the messages must be read immediately after receiving, Vasya receivesApoints for each message,n·A= 20in total.In the second sample the messages can be read at any integer moment.In the third sample messages must be read at the moment T.
