Polycarp's Practicetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp is practicing his problem solving skill. He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.Theprofitof the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then theprofitof the day is $$$\\\\max\\\\limits_{l \\\\le i \\\\le r}a_i$$$). Thetotal profitof his practice is the sum of theprofitsover all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possibletotal profitover all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that thetotal profitis maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximumtotal profitis: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here thetotal profitequals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).OutputIn the first line of the output print the maximum possibletotal profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\\\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\\\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possibletotal profitof his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.ExamplesInput8 35 4 2 6 5 1 9 2Output203 2 3Input5 11 1 1 1 1Output15Input4 21 2000 2000 2Output40002 2NoteThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$.
