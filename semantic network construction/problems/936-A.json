Save Energy!time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputJulia is going to cook a chicken in the kitchen of her dormitory. To save energy, the stove in the kitchen automatically turns off afterkminutes after turning on.During cooking, Julia goes to the kitchen everydminutes and turns on the stove if it is turned off. While the cooker is turned off, it stays warm. The stove switches on and off instantly.It is known that the chicken needstminutes to be cooked on the stove, if it is turned on, and2tminutes, if it is turned off. You need to find out, how much time will Julia have to cook the chicken, if it is considered that the chicken is cooked evenly, with constant speed when the stove is turned on and at a constant speed when it is turned off.InputThe single line contains three integersk,dandt(1 ≤k,d,t≤ 1018).OutputPrint a single number, the total time of cooking in minutes. The relative or absolute error must not exceed10- 9.Namely, let's assume that your answer isxand the answer of the jury isy.

Then the chicken will be cooked for one minute on a turned off stove, it will be cooked for. Thus, after four minutes the chicken will be cooked for. Before the fifth minute Julia will turn on the stove and after2.5minutes the chicken will be ready.In the second example, when the stove is turned off, Julia will immediately turn it on, so the stove will always be turned on and the chicken will be cooked in 20 minutes.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c36c1656", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "A stove automatically turns off after $k$ minutes of being on.
