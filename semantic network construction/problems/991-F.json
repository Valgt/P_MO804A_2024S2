Concise and cleartime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya is a regular participant at programming contests and is already experienced in finding important sentences in long statements. Of course, numbers constraints are important — factorization of a number less than1000000is easier than of a number less than1000000000. However, sometimes it's hard to understand the number at the first glance. Could it be shortened? For example, instead of1000000you could write $$$10^{6}$$$, instead of1000000000—$$$10^{9}$$$, instead of1000000007— $$$10^{9}+7$$$.Vasya decided that, to be concise, the notation should follow several rules:the notation should only consist of numbers, operations of addition (\"+\"), multiplication (\"*\") and exponentiation (\"^\"), in particular, the use of braces is forbidden;the use of several exponentiation operations in a row is forbidden, for example, writing \"2^3^4\" is unacceptable;the value of the resulting expression equals to the initial number;the notation should consist of the minimal amount of symbols.Given $$$n$$$, find the equivalent concise notation for it.InputThe only line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000$$$).OutputOutput a concise notation of the number $$$n$$$.
