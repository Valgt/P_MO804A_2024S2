Cat, Fox and Double Maximumtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFox loves permutations! She came up with the following problem and asked Cat to solve it:You are given anevenpositive integer $$$n$$$ and a permutation$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$.The score of another permutation $$$q$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is the number oflocal maximumsin the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where $$$a_i = p_i + q_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$). In other words, the score of $$$q$$$ is the number of $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 < i < n$$$ (note thestrictinequalities), $$$a_{i-1} < a_i$$$, and $$$a_i > a_{i+1}$$$ (once again, note the strict inequalities).Find the permutation $$$q$$$ that achieves the maximum score for given $$$n$$$ and $$$p$$$. If there exist multiple such permutations, you can pick any of them.$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).InputThe first line of input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the input you will have to solve.The first line of each test case contains oneeveninteger $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$, $$$n$$$ is even) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$.The second line of each test case contains the $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq p_i \\\\leq n$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$p$$$ is a permutation of length $$$n$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one line containing any permutation of length $$$n$$$ (the array $$$q$$$), such that $$$q$$$ maximizes the score under the given constraints.ExampleInput441 2 3 444 3 1 266 5 1 4 2 381 2 4 5 7 6 8 3Output2 4 1 3 3 1 4 2 2 5 1 4 3 6 5 4 8 2 7 1 6 3NoteIn the first example, $$$a = [3, 6, 4, 7]$$$. The array has just one local maximum (on the second position), so the score of the chosen permutation $$$q$$$ is $$$1$$$. It can be proven that this score is optimal under the constraints.In the last example, the resulting array $$$a = [6, 6, 12, 7, 14, 7, 14, 6]$$$ has $$$3$$$ local maximums — on the third, fifth and seventh positions.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "36cd9ed6", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an even integer $n$ and a permutation $p$ of length $n$.  \n\nYou need to find a permutation $q$ of length $n$ that maximizes the number of local maxima in the array $a$ where $a_i = p_i + q_i$ for all $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$).\n\nA local maximum at index $i$ means $a_{i-1} < a_i$ and $a_i > a_{i+1}$ (strict inequalities).\n\nOutput any permutation $q$ that achieves the maximum score."}, {"prompt_md5": "74b02579", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given an even number and a list of numbers.
