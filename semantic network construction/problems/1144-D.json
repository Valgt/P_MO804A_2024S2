Equalize Them Alltime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. You can perform the following operations arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):Choose a pair of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$|i-j|=1$$$ (indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are adjacent) and set $$$a_i := a_i + |a_i - a_j|$$$;Choose a pair of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$|i-j|=1$$$ (indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are adjacent) and set $$$a_i := a_i - |a_i - a_j|$$$.The value $$$|x|$$$ means the absolute value of $$$x$$$. For example, $$$|4| = 4$$$, $$$|-3| = 3$$$.Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to obtain the array of equal elements and print the order of operations to do it.It is guaranteed that you always can obtain the array of equal elements using such operations.Note that after each operation each element of the current array should not exceed $$$10^{18}$$$ by absolute value.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.OutputIn the first line print one integer $$$k$$$ — the minimum number of operations required to obtain the array of equal elements.In the next $$$k$$$ lines print operations itself. The $$$p$$$-th operation should be printed as a triple of integers $$$(t_p, i_p, j_p)$$$, where $$$t_p$$$ is either $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$ ($$$1$$$ means that you perform the operation of the first type, and $$$2$$$ means that you perform the operation of the second type), and $$$i_p$$$ and $$$j_p$$$ are indices of adjacent elements of the array such that $$$1 \\\\le i_p, j_p \\\\le n$$$, $$$|i_p - j_p| = 1$$$. See the examples for better understanding.Note that after each operation each element of the current array should not exceed $$$10^{18}$$$ by absolute value.If there are many possible answers, you can print any.ExamplesInput5 2 4 6 6 6Output2 1 2 3  1 1 2Input3 2 8 10Output2 2 2 1  2 3 2Input4 1 1 1 1Output0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "71cc0d6c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
