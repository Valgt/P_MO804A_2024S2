Today he decided to finally go out and play football, but with the first hit he left a dent on the new Rolls-Royce of the wealthy businessman Big Vova. Vladimir has recently opened a store on the popular online marketplace \"Zmey-Gorynych\", and offers Alex a job: if he shows his programming skills by solving a task, he'll work as a cybersecurity specialist. Otherwise, he'll be delivering some doubtful products for the next two years.You're given $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$. Using each of themexactly at once, you're to make such sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ that sequence $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_n$$$ islexicographically maximal, where $$$c_i=GCD(b_1,\\\\dots,b_i)$$$ - the greatest common divisor of the first $$$i$$$ elements of $$$b$$$.Alexander is really afraid of the conditions of this simple task, so he asks you to solve it.A sequence $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a sequence $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:$$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \\\\ne b$$$;in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the sequence $$$a$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$b$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^3$$$)  — the length of the sequence $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,\\\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^3$$$)  — the sequence $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^3$$$.OutputFor each test case output the answer in a single line  — the desired sequence $$$b$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any.ExampleInput7 2 2 5 4 1 8 2 3 3 3 8 9 5 64 25 75 100 50 1 42 6 96 128 88 80 52 7 5 2 4 8 16 17Output5 2  8 2 1 3  9 3 8  100 50 25 75 64  42  128 96 80 88 52 7  17 2 4 8 16NoteIn the first test case of the example, there are only two possible permutations $$$b$$$  — $$$[2, 5]$$$ and $$$[5, 2]$$$: for the first one $$$c=[2, 1]$$$, for the second one $$$c=[5, 1]$$$.In the third test case of the example, number $$$9$$$ should be the first in $$$b$$$, and $$$GCD(9, 3)=3$$$, $$$GCD(9, 8)=1$$$, so the second number of $$$b$$$ should be $$$3$$$.In the seventh test case of the example, first four numbers pairwise have a common divisor (a power of two), but none of them can be the first in the optimal permutation $$$b$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6a858b94", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ positive integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
