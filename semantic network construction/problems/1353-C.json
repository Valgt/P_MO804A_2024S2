Board Movestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a board of size $$$n \\\\times n$$$, where $$$n$$$ isodd(not divisible by $$$2$$$). Initially, each cell of the board contains one figure.In one move, you can selectexactly one figurepresented in some cell and move it to one of the cellssharing a side or a corner with the current cell, i.e. from the cell $$$(i, j)$$$ you can move the figure to cells:$$$(i - 1, j - 1)$$$;$$$(i - 1, j)$$$;$$$(i - 1, j + 1)$$$;$$$(i, j - 1)$$$;$$$(i, j + 1)$$$;$$$(i + 1, j - 1)$$$;$$$(i + 1, j)$$$;$$$(i + 1, j + 1)$$$;Of course, youcan notmove figures to cells out of the board. It is allowed that after a move there will be several figures in one cell.Your task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to getall the figuresintoonecell (i.e. $$$n^2-1$$$ cells should contain $$$0$$$ figures and one cell should contain $$$n^2$$$ figures).You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 200$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n < 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the board. It is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is odd (not divisible by $$$2$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case print the answer — the minimum number of moves needed to getall the figuresintoonecell.ExampleInput3 1 5 499993Output0 40 41664916690999888", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7205de46", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a square board of size $n \\times n$ where $n$ is an odd number.
