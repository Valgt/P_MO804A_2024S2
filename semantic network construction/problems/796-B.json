More precisely, cupiis on the table at the positionx=i.The problematic bone is initially at the positionx= 1. Zane will confuse the audience by swapping the cupsktimes, thei-th time of which involves the cups at the positionsx=uiandx=vi. If the bone happens to be at the position where there is a hole at any time, it will fall into the hole onto the ground and will not be affected by future swapping operations.Do not forget that Zane is a wizard. When he swaps the cups, he does not move them ordinarily. Instead, he teleports the cups (along with the bone, if it is inside) to the intended positions. Therefore, for example, when he swaps the cup atx= 4and the one atx= 6, they will not be at the positionx= 5at any moment during the operation.Zane’s puppy, Inzane, is in trouble. Zane is away on his vacation, and Inzane cannot find his beloved bone, as it would be too exhausting to try opening all the cups. Inzane knows that the Codeforces community has successfully helped Zane, so he wants to see if it could help him solve his problem too. Help Inzane determine the final position of the bone.InputThe first line contains three integersn,m, andk(2 ≤n≤ 106,1 ≤m≤n,1 ≤k≤ 3·105) — the number of cups, the number of holes on the table, and the number of swapping operations, respectively.The second line containsmdistinctintegersh1,h2, ...,hm(1 ≤hi≤n) — the positions along thex-axis where there is a hole on the table.Each of the nextklines contains two integersuiandvi(1 ≤ui,vi≤n,ui≠vi) — the positions of the cups to be swapped.OutputPrint one integer — the final position along thex-axis of the bone.ExamplesInput7 3 43 4 61 22 55 77 1Output1Input5 1 221 22 4Output2NoteIn the first sample, after the operations, the bone becomes atx= 2,x= 5,x= 7, andx= 1, respectively.In the second sample, after the first operation, the bone becomes atx= 2, and falls into the hole onto the ground.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "97347562", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ cups numbered from 1 to $n$ placed on a line.
