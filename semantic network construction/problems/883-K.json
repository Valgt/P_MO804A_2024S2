Road Wideningtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMayor of city S just hates trees and lawns. They take so much space and there could be a road on the place they occupy!The Mayor thinks that one of the main city streets could be considerably widened on account of lawn nobody needs anyway. Moreover, that might help reduce the car jams which happen from time to time on the street.The street is split intonequal length parts from left to right, thei-th part is characterized by two integers: width of roadsiand width of lawngi.For each ofnparts the Mayor should decide the size of lawn to demolish. For thei-th part he can reduce lawn width by integerxi(0 ≤xi≤gi). After it new road width of thei-th part will be equal tos'i=si+xiand new lawn width will be equal tog'i=gi-xi.On the one hand, the Mayor wants to demolish as much lawn as possible (and replace it with road). On the other hand, he does not want to create a rapid widening or narrowing of the road, which would lead to car accidents. To avoid that, the Mayor decided that width of the road for consecutive parts should differ by at most1, i.e. for eachi(1 ≤i<n) the inequation|s'i+ 1-s'i| ≤ 1should hold. Initially this condition might not be true.You need to find the the total width of lawns the Mayor will destroy according to his plan.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 2·105) — number of parts of the street.Each of the followingnlines contains two integerssi,gi(1 ≤si≤ 106,0 ≤gi≤ 106) — current width of road and width of the lawn on thei-th part of the street.OutputIn the first line print the total width of lawns which will be removed.In the second line printnintegerss'1,s'2, ...,s'n(si≤s'i≤si+gi) — new widths of the road starting from the first part and to the last.If there is no solution, print the only integer-1in the first line.ExamplesInput34 54 54 10Output169 9 10Input41 100100 11 100100 1Output202101 101 101 101Input31 1100 1001 1Output-1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5dbf967a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a street divided into $n$ equal parts.
