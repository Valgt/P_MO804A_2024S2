Robot Collisionstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ robots driving along an OX axis. There are also two walls: one is at coordinate $$$0$$$ and one is at coordinate $$$m$$$.The $$$i$$$-th robot starts at an integer coordinate $$$x_i~(0 < x_i < m)$$$ and moves either left (towards the $$$0$$$) or right with the speed of $$$1$$$ unit per second. No two robots start at the same coordinate.Whenever a robot reaches a wall, it turns around instantly and continues his ride in the opposite direction with the same speed.Whenever several robots meet at the sameintegercoordinate, they collide and explode into dust. Once a robot has exploded, it doesn't collide with any other robot. Note that if several robots meet at a non-integer coordinate, nothing happens.For each robot find out if it ever explodes and print the time of explosion if it happens and $$$-1$$$ otherwise.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases.Then the descriptions of $$$t$$$ testcases follow.The first line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$2 \\\\le m \\\\le 10^8$$$) — the number of robots and the coordinate of the right wall.The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n$$$ ($$$0 < x_i < m$$$) — the starting coordinates of the robots.The third line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ space-separated characters 'L' or 'R' — the starting directions of the robots ('L' stands for left and 'R' stands for right).All coordinates $$$x_i$$$ in the testcase are distinct.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase print $$$n$$$ integers — for the $$$i$$$-th robot output the time it explodes at if it does and $$$-1$$$ otherwise.ExampleInput5 7 12 1 2 3 4 9 10 11 R R L L R R R 2 10 1 6 R R 2 10 1 3 L L 1 10 5 R 7 8 6 1 7 2 3 5 4 R L R L L L LOutput1 1 1 1 2 -1 2  -1 -1  2 2  -1  -1 2 7 3 2 7 3NoteHere is the picture for the seconds $$$0, 1, 2$$$ and $$$3$$$ of the first testcase:Notice that robots $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ don't collide because they meet at the same point $$$2.5$$$, which is not integer.After second $$$3$$$ robot $$$6$$$ just drive infinitely because there's no robot to collide with.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "3757c7f3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ robots moving on a line from $0$ to $m$.
