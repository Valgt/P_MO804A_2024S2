Dasha and Nightmarestime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDasha, an excellent student, is studying at the best mathematical lyceum in the country. Recently, a mysterious stranger brought $$$n$$$ words consisting of small latin letters $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_n$$$ to the lyceum. Since that day, Dasha has been tormented bynightmares.Consider some pair of integers $$$\\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le j \\\\le n$$$).A nightmareis a string for which it is true:It is obtained by concatenation $$$s_{i}s_{j}$$$;Its length isodd;The number of different letters in it isexactly$$$25$$$;The number of occurrences of each letter that is in the word isodd.For example, if $$$s_i=$$$ \"abcdefg\" and $$$s_j=$$$ \"ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\", the pair $$$\\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle$$$ creates anightmare.Dasha will stop havingnightmaresif she counts their number. There are too manynightmares, so Dasha needs your help. Count the number of differentnightmares.Nightmaresare called different if the corresponding pairs $$$\\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle$$$ are different.
