Initially, $$$a \\\\ge x$$$ and $$$b \\\\ge y$$$. You can do the following operationno more than$$$n$$$ times:Choose either $$$a$$$ or $$$b$$$ and decrease it by one. However, as a result of this operation, value of $$$a$$$ cannot become less than $$$x$$$, and value of $$$b$$$ cannot become less than $$$y$$$.Your task is to find theminimumpossible product of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$a \\\\cdot b$$$) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than $$$n$$$ times.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains five integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b, x, y, n \\\\le 10^9$$$). Additional constraint on the input: $$$a \\\\ge x$$$ and $$$b \\\\ge y$$$ always holds.OutputFor each test case, print one integer: theminimumpossible product of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$a \\\\cdot b$$$) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than $$$n$$$ times.ExampleInput7 10 10 8 5 3 12 8 8 7 2 12343 43 4543 39 123212 1000000000 1000000000 1 1 1 1000000000 1000000000 1 1 1000000000 10 11 2 1 5 10 11 9 1 10Output70 77 177177 999999999000000000 999999999 55 10NoteIn the first test case of the example, you need to decrease $$$b$$$ three times and obtain $$$10 \\\\cdot 7 = 70$$$.In the second test case of the example, you need to decrease $$$a$$$ one time, $$$b$$$ one time and obtain $$$11 \\\\cdot 7 = 77$$$.In the sixth test case of the example, you need to decrease $$$a$$$ five times and obtain $$$5 \\\\cdot 11 = 55$$$.In the seventh test case of the example, you need to decrease $$$b$$$ ten times and obtain $$$10 \\\\cdot 1 = 10$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4d44ae7a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given four numbers: $a$, $b$, $x$, and $y$.
