Touriststime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutA double tourist path, located at a park in Ultima Thule, is working by the following principle:We introduce the Cartesian coordinate system.At some points of time there are two tourists going (for a walk) from points( - 1, 0)and(1, 0)simultaneously. The first one is walking from( - 1, 0), the second one is walking from(1, 0).Both tourists in a pair move at the same speed1(distance unit per second), the first one moves along linex=  - 1, the second one moves along linex= 1, both of them are moving in the positive direction of theOyaxis.At some points of time walls appear. Wall(li,ri)is a segment between points(0,li)and(0,ri). Each wall appears immediately.The Ultima Thule government wants to learn this for each pair of tourists that walk simultaneously: for how long (in seconds) will they not see each other? Two tourists don't see each other if the segment that connects their positions on the plane intersects at least one wall. Two segments intersect if they share at least one point. We assume that the segments' ends belong to the segments.Help the government count the required time. Note that the walls can intersect (in any way) or coincide.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 105) — the number of pairs of tourists and the number of built walls. The nextmlines contain three space-separated integersli,riandtieach (0 ≤li<ri≤ 109,0 ≤ti≤ 109) — the wall ends and the time it appeared. The last line containsndistinct space-separated strictly increasing integersq1,q2, ...,qn(0 ≤qi≤ 109) — the points of time when pairs of tourists walk.All points of time are given in seconds.OutputFor each pair of tourists print on a single line a single integer — the time in seconds when the two tourists from the corresponding pair won't see each other. Print the numbers in the order in which the they go in the input.ExamplesInput2 21 4 33 6 50 1Output24Input3 30 3 40 1 22 4 01 3 4Output244", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "29d3c520", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two tourists who start walking simultaneously from points $(-1, 0)$ and $(1, 0)$ respectively.
