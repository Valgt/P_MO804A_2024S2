World of Darkraft - 2time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutRoma found a new character in the game \"World of Darkraft - 2\". In this game the character fights monsters, finds the more and more advanced stuff that lets him fight stronger monsters.The character can equip himself withkdistinct types of items. Power of each item depends on its level (positive integer number). Initially the character has one1-level item of each of thektypes.After the victory over the monster the character finds exactly one new randomly generated item. The generation process looks as follows. Firstly the type of the item is defined; each of thektypes has the same probability. Then the level of the new item is defined. Let's assume that the level of player's item of the chosen type is equal totat the moment. Level of the new item will be chosen uniformly among integers from segment [1;t+ 1].From the new item and the current player's item of the same type Roma chooses the best one (i.e. the one with greater level) and equips it (if both of them has the same level Roma choses any). The remaining item is sold for coins. Roma sells an item of levelxof any type forxcoins.Help Roma determine the expected number of earned coins after the victory overnmonsters.InputThe first line contains two integers,nandk(1 ≤n≤ 105;1 ≤k≤ 100).OutputPrint a real number — expected number of earned coins after victory overnmonsters.
