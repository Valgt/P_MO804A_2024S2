Nextnlines contain the elements of the array, one per line.Each element is a non-negative integer written inradix-based notation, possibly with leading zeros, which contains between 1 and 5 digits, inclusive. The digits of the notation will be 0, 1, ..., 9, A, B, ..., Z in the given order.OutputOutput the sum of array elements inradix-based notation.
