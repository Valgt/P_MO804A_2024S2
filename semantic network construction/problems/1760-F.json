Queststime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ quests. If you complete the $$$i$$$-th quest, you will gain $$$a_i$$$ coins. You can only complete at most one quest per day. However, once you complete a quest, you cannot do the same quest again for $$$k$$$ days. (For example, if $$$k=2$$$ and you do quest $$$1$$$ on day $$$1$$$, then you cannot do it on day $$$2$$$ or $$$3$$$, but you can do it again on day $$$4$$$.)You are given two integers $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$. Find the maximum value of $$$k$$$ such that you can gain at least $$$c$$$ coins over $$$d$$$ days. If no such $$$k$$$ exists, outputImpossible. If $$$k$$$ can be arbitrarily large, outputInfinity.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n,c,d$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\leq c \\\\leq 10^{16}$$$; $$$1 \\\\leq d \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of quests, the number of coins you need, and the number of days.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the rewards for the quests.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$d$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one of the following.If no such $$$k$$$ exists, outputImpossible.If $$$k$$$ can be arbitrarily large, outputInfinity.Otherwise, output a single integer — the maximum value of $$$k$$$ such that you can gain at least $$$c$$$ coins over $$$d$$$ days.Please note, the checker iscase-sensitive, and you should output strings exactly as they are given.ExampleInput62 5 41 22 20 10100 103 100 37 2 64 20 34 5 6 74 100000000000 20228217734 927368 26389746 6278969742 20 45 1Output2 Infinity Impossible 1 12 0NoteIn the first test case, one way to earn $$$5$$$ coins over $$$4$$$ days with $$$k=2$$$ is as follows:Day 1: do quest 2, and earn $$$2$$$ coins.Day 2: do quest 1, and earn $$$1$$$ coin.Day 3: do nothing.Day 4: do quest 2, and earn $$$2$$$ coins.In total, we earned $$$2+1+2=5$$$ coins.In the second test case, we can make over $$$20$$$ coins on the first day itself by doing the first quest to earn $$$100$$$ coins, so the value of $$$k$$$ can be arbitrarily large, since we never need to do another quest.In the third test case, no matter what we do, we can't earn $$$100$$$ coins over $$$3$$$ days.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "873e749c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have $n$ quests, each giving you $a_i$ coins when completed.
