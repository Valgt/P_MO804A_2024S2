Represent the number $$$n$$$ as the sum of $$$k$$$ positive integers of the same parity (have the same remainder when divided by $$$2$$$).In other words, find $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k$$$ such that all $$$a_i>0$$$, $$$n = a_1 + a_2 + \\\\ldots + a_k$$$ and either all $$$a_i$$$ are even or all $$$a_i$$$ are odd at the same time.If such a representation does not exist, then report it.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases in the input. Next, $$$t$$$ test cases are given, one per line.Each test case is two positive integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 100$$$).OutputFor each test case print:YESand the required values $$$a_i$$$, if the answer exists (if there are several answers, print any of them);NOif the answer does not exist.The letters in the wordsYESandNOcan be printed in any case.ExampleInput8 10 3 100 4 8 7 97 2 8 8 3 10 5 3 1000000000 9OutputYES 4 2 4 YES 55 5 5 35 NO NO YES 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 NO YES 3 1 1 YES 111111110 111111110 111111110 111111110 111111110 111111110 111111110 111111110 111111120", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4ebb6305", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two numbers,  $n$ and $k$.
