Creeptime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDefine the score of some binary string $$$T$$$ as the absolute difference between the number of zeroes and ones in it. (for example, $$$T=$$$010001contains $$$4$$$ zeroes and $$$2$$$ ones, so the score of $$$T$$$ is $$$|4-2| = 2$$$).Define the creepiness of some binary string $$$S$$$ as the maximum score among all of its prefixes (for example, the creepiness of $$$S=$$$01001is equal to $$$2$$$ because the score of the prefix $$$S[1 \\\\ldots 4]$$$ is $$$2$$$ and the rest of the prefixes have a score of $$$2$$$ or less).Given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, construct a binary string consisting of $$$a$$$ zeroes and $$$b$$$ ones with the minimum possible creepiness.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1\\\\le t\\\\le 1000)$$$  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$ 1 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 100$$$)  — the numbers of zeroes and ones correspondingly.OutputFor each test case, print a binary string consisting of $$$a$$$ zeroes and $$$b$$$ ones with the minimum possible creepiness.
