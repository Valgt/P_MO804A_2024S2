Fadi and LCMtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputToday, Osama gave Fadi an integer $$$X$$$, and Fadi was wondering about the minimum possible value of $$$max(a, b)$$$ such that $$$LCM(a, b)$$$ equals $$$X$$$. Both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ should be positive integers.$$$LCM(a, b)$$$ is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. For example, $$$LCM(6, 8) = 24$$$, $$$LCM(4, 12) = 12$$$, $$$LCM(2, 3) = 6$$$.Of course, Fadi immediately knew the answer. Can you be just like Fadi and find any such pair?InputThe first and only line contains an integer $$$X$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le X \\\\le 10^{12}$$$).OutputPrint two positive integers, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, such that the value of $$$max(a, b)$$$ is minimum possible and $$$LCM(a, b)$$$ equals $$$X$$$. If there are several possible such pairs, you can print any.ExamplesInput2Output1 2Input6Output2 3Input4Output1 4Input1Output1 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0528967f", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Find two positive numbers whose greatest value is as small as possible and whose least common multiple is a given number."}, {"prompt_md5": "47c677b3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an integer $X$, find two positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that the maximum of $a$ and $b$ is as small as possible and the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is equal to $X$. \n\nYou may output any such pair."}]}
