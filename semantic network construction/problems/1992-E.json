Novice's Mistaketime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOne of the first programming problems by K1o0n looked like this: \"Noobish_Monk has $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100)$$$ friends. Each of them gave him $$$a$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le a \\\\le 10000)$$$ apples for his birthday. Delighted with such a gift, Noobish_Monk returned $$$b$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le b \\\\le \\\\min(10000, a \\\\cdot n))$$$ apples to his friends. How many apples are left with Noobish_Monk?\"K1o0n wrote a solution, but accidentally considered the value of $$$n$$$ as a string, so the value of $$$n \\\\cdot a - b$$$ was calculated differently. Specifically:when multiplying the string $$$n$$$ by the integer $$$a$$$, he will get the string $$$s=\\\\underbrace{n + n + \\\\dots + n + n}_{a\\\\ \\\\text{times}}$$$when subtracting the integer $$$b$$$ from the string $$$s$$$, the last $$$b$$$ characters will be removed from it. If $$$b$$$ is greater than or equal to the length of the string $$$s$$$, it will become empty.Learning about this, ErnKor became interested in how many pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ exist for a given $$$n$$$, satisfying the constraints of the problem, on which K1o0n's solution gives the correct answer.\"The solution gives the correct answer\" means that it outputs anon-emptystring, and this string, when converted to an integer, equals the correct answer, i.e., the value of $$$n \\\\cdot a - b$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$)  — the number of test cases.For each test case, a single line of input contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$).It is guaranteed that in all test cases, $$$n$$$ is distinct.OutputFor each test case, output the answer in the following format:In the first line, output the integer $$$x$$$ — the number of bad tests for the given $$$n$$$.In the next $$$x$$$ lines, output two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ — such integers that K1o0n's solution on the test \"$$$n$$$ $$$a_i$$$ $$$b_i$$$\" gives the correct answer.ExampleInput32310Output3 20 18  219 216  2218 2214  1 165 162  1 1262 2519NoteIn the first example, $$$a = 20$$$, $$$b = 18$$$ are suitable, as \"$$$\\\\text{2}$$$\" $$$\\\\cdot 20 - 18 =$$$ \"$$$\\\\text{22222222222222222222}$$$\"$$$- 18 = 22 = 2 \\\\cdot 20 - 18$$$", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a291f2a3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$ (1 ≤ $n$ ≤ 100).  \n\nConsider a function that takes two integers $a$ (1 ≤ $a$ ≤ 10000) and $b$ (1 ≤ $b$ ≤ min(10000, $a \\cdot n$)) as input.\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n1.
