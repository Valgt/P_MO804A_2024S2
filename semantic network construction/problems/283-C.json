It is known that allbiare distinct and allciare distinct.Help Jessie find the number of possible combinations of coins Bessie could have. Two combinations are considered different if there is somei(1 ≤i≤n), such that the number of coins Bessie has of typeiis different in the two combinations. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo1000000007(109+ 7).If there are no possible combinations of coins totalingtcents that satisfy Bessie's conditions, output 0.InputThe first line contains three space-separated integers,n,qandt(1 ≤n≤ 300; 0 ≤q≤n; 1 ≤t≤ 105).
