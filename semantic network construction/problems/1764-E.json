Doremy's Number Linetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDoremy has two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers each, and an integer $$$k$$$.Initially, she has a number line where no integers are colored. She chooses a permutation $$$p$$$ of $$$[1,2,\\\\ldots,n]$$$ then performs $$$n$$$ moves. On the $$$i$$$-th move she does the following:Pick anuncoloredinteger $$$x$$$ on the number line such that either:$$$x \\\\leq a_{p_i}$$$; orthere exists acoloredinteger $$$y$$$ such that $$$y \\\\leq a_{p_i}$$$ and $$$x \\\\leq y+b_{p_i}$$$.Color integer $$$x$$$ with color $$$p_i$$$.Determine if the integer $$$k$$$ can be colored with color $$$1$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$$$).Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i,b_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if the point $$$k$$$ can be colored with color $$$1$$$. Otherwise, output \"NO\" (without quotes).You can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yEs\", \"yes\" and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput64 165 38 1210 715 14 168 1210 715 15 34 1610 715 15 38 124 1615 15 38 1210 71 1000000000500000000 5000000002 10000000001 9999999991 1OutputNO YES YES YES NO YESNoteFor the first test case, it is impossible to color point $$$16$$$ with color $$$1$$$.For the second test case, $$$p=[2,1,3,4]$$$ is one possible choice, the detail is shown below.On the first move, pick $$$x=8$$$ and color it with color $$$2$$$ since $$$x=8$$$ is uncolored and $$$x \\\\le a_2$$$.On the second move, pick $$$x=16$$$ and color it with color $$$1$$$ since there exists a colored point $$$y=8$$$ such that $$$y\\\\le a_1$$$ and $$$x \\\\le y + b_1$$$.On the third move, pick $$$x=0$$$ and color it with color $$$3$$$ since $$$x=0$$$ is uncolored and $$$x \\\\le a_3$$$.On the forth move, pick $$$x=-2$$$ and color it with color $$$4$$$ since $$$x=-2$$$ is uncolored and $$$x \\\\le a_4$$$.In the end, point $$$-2,0,8,16$$$ are colored with color $$$4,3,2,1$$$, respectively.For the third test case, $$$p=[2,1,4,3]$$$ is one possible choice.For the fourth test case, $$$p=[2,3,4,1]$$$ is one possible choice.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5860309f", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given two arrays of numbers and a target number.
