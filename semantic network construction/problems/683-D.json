In other words, a bar consists ofnrows withmslices of chocolate in each row.Each slice of chocolate is known to weigh 1 gram. Your task is to determine for each of theqchocolate bars whether it is possible to obtain a piece weighingpgrams by breaking the bar several (possibly zero) times. The final piece of the chocolate bar should be whole, and breaks are made along the line of slices' section for the whole length of the current piece.InputThe first line contains the positive integerq(1 ≤q≤ 100) — the number of chocolate bars.Each of the followingqlines contains three positive integersn,mandp(1 ≤n,m,p≤ 1000) — the size of the chocolate bar, and the weight of the piece which should be obtained.OutputThe output should containqlines and thei-th line must contain \"Yes\" (without the quotes), if it is possible to perform the task fori-th chocolate bar, or \"No\" otherwise.ExampleInput23 3 44 4 7OutputYesNo", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "3d1c2617", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $q$ chocolate bars.
