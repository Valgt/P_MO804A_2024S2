Yet Another Broken Keyboardtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecently, Norge found a string $$$s = s_1 s_2 \\\\ldots s_n$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters. As an exercise to improve his typing speed, he decided to type all substrings of the string $$$s$$$. Yes, all $$$\\\\frac{n (n + 1)}{2}$$$ of them!A substring of $$$s$$$ is a non-empty string $$$x = s[a \\\\ldots b] = s_{a} s_{a + 1} \\\\ldots s_{b}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a \\\\leq b \\\\leq n$$$). For example, \"auto\" and \"ton\" are substrings of \"automaton\".Shortly after the start of the exercise, Norge realized that his keyboard was broken, namely, he could use only $$$k$$$ Latin letters $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_k$$$ out of $$$26$$$.After that, Norge became interested in how many substrings of the string $$$s$$$ he could still type using his broken keyboard. Help him to find this number.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 26$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$ and the number of Latin letters still available on the keyboard.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting of exactly $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters.The third line contains $$$k$$$ space-separated distinct lowercase Latin letters $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_k$$$ — the letters still available on the keyboard.OutputPrint a single number — the number of substrings of $$$s$$$ that can be typed using only available letters $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_k$$$.ExamplesInput7 2 abacaba a bOutput12Input10 3 sadfaasdda f a dOutput21Input7 1 aaaaaaa bOutput0NoteIn the first example Norge can print substrings $$$s[1\\\\ldots2]$$$, $$$s[2\\\\ldots3]$$$, $$$s[1\\\\ldots3]$$$, $$$s[1\\\\ldots1]$$$, $$$s[2\\\\ldots2]$$$, $$$s[3\\\\ldots3]$$$, $$$s[5\\\\ldots6]$$$, $$$s[6\\\\ldots7]$$$, $$$s[5\\\\ldots7]$$$, $$$s[5\\\\ldots5]$$$, $$$s[6\\\\ldots6]$$$, $$$s[7\\\\ldots7]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "76b6bfa2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string of lowercase letters.
