Job Lookuptime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputJulia's $$$n$$$ friends want to organize a startup in a new country they moved to. They assigned each other numbers from 1 to $$$n$$$ according to the jobs they have, from the most front-end tasks to the most back-end ones. They also estimated a matrix $$$c$$$, where $$$c_{ij} = c_{ji}$$$ is the average number of messages per month between people doing jobs $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$.Now they want to make a hierarchy tree. It will be abinary treewith each node containing one member of the team. Some member will be selected as a leader of the team and will be contained in the root node. In order for the leader to be able to easily reach any subordinate, for each node $$$v$$$ of the tree, the following should apply: all members in its left subtree must have smaller numbers than $$$v$$$, and all members in its right subtree must have larger numbers than $$$v$$$.After the hierarchy tree is settled, people doing jobs $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ will be communicating via the shortest path in the tree between their nodes. Let's denote the length of this path as $$$d_{ij}$$$. Thus, the cost of their communication is $$$c_{ij} \\\\cdot d_{ij}$$$.Your task is to find a hierarchy tree that minimizes the total cost of communication over all pairs: $$$\\\\sum_{1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n} c_{ij} \\\\cdot d_{ij}$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 200$$$) – the number of team members organizing a startup.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$n$$$ integers each, $$$j$$$-th number in $$$i$$$-th line is $$$c_{ij}$$$ — the estimated number of messages per month between team members $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le c_{ij} \\\\le 10^9; c_{ij} = c_{ji}; c_{ii} = 0$$$).OutputOutput a description of a hierarchy tree that minimizes the total cost of communication. To do so, for each team member from 1 to $$$n$$$ output the number of the member in its parent node, or 0 for the leader. If there are many optimal trees, output a description of any one of them.ExampleInput4 0 566 1 0 566 0 239 30 1 239 0 1 0 30 1 0Output2 4 2 0NoteThe minimal possible total cost is $$$566 \\\\cdot 1+239 \\\\cdot 1+30 \\\\cdot 1+1 \\\\cdot 2+1 \\\\cdot 2=839$$$:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "53c45915", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a team of $n$ people, numbered from 1 to $n$.
