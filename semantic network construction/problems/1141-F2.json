Same Sum Blocks (Hard)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis problem is given in two editions, which differ exclusively in the constraints on the number $$$n$$$.You are given an array of integers $$$a[1], a[2], \\\\dots, a[n].$$$ Ablockis a sequence of contiguous (consecutive) elements $$$a[l], a[l+1], \\\\dots, a[r]$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$). Thus, a block is defined by a pair of indices $$$(l, r)$$$.Find a set of blocks $$$(l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2), \\\\dots, (l_k, r_k)$$$ such that:They do not intersect (i.e. they are disjoint). Formally, for each pair of blocks $$$(l_i, r_i)$$$ and $$$(l_j, r_j$$$) where $$$i \\\\neq j$$$ either $$$r_i < l_j$$$ or $$$r_j < l_i$$$.For each block the sum of its elements is the same. Formally, $$$$$$a[l_1]+a[l_1+1]+\\\\dots+a[r_1]=a[l_2]+a[l_2+1]+\\\\dots+a[r_2]=$$$$$$ $$$$$$\\\\dots =$$$$$$ $$$$$$a[l_k]+a[l_k+1]+\\\\dots+a[r_k].$$$$$$The number of the blocks in the set is maximum. Formally, there does not exist a set of blocks $$$(l_1', r_1'), (l_2', r_2'), \\\\dots, (l_{k'}', r_{k'}')$$$ satisfying the above two requirements with $$$k' > k$$$.The picture corresponds to the first example. Blue boxes illustrate blocks.Write a program to find such a set of blocks.InputThe first line contains integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1500$$$) — the length of the given array. The second line contains the sequence of elements $$$a[1], a[2], \\\\dots, a[n]$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^5$$$).OutputIn the first line print the integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$). The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain blocks, one per line. In each line print a pair of indices $$$l_i, r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le n$$$) — the bounds of the $$$i$$$-th block. You can print blocks in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput7 4 1 2 2 1 5 3Output3 7 7 2 3 4 5Input11 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5Output2 3 4 1 1Input4 1 1 1 1Output4 4 4 1 1 2 2 3 3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8982e222", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a[1], a[2], ..., a[n]$.  \n\nA block is a sequence of consecutive elements in the array.  \n\nFind the largest possible number of non-overlapping blocks where the sum of elements in each block is the same.\n\nOutput the number of blocks and the starting and ending index of each block."}, {"prompt_md5": "7c5991b5", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Divide an array of numbers into groups of non-overlapping sections.
