Petya and Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPetya has an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. He has learned partial sums recently, and now he can calculate the sum of elements on any segment of the array really fast. The segment is a non-empty sequence of elements standing one next to another in the array.Now he wonders what is the number of segments in his array with the sum less than $$$t$$$. Help Petya to calculate this number.More formally, you are required to calculate the number of pairs $$$l, r$$$ ($$$l \\\\le r$$$) such that $$$a_l + a_{l+1} + \\\\dots + a_{r-1} + a_r < t$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 200\\\\,000, |t| \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^{14}$$$).The second line contains a sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$|a_{i}| \\\\le 10^{9}$$$) â€” the description of Petya's array. Note that there might be negative, zero and positive elements.OutputPrint the number of segments in Petya's array with the sum of elements less than $$$t$$$.ExamplesInput5 45 -1 3 4 -1Output5Input3 0-1 2 -3Output4Input4 -1-2 1 -2 3Output3NoteIn the first example the following segments have sum less than $$$4$$$:$$$[2, 2]$$$, sum of elements is $$$-1$$$$$$[2, 3]$$$, sum of elements is $$$2$$$$$$[3, 3]$$$, sum of elements is $$$3$$$$$$[4, 5]$$$, sum of elements is $$$3$$$$$$[5, 5]$$$, sum of elements is $$$-1$$$", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c0fd5ddf", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
