Deck-Building Gametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are playing a deck-building game with your friend. There are $$$N$$$ cards, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$. Card $$$i$$$ has the value of $$$A_i$$$.You want to build two decks; one for you and one for your friend. A card cannot be inside both decks, and it is allowed to not use all $$$N$$$ cards. It is also allowed for a deck to be empty, i.e. does not contain any cards.Thepowerof a deck is represented as the bitwise XOR of the value of the cards in the deck. The power of an empty deck is $$$0$$$.The game isbalancedif both decks have the same power.Determine the number of ways to build two decks such that the game is balanced. Two ways are considered different if one of the decks contains at least one different card. Since the answer can be very large, calculate the answer modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.InputThe first line consists of an integer $$$N$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le N \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$).The following line consists of $$$N$$$ integers $$$A_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le A_i \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$).OutputOutput an integer representing the number of ways to build two decks such that the game is balanced.
