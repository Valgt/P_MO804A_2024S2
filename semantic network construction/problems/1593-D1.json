All are Sametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis problem is a simplified version of D2, but it has significant differences, so read the whole statement.Polycarp has an array of $$$n$$$ ($$$n$$$ is even) integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$. Polycarp conceived of a positive integer $$$k$$$. After that, Polycarp began performing the following operations on the array: take an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$) and reduce the number $$$a_i$$$ by $$$k$$$.After Polycarp performed some (possibly zero) number of such operations, it turned out thatallnumbers in the array became the same. Find the maximum $$$k$$$ at which such a situation is possible, or print $$$-1$$$ if such a number can be arbitrarily large.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an even integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\\\le n \\\\le 40$$$) ($$$n$$$ is even). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots a_n$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ specified in the given test cases does not exceed $$$100$$$.OutputFor each test case output on a separate line an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\\\ge 1$$$) — the maximum possible number that Polycarp used in operations on the array, or $$$-1$$$, if such a number can be arbitrarily large.ExampleInput3 6 1 5 3 1 1 5 8 -1 0 1 -1 0 1 -1 0 4 100 -1000 -1000 -1000Output2 1 1100", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5d58488a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers ($n$ is even).
