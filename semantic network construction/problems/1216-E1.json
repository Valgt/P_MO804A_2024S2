Numerical Sequence (easy version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe only difference between the easy and the hard versions is the maximum value of $$$k$$$.You are given aninfinitesequence of form \"112123123412345$$$\\\\dots$$$\" which consist of blocks of all consecutive positive integers written one after another. The first block consists of all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$1$$$, the second one — from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$, the third one — from $$$1$$$ to $$$3$$$, $$$\\\\dots$$$, the $$$i$$$-th block consists of all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$i$$$.So the first $$$56$$$ elements of the sequence are \"11212312341234512345612345671234567812345678912345678910\". Elements of the sequence are numbered from one. For example, the $$$1$$$-st element of the sequence is $$$1$$$, the $$$3$$$-rd element of the sequence is $$$2$$$, the $$$20$$$-th element of the sequence is $$$5$$$, the $$$38$$$-th element is $$$2$$$, the $$$56$$$-th element of the sequence is $$$0$$$.Your task is to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries. In the $$$i$$$-th query you are given one integer $$$k_i$$$. Calculate the digit at the position $$$k_i$$$ of the sequence.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 500$$$) — the number of queries.The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains one integer $$$k_i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le k_i \\\\le 10^9)$$$ — the description of the corresponding query.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines. In the $$$i$$$-th line print one digit $$$x_i$$$ $$$(0 \\\\le x_i \\\\le 9)$$$ — the answer to the query $$$i$$$, i.e. $$$x_i$$$ should be equal to the element at the position $$$k_i$$$ of the sequence.ExamplesInput5 1 3 20 38 56Output1 2 5 2 0Input4 2132 506 999999999 1000000000Output8 2 9 8NoteAnswers on queries from the first example are described in the problem statement.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d5295226", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of numbers that follows a pattern:\n\n* The first block contains the numbers from 1 to 1.\n* The second block contains the numbers from 1 to 2.\n* The third block contains the numbers from 1 to 3.\n* And so on...\n\nFor example, the first 56 numbers in the sequence are: 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nYou are given $q$ queries.
