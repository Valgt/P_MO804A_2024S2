K-Periodic Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThis task will exclusively concentrate only on the arrays where all elements equal 1 and/or 2.Arrayaisk-period if its length is divisible bykand there is such arraybof lengthk, thatais represented by arraybwritten exactlytimes consecutively. In other words, arrayaisk-periodic, if it has period of lengthk.For example, any array isn-periodic, wherenis the array length. Array[2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]is at the same time 2-periodic and 6-periodic and array[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]is at the same time 3-periodic and 9-periodic.For the given arraya, consisting only of numbers one and two, find the minimum number of elements to change to make the arrayk-periodic. If the array already isk-periodic, then the required value equals0.InputThe first line of the input contains a pair of integersn,k(1 ≤k≤n≤ 100), wherenis the length of the array and the valuenis divisible byk. The second line contains the sequence of elements of the given arraya1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 2),aiis thei-th element of the array.OutputPrint the minimum number of array elements we need to change to make the arrayk-periodic.

In this case the array will look as[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]— this array is simultaneously 1-, 3- and 9-periodic.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "07e869a2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers containing only 1s and 2s.
