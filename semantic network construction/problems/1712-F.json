A weighted tree has a weight assigned to each edge. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to this vertex.You are given a weighted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices, each edge has a weight of $$$1$$$. Let $$$L$$$ be the set of vertices with degree equal to $$$1$$$.You have to answer $$$q$$$independentqueries. In the $$$i$$$-th query:You are given a positive integer $$$x_i$$$.For all $$$u,v \\\\in L$$$ such that $$$u < v$$$, add edge $$$(u, v)$$$ with weight $$$x_i$$$ to the graph (initially the given tree).Find the diameter of the resulting graph.The diameter of a graph is equal to $$$\\\\max\\\\limits_{1 \\\\le u < v \\\\le n}{\\\\operatorname{d}(u, v)}$$$, where $$$\\\\operatorname{d}(u, v)$$$ is the length of the shortest path between vertex $$$u$$$ and vertex $$$v$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^6$$$).The second line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2,p_3,\\\\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i < i$$$) indicating that there is an edge between vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$p_i$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.The third line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 10$$$).The fourth line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i \\\\le n$$$). All $$$x_i$$$ aredistinct.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ integers in a single line — the answers to the queries.ExamplesInput4 1 2 2 4 1 2 3 4Output1 2 2 2Input7 1 2 3 4 2 1 7 2 1 3 7 5 6 4Output3 3 4 5 5 5 4Input3 1 2 1 1Output1NoteThe graph in the first test after adding the edges:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "982e705f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ vertices.
