Lucky Subsequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutPetya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits4and7. For example, numbers47,744,4are lucky and5,17,467are not.Petya has sequenceaconsisting ofnintegers.The subsequence of the sequenceais such subsequence that can be obtained fromaby removing zero or more of its elements.Two sequences are considered different if index sets of numbers included in them are different. That is, the values ​of the elements ​do not matter in the comparison of subsequences. In particular, any sequence of lengthnhas exactly2ndifferent subsequences (including an empty subsequence).A subsequence is considered lucky if it has a length exactlykand does not contain two identical lucky numbers (unlucky numbers can be repeated any number of times).Help Petya find the number of different lucky subsequences of the sequencea. As Petya's parents don't let him play with large numbers, you should print the result modulo prime number1000000007(109+ 7).InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤k≤n≤ 105). The next line containsnintegersai(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — the sequencea.OutputOn the single line print the single number — the answer to the problem modulo prime number1000000007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput3 210 10 10Output3Input4 24 4 7 7Output4NoteIn the first sample all3subsequences of the needed length are considered lucky.In the second sample there are4lucky subsequences.
