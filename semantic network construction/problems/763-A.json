Timofey and a treetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEach New Year Timofey and his friends cut down a tree ofnvertices and bring it home. After that they paint all thenits vertices, so that thei-th vertex gets colorci.Now it's time for Timofey birthday, and his mother asked him to remove the tree. Timofey removes the tree in the following way: he takes some vertex in hands, while all the other vertices move down so that the tree becomes rooted at the chosen vertex. After that Timofey brings the tree to a trash can.Timofey doesn't like it when many colors are mixing together. A subtree annoys him if there are vertices of different color in it. Timofey wants to find a vertex which he should take in hands so that there are no subtrees that annoy him. He doesn't consider the whole tree as a subtree since he can't see the color of the root vertex.A subtree of some vertex is a subgraph containing that vertex and all its descendants.Your task is to determine if there is a vertex, taking which in hands Timofey wouldn't be annoyed.InputThe first line contains single integern(2 ≤n≤ 105) — the number of vertices in the tree.Each of the nextn- 1lines contains two integersuandv(1 ≤u,v≤n,u≠v), denoting there is an edge between verticesuandv. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.The next line containsnintegersc1,c2, ...,cn(1 ≤ci≤ 105), denoting the colors of the vertices.OutputPrint \"NO\" in a single line, if Timofey can't take the tree in such a way that it doesn't annoy him.Otherwise print \"YES\" in the first line. In the second line print the index of the vertex which Timofey should take in hands. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput41 22 33 41 2 1 1OutputYES2Input31 22 31 2 3OutputYES2Input41 22 33 41 2 1 2OutputNO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9120da63", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ vertices, where each vertex has a color.  \n\nYou can choose any vertex to be the root of the tree.  \n\nA subtree is annoying if it contains vertices of different colors.\n\nFind a vertex that, when chosen as the root, results in no annoying subtrees.
