Today he's gottfree minutes to read. That's why Valera tooknbooks in the library and for each book he estimated the time he is going to need to read it. Let's number the books by integers from 1 ton. Valera needsaiminutes to read thei-th book.Valera decided to choose an arbitrary book with numberiand read the books one by one, starting from this book. In other words, he will first read book numberi, then book numberi+ 1, then book numberi+ 2and so on. He continues the process until he either runs out of the free time or finishes reading then-th book. Valera reads each book up to the end, that is, he doesn't start reading the book if he doesn't have enough free time to finish reading it.Print the maximum number of books Valera can read.InputThe first line contains two integersnandt(1 ≤n≤ 105; 1 ≤t≤ 109)— the number of books and the number of free minutes Valera's got.
