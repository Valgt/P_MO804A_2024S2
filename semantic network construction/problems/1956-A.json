Nene's Gametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k$$$.In this game, initially $$$n$$$ players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds of this game, the following happens:Nene finds the $$$a_1$$$-th, $$$a_2$$$-th, $$$\\\\ldots$$$, $$$a_k$$$-th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the $$$i$$$-th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than $$$i$$$ players in a row, they are skipped.Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are still in the game are declared as winners.For example, consider the game with $$$a=[3, 5]$$$ and $$$n=5$$$ players. Let the players be named playerA, playerB, $$$\\\\ldots$$$, playerEin the order they are lined up initially. Then,Before the first round, players are lined up asABCDE. Nene finds the $$$3$$$-rd and the $$$5$$$-th players in a row. These are playersCandE. They are kicked out in the first round.Now players are lined up asABD. Nene finds the $$$3$$$-rd and the $$$5$$$-th players in a row. The $$$3$$$-rd player is playerDand there is no $$$5$$$-th player in a row. Thus, only playerDis kicked out in the second round.In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round.PlayersAandBare declared as the winners.Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene gave you $$$q$$$ integers $$$n_1, n_2, \\\\ldots, n_q$$$ and you should answer the following question for each $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le q$$$independently:How many people would be declared as winners if there are $$$n_i$$$ players in the game initially?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 250$$$). The description of test cases follows.The first line case contains two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k, q \\\\le 100$$$) — the length of the sequence $$$a$$$ and the number of values $$$n_i$$$ you should solve this problem for.The second line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_k$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq a_1<a_2<\\\\ldots<a_k\\\\leq 100$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$.The third line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$n_1,n_2,\\\\ldots,n_q$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq n_i \\\\leq 100$$$).OutputFor each test case, output $$$q$$$ integers: the $$$i$$$-th ($$$1\\\\le i \\\\le q$$$) of them should be the number of players declared as winners if initially $$$n_i$$$ players join the game.ExampleInput62 13 555 32 4 6 7 91 3 55 43 4 5 6 71 2 3 42 369 961 10 1001 1100503 310 20 301 10 100Output2  1 1 1  1 2 2 2  1 10 68  50  1 9 9NoteThe first test case was explained in the statement.In the second test case, when $$$n=1$$$, the only player stays in the game in the first round.
