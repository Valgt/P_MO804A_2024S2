Cupboard and Balloonstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutA girl named Xenia has a cupboard that looks like an arc from ahead. The arc is made of a semicircle with radiusr(the cupboard's top) and two walls of heighth(the cupboard's sides). The cupboard's depth isr, that is, it looks like a rectangle with baserand heighth+rfrom the sides. The figure below shows what the cupboard looks like (the front view is on the left, the side view is on the right).Xenia got lots of balloons for her birthday. The girl hates the mess, so she wants to store the balloons in the cupboard. Luckily, each balloon is a sphere with radius. Help Xenia calculate the maximum number of balloons she can put in her cupboard.You can say that a balloon is in the cupboard if you can't see any part of the balloon on the left or right view. The balloons in the cupboard can touch each other. It is not allowed to squeeze the balloons or deform them in any way. You can assume that the cupboard's walls are negligibly thin.InputThe single line contains two integersr,h(1 ≤r,h≤ 107).OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum number of balloons Xenia can put in the cupboard.ExamplesInput1 1Output3Input1 2Output5Input2 1Output2", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f70629a4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "A cupboard is shaped like a semicircle with radius $r$ at the top and two walls of height $h$.
