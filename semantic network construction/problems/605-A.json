Sorting Railway Carstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAn infinitely long railway has a train consisting ofncars, numbered from1ton(the numbers of all the cars are distinct) and positioned in arbitrary order. David Blaine wants to sort the railway cars in the order of increasing numbers. In one move he can make one of the cars disappear from its place and teleport it either to the beginning of the train, or to the end of the train, at his desire.
