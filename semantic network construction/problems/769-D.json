Vasya consider the pair of integersxandyk-interesting, if their binary representation differs from each other exactly inkbits. For example, ifk= 2, the pair of integersx= 5andy= 3isk-interesting, because their binary representationx=101andy=011differs exactly in two bits.Vasya wants to know how many pairs of indexes (i,j) are in his sequence so thati<jand the pair of integersaiandajisk-interesting. Your task is to help Vasya and determine this number.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(2 ≤n≤ 105,0 ≤k≤ 14) — the number of integers in Vasya's sequence and the number of bits in which integers ink-interestingpair should differ.The second line contains the sequencea1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤ 104), which Vasya has.OutputPrint the number of pairs (i,j) so thati<jand the pair of integersaiandajisk-interesting.ExamplesInput4 10 3 2 1Output4Input6 0200 100 100 100 200 200Output6NoteIn the first test there are 4k-interestingpairs:(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4).In the second testk= 0. Consequently, integers in anyk-interestingpair should be equal to themselves.
