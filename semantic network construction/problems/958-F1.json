Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. Master Heidi needs to select the Jedi Knights who will go on peacekeeping missions throughout the galaxy. It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission.Heidi hasnJedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one ofmpossible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactlyk1knights with lightsabers of the first color,k2knights with lightsabers of the second color,...,kmknights with lightsabers of them-th color.
