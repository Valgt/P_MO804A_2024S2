PolandBall and his friends will be giving themselves gifts. There arenBalls overall. Each Ball has someone for whom he should bring a present according to some permutationp,pi≠ifor alli.Unfortunately, Balls are quite clumsy. We know earlier that exactlykof them will forget to bring their gift. A Ball numberiwill get his present if the following two constraints will hold:Ball numberiwill bring the present he should give.Ballxsuch thatpx=iwill bring his present.What is minimum and maximum possible number of kids who willnotget their present if exactlykBalls will forget theirs?InputThe first line of input contains two integersnandk(2 ≤n≤ 106,0 ≤k≤n), representing the number of Balls and the number of Balls who will forget to bring their presents.The second line contains the permutationpof integers from1ton, wherepiis the index of Ball who should get a gift from thei-th Ball. For alli,pi≠iholds.OutputYou should output two values — minimum and maximum possible number of Balls who willnotget their presents, in that order.ExamplesInput5 23 4 1 5 2Output2 4Input10 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1Output2 2NoteIn the first sample, if the third and the first balls will forget to bring their presents, they will be th only balls not getting a present. Thus the minimum answer is2. However, if the first ans the second balls will forget to bring their presents, then only the fifth ball will get a present. So, the maximum answer is4.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "922d86f2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ people.
