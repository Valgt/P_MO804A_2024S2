Linguisticstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlina has discovered a weird language, which contains only $$$4$$$ words: $$$\\\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{AB}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{BA}$$$. It also turned out that there are no spaces in this language: a sentence is written by just concatenating its words into a single string.Alina has found one such sentence $$$s$$$ and she is curious: is it possible that it consists of precisely $$$a$$$ words $$$\\\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$b$$$ words $$$\\\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$c$$$ words $$$\\\\texttt{AB}$$$, and $$$d$$$ words $$$\\\\texttt{BA}$$$?In other words, determine, if it's possible to concatenate these $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words in some order so that the resulting string is $$$s$$$. Each of the $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words must be used exactly once in the concatenation, but you can choose the order in which they are concatenated.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ ($$$0\\\\le a,b,c,d\\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of times that words $$$\\\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{AB}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{BA}$$$ respectively must be used in the sentence.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$s$$$ consists only of the characters $$$\\\\texttt{A}$$$ and $$$\\\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$1\\\\le |s| \\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$|s|=a+b+2c+2d$$$)  — the sentence. Notice that the condition $$$|s|=a+b+2c+2d$$$ (here $$$|s|$$$ denotes the length of the string $$$s$$$) is equivalent to the fact that $$$s$$$ is as long as the concatenation of the $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words.The sum of the lengths of $$$s$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case output $$$\\\\texttt{YES}$$$ if it is possible that the sentence $$$s$$$ consists of precisely $$$a$$$ words $$$\\\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$b$$$ words $$$\\\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$c$$$ words $$$\\\\texttt{AB}$$$, and $$$d$$$ words $$$\\\\texttt{BA}$$$, and $$$\\\\texttt{NO}$$$ otherwise. You can output each letter in any case.ExampleInput8 1 0 0 0 B 0 0 1 0 AB 1 1 0 1 ABAB 1 0 1 1 ABAAB 1 1 2 2 BAABBABBAA 1 1 2 3 ABABABBAABAB 2 3 5 4 AABAABBABAAABABBABBBABB 1 3 3 10 BBABABABABBBABABABABABABAABABAOutputNO YES YES YES YES YES NO YESNoteIn the first test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\\\texttt{B}$$$. Clearly, it can't consist of a single word $$$\\\\texttt{A}$$$, so the answer is $$$\\\\texttt{NO}$$$.In the second test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\\\texttt{AB}$$$, and it's possible that it consists of a single word $$$\\\\texttt{AB}$$$, so the answer is $$$\\\\texttt{YES}$$$.In the third test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\\\texttt{ABAB}$$$, and it's possible that it consists of one word $$$\\\\texttt{A}$$$, one word $$$\\\\texttt{B}$$$, and one word $$$\\\\texttt{BA}$$$, as $$$\\\\texttt{A} + \\\\texttt{BA} + \\\\texttt{B} = \\\\texttt{ABAB}$$$.In the fourth test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\\\texttt{ABAAB}$$$, and it's possible that it consists of one word $$$\\\\texttt{A}$$$, one word $$$\\\\texttt{AB}$$$, and one word $$$\\\\texttt{BA}$$$, as $$$\\\\texttt{A} + \\\\texttt{BA} + \\\\texttt{AB} = \\\\texttt{ABAAB}$$$.In the fifth test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\\\texttt{BAABBABBAA}$$$, and it's possible that it consists of one word $$$\\\\texttt{A}$$$, one word $$$\\\\texttt{B}$$$, two words $$$\\\\texttt{AB}$$$, and two words $$$\\\\texttt{BA}$$$, as $$$\\\\texttt{BA} + \\\\texttt{AB} + \\\\texttt{B} + \\\\texttt{AB} + \\\\texttt{BA} + \\\\texttt{A}= \\\\texttt{BAABBABBAA}$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ccd851b0", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a string made up of only the letters A and B.
