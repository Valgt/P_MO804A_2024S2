The other participant is not in front of Timur because he ran a shorter distance than Timur.For the second test case, no one is in front of Timur, since he ran a distance of $$$10000$$$ while all others ran a distance of $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, and $$$2$$$ respectively.For the third test case, only the second person is in front of Timur, who ran a total distance of $$$600$$$ while Timur ran a distance of $$$500$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "82b430a5", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given four distinct numbers representing the distances run by four people in a race.
