Problem for Nazartime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNazar, a student of the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland, is known for his outstanding mathematical abilities. Today a math teacher gave him avery difficult task.Consider two infinite sets of numbers. The first set consists of odd positive numbers ($$$1, 3, 5, 7, \\\\ldots$$$), and the second set consists of even positive numbers ($$$2, 4, 6, 8, \\\\ldots$$$). At the first stage, the teacher writes the first number on the endless blackboard from the first set, in the second stage — the first two numbers from the second set, on the third stage — the next four numbers from the first set, on the fourth — the next eight numbers from the second set and so on. In other words, at each stage, starting from the second, he writes outtwo times morenumbers than at the previous one, and alsochanges the setfrom which these numbers are written outto another.The ten first written numbers: $$$1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 6, 8, 10$$$. Let's number the numbers written, startingwith one.The task is to find the sum of numbers with numbers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ for given integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. The answer may be big, so you need to find the remainder of the division by $$$1000000007$$$ ($$$10^9+7$$$).Nazar thought about this problem for a long time, but didn't come up with a solution. Help him solve this problem.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$) — the range in which you need to find the sum.OutputPrint a single integer — the answer modulo $$$1000000007$$$ ($$$10^9+7$$$).ExamplesInput1 3Output7Input5 14Output105Input88005553535 99999999999Output761141116NoteIn the first example, the answer is the sum of the first three numbers written out ($$$1 + 2 + 4 = 7$$$).In the second example, the numbers with numbers from $$$5$$$ to $$$14$$$: $$$5, 7, 9, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18$$$. Their sum is $$$105$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "efa90546", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two infinite sets of numbers:\n\n* Set 1: Odd positive numbers ($1, 3, 5, 7, ...$)\n* Set 2: Even positive numbers ($2, 4, 6, 8, ...$)\n\nA sequence of numbers is generated as follows:\n\n* Stage 1: Write the first number from Set 1.\n* Stage 2: Write the first two numbers from Set 2.\n* Stage 3: Write the next four numbers from Set 1.\n* Stage 4: Write the next eight numbers from Set 2.\n* And so on...\n\nYou are given two integers,  $l$ and $r$ ($1 \\le l \\le r$).
