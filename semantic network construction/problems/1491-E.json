Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.We call a tree aFib-tree, if its number of vertices equals $$$F_k$$$ for some $$$k$$$, and at least one of the following conditions holds:The tree consists of only $$$1$$$ vertex;You can divide it into two Fib-trees by removing some edge of the tree.Determine whether the given tree is a Fib-tree or not.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the number of vertices in the tree.Then $$$n-1$$$ lines follow, each of which contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq u,v \\\\leq n$$$, $$$u \\\\neq v$$$), representing an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It's guaranteed that given edges form a tree.OutputPrint\"YES\"if the given tree is a Fib-tree, or\"NO\"otherwise.You can print your answer in any case. For example, if the answer is \"YES\", then the output \"Yes\" or \"yeS\" will also be considered as correct answer.ExamplesInput3 1 2 2 3OutputYESInput5 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5OutputNOInput5 1 3 1 2 4 5 3 4OutputYESNoteIn the first sample, we can cut the edge $$$(1, 2)$$$, and the tree will be split into $$$2$$$ trees of sizes $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ correspondently. Any tree of size $$$2$$$ is a Fib-tree, as it can be split into $$$2$$$ trees of size $$$1$$$.In the second sample, no matter what edge we cut, the tree will be split into $$$2$$$ trees of sizes $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$. As $$$4$$$ isn't $$$F_k$$$ for any $$$k$$$, it's not Fib-tree.In the third sample, here is one possible order of cutting the edges so that all the trees in the process are Fib-trees: $$$(1, 3), (1, 2), (4, 5), (3, 4)$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f15f2569", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a tree with a certain number of nodes, determine if it can be divided into smaller trees where the number of nodes in each smaller tree is a Fibonacci number."}, {"prompt_md5": "0d0f9adc", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ vertices.
