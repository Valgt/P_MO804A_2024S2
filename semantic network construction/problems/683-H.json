Exchange of Bookstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputnpupils, who love to read books, study at school. It is known that each student has exactly one best friend, and each pupil is the best friend of exactly one other pupil. Each of the pupils has exactly one interesting book.The pupils decided to share books with each other. Every day, all pupils give their own books to their best friends. Thus, every day each of the pupils has exactly one book.Your task is to use the list of the best friends and determine the exchange of books among pupils afterkdays. For simplicity, all students are numbered from 1 tonin all tests.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(2 ≤n≤ 100000, 1 ≤k≤ 1016) — the number of pupils and days during which they will exchange books.The second line containsndifferent integersai(1 ≤ai≤n), whereaiis equal to the number of the pupil who has the best friend with the numberi.It is guaranteed that no pupil is the best friend of himself.OutputIn a single line printndifferent integers, wherei-th integer should be equal to the number of the pupil who will have the book, which the pupil with the numberihad in the beginning, afterkdays.ExamplesInput4 12 4 1 3Output3 1 4 2Input5 53 4 5 2 1Output3 4 5 2 1Input6 182 3 5 1 6 4Output1 2 3 4 5 6NoteThe explanation to the first test.There are 4 pupils and 1 day. The list of the best friends equals to {2, 4, 1, 3}. It means that:the pupil with the number 3 — is the best friend of pupil with the number 1,the pupil with the number 1 — is the best friend of pupil with the number 2,the pupil with the number 4 — is the best friend of pupil with the number 3,the pupil with the number 2 — is the best friend of pupil with the number 4.After the first day the exchange of books will be {3, 1, 4, 2}.the pupil with the number 3 will have the book, which the pupil with the number 1 had in the beginning,the pupil with the number 1 will have the book, which the pupil with the number 2 had in the beginning,the pupil with the number 4 will have the book, which the pupil with the number 3 had in the beginningthe pupil with the number 2 will have the book, which the pupil with the number 4 had in the beginning.Thus, the answer is3 1 4 2.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8da6060b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of $n$ students, where each student has one best friend.
