Sagheer and Nubian Markettime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOn his trip to Luxor and Aswan, Sagheer went to a Nubian market to buy some souvenirs for his friends and relatives. The market has some strange rules. It containsndifferent items numbered from1ton. Thei-th item has base costaiEgyptian pounds. If Sagheer buyskitems with indicesx1,x2, ...,xk, then the cost of itemxjisaxj+xj·kfor1 ≤j≤k. In other words, the cost of an item is equal to its base cost in addition to its index multiplied by the factork.Sagheer wants to buy as many souvenirs as possible without paying more thanSEgyptian pounds. Note that he cannot buy a souvenir more than once. If there are many ways to maximize the number of souvenirs, he will choose the way that will minimize the total cost. Can you help him with this task?InputThe first line contains two integersnandS(1 ≤n≤ 105and1 ≤S≤ 109) — the number of souvenirs in the market and Sagheer's budget.The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 105) — the base costs of the souvenirs.OutputOn a single line, print two integersk,T— the maximum number of souvenirs Sagheer can buy and the minimum total cost to buy theseksouvenirs.ExamplesInput3 112 3 5Output2 11Input4 1001 2 5 6Output4 54Input1 77Output0 0NoteIn the first example, he cannot take the three items because they will cost him[5, 9, 14]with total cost28. If he decides to take only two items, then the costs will be[4, 7, 11]. So he can afford the first and second items.In the second example, he can buy all items as they will cost him[5, 10, 17, 22].In the third example, there is only one souvenir in the market which will cost him8pounds, so he cannot buy it.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c9802039", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ items for sale, each with a base cost $a_i$.
