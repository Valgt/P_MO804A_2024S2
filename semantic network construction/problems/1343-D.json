All $$$a_i$$$ does not exceed some integer $$$k$$$.Your task is to replace theminimumnumber of elements (replacement is the following operation: choose some index $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and replace $$$a_i$$$ with some integer in range $$$[1; k]$$$) to satisfy the following conditions:after all replacements, all $$$a_i$$$ are positive integers not greater than $$$k$$$;for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ the following equation is true: $$$a_i + a_{n - i + 1} = x$$$, where $$$x$$$ should bethe samefor all $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ pairs of elements.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5, 1 \\\\le k \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$ and the maximum possible value of some $$$a_i$$$ correspondingly. It is guratanteed that $$$n$$$ is even (i.e. divisible by $$$2$$$). The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le k$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ (as well as the sum of $$$k$$$) over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$\\\\sum k \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — theminimumnumber of elements you have to replace in $$$a$$$ to satisfy the conditions from the problem statement.ExampleInput4 4 2 1 2 1 2 4 3 1 2 2 1 8 7 6 1 1 7 6 3 4 6 6 6 5 2 6 1 3 4Output0 1 4 2", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b514b811", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers ($n$ is even).
