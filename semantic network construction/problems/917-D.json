Stranger Treestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWill shares a psychic connection with the Upside Down Monster, so everything the monster knows, Will knows. Suddenly, he started drawing, page after page, non-stop. Joyce, his mom, and Chief Hopper put the drawings together, and they realized, it's a labeled tree!A tree is a connected acyclic graph. Will's tree hasnvertices. Joyce and Hopper don't know what that means, so they're investigating this tree and similar trees. For eachksuch that0 ≤k≤n- 1, they're going to investigate all labeled trees withnvertices that share exactlykedges with Will's tree. Two labeled trees are different if and only if there's a pair of vertices(v,u)such that there's an edge betweenvanduin one tree and not in the other one.Hopper and Joyce want to know how much work they have to do, so they asked you to tell them the number of labeled trees withnvertices that share exactlykedges with Will's tree, for eachk. The answer could be very large, so they only asked you to tell them the answers modulo1000000007 = 109+ 7.InputThe first line of input contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 100) — the size of the tree.The nextn- 1lines contain the edges of Will's tree. Each line contains two integersvandu(1 ≤v,u≤n,v≠u), endpoints of an edge. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.OutputPrintnintegers in one line.i-th integer should be the number of the number of labeled trees withnvertices that share exactlyi- 1edges with Will's tree, modulo1000 000 007 = 109+ 7.ExamplesInput31 21 3Output0 2 1Input41 22 33 4Output1 7 7 1Input41 21 31 4Output0 9 6 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "721d935e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ vertices.  \n\nFor each $k$ from 0 to $n-1$, find the number of different labeled trees with $n$ vertices that share exactly $k$ edges with the given tree.
