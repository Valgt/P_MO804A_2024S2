Collecting Beats is Funtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutCucumber boy is fan of Kyubeat, a famous music game.Kyubeat has16panels for playing arranged in4 × 4table. When a panel lights up, he has to press that panel.Each panel has atimingto press (the preffered time when a player should press it), and Cucumber boy is able to press at mostkpanels in a time with his one hand. Cucumber boy is trying to press all panels in perfect timing, that is he wants to press each panel exactly in its preffered time. If he cannot press the panels with histwo handsin perfect timing, his challenge to press all the panels in perfect timing will fail.You are given one scene of Kyubeat's panel from the music Cucumber boy is trying. Tell him is he able to press all the panels in perfect timing.InputThe first line contains a single integerk(1 ≤k≤ 5) — the number of panels Cucumber boy can press with his one hand.Next 4 lines contain 4 characters each (digits from 1 to 9, or period) — table of panels. If a digitiwas written on the panel, it means the boy has to press that panel in timei. If period was written on the panel, he doesn't have to press that panel.OutputOutput \"YES\" (without quotes), if he is able to press all the panels in perfect timing. If not, output \"NO\" (without quotes).ExamplesInput1.135124734685789OutputYESInput5..1.1111..1...1.OutputYESInput1....12.1.2...2..OutputNONoteIn the third sample boy cannot press all panels in perfect timing.
