Let's Play the Hat?time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe Hat is a game of speedy explanation/guessing words (similar to Alias). It's fun. Try it! In this problem, we are talking about a variant of the game when the players are sitting at the table and everyone plays individually (i.e. not teams, but individual gamers play).$$$n$$$ people gathered in a room with $$$m$$$ tables ($$$n \\\\ge 2m$$$). They want to play the Hat $$$k$$$ times. Thus, $$$k$$$ games will be played at each table. Each player will play in $$$k$$$ games.To do this, they are distributed among the tables for each game. During each game, one player plays at exactly one table. A player can play at different tables.Players want to have the most \"fair\" schedule of games. For this reason, they are looking for a schedule (table distribution for each game) such that:At any table in each game there are either $$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{n}{m}\\\\rfloor$$$ people or $$$\\\\lceil\\\\frac{n}{m}\\\\rceil$$$ people (that is, either $$$n/m$$$ rounded down, or $$$n/m$$$ rounded up). Different numbers of people can play different games at the same table.Let's calculate for each player the value $$$b_i$$$ — the number of times the $$$i$$$-th player played at a table with $$$\\\\lceil\\\\frac{n}{m}\\\\rceil$$$ persons ($$$n/m$$$ rounded up). Any two values of $$$b_i$$$must differ by no more than $$$1$$$. In other words, for any two players $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, it must be true $$$|b_i - b_j| \\\\le 1$$$.For example, if $$$n=5$$$, $$$m=2$$$ and $$$k=2$$$, then at the request of the first item either two players or three players should play at each table. Consider the following schedules:First game: $$$1, 2, 3$$$ are played at the first table, and $$$4, 5$$$ at the second one. The second game: at the first table they play $$$5, 1$$$, and at the second  — $$$2, 3, 4$$$. This schedule isnot \"fair\"since $$$b_2=2$$$ (the second player played twice at a big table) and $$$b_5=0$$$ (the fifth player did not play at a big table).First game: $$$1, 2, 3$$$ are played at the first table, and $$$4, 5$$$ at the second one. The second game: at the first table they play $$$4, 5, 2$$$, and at the second one  — $$$1, 3$$$. This schedule is\"fair\": $$$b=[1,2,1,1,1]$$$ (any two values of $$$b_i$$$ differ by no more than $$$1$$$).Find any \"fair\" game schedule for $$$n$$$ people if they play on the $$$m$$$ tables of $$$k$$$ games.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test.Each test case consists of one line that contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le \\\\lfloor\\\\frac{n}{2}\\\\rfloor$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of people, tables and games, respectively.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$nk$$$ ($$$n$$$ multiplied by $$$k$$$) over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print a required schedule  — a sequence of $$$k$$$ blocks of $$$m$$$ lines. Each block corresponds to one game, a line in a block corresponds to one table. In each line print the number of players at the table and the indices of the players (numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$) who should play at this table.If there are several required schedules, then output any of them. We can show that a valid solution always exists.You can output additional blank lines to separate responses to different sets of inputs.ExampleInput3 5 2 2 8 3 1 2 1 3Output3 1 2 3 2 4 5 3 4 5 2 2 1 3  2 6 2 3 3 5 1 3 4 7 8  2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c6b92e40", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ people and $m$ tables.
