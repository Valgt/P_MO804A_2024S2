Make APtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp has $$$3$$$ positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$. He can perform the following operationexactly once.Choose apositiveinteger $$$m$$$ and multiplyexactly oneof the integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ or $$$c$$$ by $$$m$$$.Can Polycarp make it so that after performing the operation, the sequence of three numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ (in this order) forms anarithmetic progression? Note that youcannot changethe order of $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$.Formally, a sequence $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n$$$ is called an arithmetic progression (AP) if there exists a number $$$d$$$ (called \"common difference\") such that $$$x_{i+1}=x_i+d$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. In this problem, $$$n=3$$$.For example, the following sequences are AP: $$$[5, 10, 15]$$$, $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 1, 1]$$$, and $$$[13, 10, 7]$$$. The following sequences are not AP: $$$[1, 2, 4]$$$, $$$[0, 1, 0]$$$ and $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$.You need to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line contains the number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each of the following $$$t$$$ lines contains $$$3$$$ integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b, c \\\\le 10^8$$$).OutputFor each test case print\"YES\"(without quotes) if Polycarp can choose apositiveinteger $$$m$$$ and multiplyexactly oneof the integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ or $$$c$$$ by $$$m$$$ to make $$$[a, b, c]$$$ be an arithmetic progression. Print\"NO\"(without quotes) otherwise.You can printYESandNOin any (upper or lower) case (for example, the stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput1110 5 3030 5 101 2 31 6 32 6 31 1 11 1 21 1 31 100000000 12 1 11 2 2OutputYES YES YES YES NO YES NO YES YES NO YESNoteIn the first and second test cases, you can choose the number $$$m=4$$$ and multiply the second number ($$$b=5$$$) by $$$4$$$.In the first test case the resulting sequence will be $$$[10, 20, 30]$$$. This is an AP with a difference $$$d=10$$$.In the second test case the resulting sequence will be $$$[30, 20, 10]$$$. This is an AP with a difference $$$d=-10$$$.In the third test case, you can choose $$$m=1$$$ and multiply any number by $$$1$$$. The resulting sequence will be $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$. This is an AP with a difference $$$d=1$$$.In the fourth test case, you can choose $$$m=9$$$ and multiply the first number ($$$a=1$$$) by $$$9$$$. The resulting sequence will be $$$[9, 6, 3]$$$. This is an AP with a difference $$$d=-3$$$.In the fifth test case, it is impossible to make an AP.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "aed2d239", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given three positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$.
