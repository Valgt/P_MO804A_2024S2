Colorful Tree Againtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAn edge-weighted tree of $$$n$$$ nodes is given with each edge colored in some color. Each node of this tree can be blocked or unblocked, all nodes are unblocked initially.Asimple pathis a path in a graph that does not have repeating nodes. Thelengthof a path is defined as the sum of weights of all edges on the path.A path isgoodwhen it is asimple pathconsisting of edges of the same color $$$c$$$, all edges of color $$$c$$$ are on this path, and every node on the path is unblocked.You need to operate $$$2$$$ kinds of queries:block a node,unblock a node.After each query, print the maximumlengthamong allgoodpaths. If there are nogoodpaths, print $$$0$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n,q \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the number of nodes and the number of queries.Then $$$n-1$$$ lines follow, each containing four integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, $$$w$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq u,v,w,c \\\\leq n$$$; $$$u \\\\not = v$$$), denoting a weighted edge connecting node $$$u$$$ and node $$$v$$$ with weight $$$w$$$ and color $$$c$$$. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, each containing two integers $$$p$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$p = 0$$$ or $$$p = 1$$$, $$$1\\\\leq x\\\\leq n$$$), denoting a query:if $$$p = 0$$$, block the node $$$x$$$. It's guaranteed that it's not blocked at this time;if $$$p = 1$$$, unblock the node $$$x$$$. It's guaranteed that it's blocked at this time.OutputFor each query, print the maximum length of agoodpath.
