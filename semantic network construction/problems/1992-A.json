Only Plusestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKmes has written three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ in order to remember that he has to give Noobish_Monk $$$a \\\\times b \\\\times c$$$ bananas.Noobish_Monk has found these integers and decided to do the followingat most $$$5$$$ times:pick one of these integers;increase it by $$$1$$$.For example, if $$$a = 2$$$, $$$b = 3$$$ and $$$c = 4$$$, then one can increase $$$a$$$ three times by one and increase $$$b$$$ two times. After that $$$a = 5$$$, $$$b = 5$$$, $$$c = 4$$$. Then the total number of bananas will be $$$5 \\\\times 5 \\\\times 4 = 100$$$.What is the maximum value of $$$a \\\\times b \\\\times c$$$ Noobish_Monk can achieve with these operations?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b, c \\\\le 10$$$) — Kmes's integers.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum amount of bananas Noobish_Monk can get.ExampleInput22 3 410 1 10Output100 600", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2bb12da9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$.
