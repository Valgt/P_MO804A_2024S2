ZS Shuffles Cardstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputzscoderhas a deck of $$$n+m$$$ custom-made cards, which consists of $$$n$$$ cards labelled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ jokers. Sincezscoderis lonely, he wants to play a game with himself using those cards.Initially, the deck is shuffled uniformly randomly and placed on the table.zscoderhas a set $$$S$$$ which is initially empty.Every second,zscoderdraws the top card from the deck.If the card has a number $$$x$$$ written on it,zscoderremoves the card and adds $$$x$$$ to the set $$$S$$$.If the card drawn is a joker,zscoderplaces all the cards back into the deck and reshuffles (uniformly randomly) the $$$n+m$$$ cards to form a new deck (hence the new deck now contains all cards from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and the $$$m$$$ jokers). Then, if $$$S$$$ currently contains all the elements from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the game ends. Shuffling the deck doesn't take time at all.What is the expected number of seconds before the game ends?
