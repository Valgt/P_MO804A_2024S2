Very Interesting Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutIn a very ancient country the following game was popular. Two people play the game. Initially first player writes a strings1, consisting of exactly nine digits and representing a number that does not exceeda. After that second player looks ats1and writes a strings2, consisting of exactly nine digits and representing a number that does not exceedb. Hereaandbare some given constants,s1ands2are chosen by the players. The strings are allowed to contain leading zeroes.If a number obtained by the concatenation (joining together) of stringss1ands2is divisible bymod, then the second player wins. Otherwise the first player wins. You are given numbersa,b,mod. Your task is to determine who wins if both players play in the optimal manner. If the first player wins, you are also required to find the lexicographically minimum winning move.InputThe first line contains three integersa,b,mod(0 ≤a,b≤ 109,1 ≤mod≤ 107).OutputIf the first player wins, print \"1\" and the lexicographically minimum strings1he has to write to win. If the second player wins, print the single number \"2\".ExamplesInput1 10 7Output2Input4 0 9Output1 000000001NoteThe lexical comparison of strings is performed by the < operator in modern programming languages.

These strings always have length 9.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "20e2a5f5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Two players take turns writing 9-digit numbers. \n\n* Player 1 writes a number less than or equal to $a$.\n* Player 2 writes a number less than or equal to $b$.\n\nThe players then concatenate their numbers to form a new number.
