Build the Permutationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three integers $$$n, a, b$$$.

The description of test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\\\leq a,b \\\\leq n$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, if there is no permutation with the requested properties, output $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, print the permutation that you are found.
