Here $$$a=2$$$, $$$b=1$$$, $$$c=3$$$, and the height is $$$2$$$.$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$ Arooted treeis a connected graph without cycles, with a special vertex called theroot. In a rooted tree, among any two vertices connected by an edge, one vertex is a parent (the one closer to the root), and the other one is a child.Thedistancebetween two vertices in a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between them. Theheightof a rooted tree is the maximum distance from a vertex to the root.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a, b, c \\\\leq 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\leq a + b + c$$$).The sum of $$$a + b + c$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, if no such tree exists, output $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, output one integer — the minimum height of a tree satisfying the conditions in the statement.ExampleInput102 1 30 0 10 1 11 0 21 1 33 1 48 17 924 36 481 0 00 3 1Output2 0 1 1 -1 3 6 -1 -1 3NoteThe first test case is pictured in the statement.
