Unfortunately, the fruit on the tree get withered, so they can only be collected on dayaiand dayai+ 1(all fruits that are not collected in these two days, become unfit to eat).Valera is not very fast, but there are some positive points. Valera is ready to work every day. In one day, Valera can collect no more thanvfruits. The fruits may be either from the same tree, or from different ones. What is the maximum amount of fruit Valera can collect for all time, if he operates optimally well?InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandv(1 ≤n,v≤ 3000)— the number of fruit trees in the garden and the number of fruits that Valera can collect in a day.Nextnlines contain the description of trees in the garden.
