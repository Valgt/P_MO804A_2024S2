Since the Department of economic development of IT City creates realistic models only, that quadratic equation has a solution, moreover there are exactly two different real roots.The greater of these roots corresponds to the optimistic scenario, the smaller one corresponds to the pessimistic one. Help to get these estimates, first the optimistic, then the pessimistic one.InputThe only line of the input contains three integersa,b,c(- 1000 ≤a,b,c≤ 1000) — the coefficients ofax2+bx+c= 0equation.OutputIn the first line output the greater of the equation roots, in the second line output the smaller one. Absolute or relative error should not be greater than10- 6.ExamplesInput1 30 200Output-10.000000000000000-20.000000000000000", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "94a5f39b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where $-1000 \\le a, b, c \\le 1000$, find and output the two real roots of the equation.
