Minimal Costtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a graph of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$10^6 + 2$$$ columns, where rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and columns from $$$0$$$ to $$$10^6 + 1$$$:Let's denote the node in the row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ by $$$(i, j)$$$.Initially for each $$$i$$$ the $$$i$$$-th row has exactly one obstacle — at node $$$(i, a_i)$$$. You want to move some obstacles so that you can reach node $$$(n, 10^6+1)$$$ from node $$$(1, 0)$$$ by moving through edges of this graph (you can't pass through obstacles). Moving one obstacle to an adjacent by edge free node costs $$$u$$$ or $$$v$$$ coins, as below:If there is an obstacle in the node $$$(i, j)$$$, you can use $$$u$$$ coins to move it to $$$(i-1, j)$$$ or $$$(i+1, j)$$$, if such node exists and if there is no obstacle in that node currently.If there is an obstacle in the node $$$(i, j)$$$, you can use $$$v$$$ coins to move it to $$$(i, j-1)$$$ or $$$(i, j+1)$$$, if such node exists and if there is no obstacle in that node currently.Note that youcan't move obstacles outside the grid. For example, you can't move an obstacle from $$$(1,1)$$$ to $$$(0,1)$$$.Refer to the picture above for a better understanding.Now you need to calculate the minimal number of coins you need to spend to be able to reach node $$$(n, 10^6+1)$$$ from node $$$(1, 0)$$$ by moving through edges of this graph without passing through obstacles.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\\\le u, v \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the number of rows in the graph and the numbers of coins needed to move vertically and horizontally respectively.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$) — where $$$a_i$$$ represents that the obstacle in the $$$i$$$-th row is in node $$$(i, a_i)$$$.It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimal number of coins you need to spend to be able to reach node $$$(n, 10^6+1)$$$ from node $$$(1, 0)$$$ by moving through edges of this graph without passing through obstacles.It can be shown that under the constraints of the problem there is always a way to make such a trip possible.ExampleInput3 2 3 4 2 2 2 3 4 3 2 2 4 3 3 2Output7 3 3NoteIn the first sample, two obstacles are at $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(2,2)$$$.
