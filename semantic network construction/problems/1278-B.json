A and Btime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. You can perform a sequence of operations: during the first operation you choose one of these numbers and increase it by $$$1$$$; during the second operation you choose one of these numbers and increase it by $$$2$$$, and so on. You choose the number of these operations yourself.For example, if $$$a = 1$$$ and $$$b = 3$$$, you can perform the following sequence of three operations:add $$$1$$$ to $$$a$$$, then $$$a = 2$$$ and $$$b = 3$$$;add $$$2$$$ to $$$b$$$, then $$$a = 2$$$ and $$$b = 5$$$;add $$$3$$$ to $$$a$$$, then $$$a = 5$$$ and $$$b = 5$$$.Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case print one integer — the minimum numbers of operations required to make $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal.ExampleInput3 1 3 11 11 30 20Output3 0 4NoteFirst test case considered in the statement.In the second test case integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are already equal, so you don't need to perform any operations.In the third test case you have to apply the first, the second, the third and the fourth operation to $$$b$$$ ($$$b$$$ turns into $$$20 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 30$$$).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "bebee82c", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You have two numbers.
