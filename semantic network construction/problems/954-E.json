Thei-th water tap can be set to deliver any amount of water from0toaiml per second (this amount may be a real number). The water delivered byi-th tap has temperatureti.If for everyyou seti-th tap to deliver exactlyximl of water per second, then the resulting temperature of water will be(if, then to avoid division by zero we state that the resulting water temperature is0).You have to set all the water taps in such a way that the resulting temperature is exactlyT. What is the maximum amount of water you may get per second if its temperature has to beT?InputThe first line contains two integersnandT(1 ≤n≤ 200000,1 ≤T≤ 106) — the number of water taps and the desired temperature of water, respectively.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 106) whereaiis the maximum amount of wateri-th tap can deliver per second.The third line containsnintegerst1,t2, ...,tn(1 ≤ti≤ 106) — the temperature of water each tap delivers.OutputPrint the maximum possible amount of water with temperature exactlyTyou can get per second (if it is impossible to obtain water with such temperature, then the answer is considered to be0).Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed10- 6.ExamplesInput2 1003 1050 150Output6.000000000000000Input3 95 5 306 6 10Output40.000000000000000Input2 121 310 15Output1.666666666666667", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "df27002d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have $n$ water taps.
