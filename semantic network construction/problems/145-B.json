Lucky Number 2time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutPetya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits4and7. For example, numbers47,744,4are lucky and5,17,467are not.Petya loves long lucky numbers very much. He is interested in theminimumlucky numberdthat meets some condition. Letcnt(x)be the number of occurrences of numberxin numberdas a substring. For example, ifd= 747747, thencnt(4) = 2,cnt(7) = 4,cnt(47) = 2,cnt(74) = 2. Petya wants the following condition to fulfil simultaneously:cnt(4) =a1,cnt(7) =a2,cnt(47) =a3,cnt(74) =a4. Petya is not interested in the occurrences of other numbers. Help him cope with this task.InputThe single line contains four integersa1,a2,a3anda4(1 ≤a1,a2,a3,a4≤ 106).OutputOn the single line print without leading zeroes the answer to the problem — the minimum lucky numberdsuch, thatcnt(4) =a1,cnt(7) =a2,cnt(47) =a3,cnt(74) =a4.
