Array Paintingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer is either $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, or $$$2$$$. Initially, each element of the array is blue.Your goal is to paint each element of the array red. In order to do so, you can perform operations of two types:pay one coin to choose a blue element and paint it red;choose a red element which is not equal to $$$0$$$ and a blue elementadjacentto it, decrease the chosen red element by $$$1$$$, and paint the chosen blue element red.What is the minimum number of coins you have to spend to achieve your goal?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2$$$).OutputPrint one integer â€” the minimum number of coins you have to spend in order to paint all elements red.ExamplesInput3 0 2 0Output1Input4 0 0 1 1Output2Input7 0 1 0 0 1 0 2Output4NoteIn the first example, you can paint all elements red with having to spend only one coin as follows:paint the $$$2$$$-nd element red by spending one coin;decrease the $$$2$$$-nd element by $$$1$$$ and paint the $$$1$$$-st element red;decrease the $$$2$$$-nd element by $$$1$$$ and paint the $$$3$$$-rd element red.In the second example, you can paint all elements red spending only two coins as follows:paint the $$$4$$$-th element red by spending one coin;decrease the $$$4$$$-th element by $$$1$$$ and paint the $$$3$$$-rd element red;paint the $$$1$$$-st element red by spending one coin;decrease the $$$3$$$-rd element by $$$1$$$ and paint the $$$2$$$-nd element red.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1f082b3b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, where each integer is either 0, 1, or 2.
