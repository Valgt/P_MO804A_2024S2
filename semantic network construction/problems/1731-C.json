Even Subarraystime limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$).Find the number of subarrays of $$$a$$$ whose $$$\\\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ has an even number of divisors. In other words, find all pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$i \\\\le j$$$) such that $$$a_i \\\\oplus a_{i + 1} \\\\oplus \\\\dots \\\\oplus a_j$$$ has an even number of divisors.For example, numbers $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$5$$$ or $$$6$$$ have an even number of divisors, while $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ — odd. Consider that $$$0$$$ has an odd number of divisors in this task.Here $$$\\\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ (or $$$\\\\oplus$$$) denotes thebitwise XOR operation.Print the number of subarrays but multiplied by 2022...Okay, let's stop. Just print the actual answer.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the number of subarrays, whose $$$\\\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ has an even number of divisors.ExampleInput433 1 254 2 1 5 344 4 4 475 7 3 7 1 7 3Output4 11 0 20NoteIn the first test case, there are $$$4$$$ subarrays whose $$$\\\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ has an even number of divisors: $$$[3]$$$, $$$[3,1]$$$, $$$[1,2]$$$, $$$[2]$$$.In the second test case, there are $$$11$$$ subarrays whose $$$\\\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ has an even number of divisors: $$$[4,2]$$$, $$$[4,2,1]$$$, $$$[4,2,1,5]$$$, $$$[2]$$$, $$$[2,1]$$$, $$$[2,1,5]$$$, $$$[2,1,5,3]$$$, $$$[1,5,3]$$$, $$$[5]$$$, $$$[5,3]$$$, $$$[3]$$$.In the third test case, there is no subarray whose $$$\\\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ has an even number of divisors since $$$\\\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ of any subarray is either $$$4$$$ or $$$0$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0b001aac", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
