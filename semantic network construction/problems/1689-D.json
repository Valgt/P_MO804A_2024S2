Lena and Matrixtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLena is a beautiful girl who likes logical puzzles.As a gift for her birthday, Lena got a matrix puzzle!The matrix consists of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, and each cell is either black or white. The coordinates $$$(i,j)$$$ denote the cell which belongs to the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column for every $$$1\\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$ and $$$1\\\\leq j \\\\leq m$$$. To solve the puzzle, Lena has to choose a cell that minimizes the Manhattan distance to the farthest black cell from the chosen cell.More formally, let there be $$$k \\\\ge 1$$$ black cells in the matrix with coordinates $$$(x_i,y_i)$$$ for every $$$1\\\\leq i \\\\leq k$$$. Lena should choose a cell $$$(a,b)$$$ that minimizes $$$$$$\\\\max_{i=1}^{k}(|a-x_i|+|b-y_i|).$$$$$$As Lena has no skill, she asked you for help. Will you tell her the optimal cell to choose?InputThere are several test cases in the input data. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t\\\\leq 10\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the test cases description.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2\\\\leq n,m \\\\leq 1000$$$)  — the dimensions of the matrix.The following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ characters each, each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The $$$j$$$-th character in the $$$i$$$-th of these lines is 'W' if the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ is white, and 'B' if the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ is black.It is guaranteed that at least one black cell exists.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n\\\\cdot m$$$ does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the optimal cell $$$(a,b)$$$ to choose. If multiple answers exist, output any.ExampleInput5 3 2 BW WW WB 3 3 WWB WBW BWW 2 3 BBB BBB 5 5 BWBWB WBWBW BWBWB WBWBW BWBWB 9 9 WWWWWWWWW WWWWWWWWW BWWWWWWWW WWWWWWWWW WWWWBWWWW WWWWWWWWW WWWWWWWWW WWWWWWWWW WWWWWWWWBOutput2 1 2 2 1 2 3 3 6 5NoteIn the first test case the two black cells have coordinates $$$(1,1)$$$ and $$$(3,2)$$$. The four optimal cells are $$$(1,2)$$$, $$$(2,1)$$$, $$$(2,2)$$$ and $$$(3,1)$$$. It can be shown that no other cell minimizes the maximum Manhattan distance to every black cell.In the second test case it is optimal to choose the black cell $$$(2,2)$$$ with maximum Manhattan distance being $$$2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d5fd1f1a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a matrix of black and white cells.
