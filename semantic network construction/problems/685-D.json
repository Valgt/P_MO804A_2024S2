Kay and Eternitytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSnow Queen told Kay to form a word \"eternity\" using pieces of ice. Kay is eager to deal with the task, because he will then become free, and Snow Queen will give him all the world and a pair of skates.Behind the palace of the Snow Queen there is an infinite field consisting of cells. There arenpieces of ice spread over the field, each piece occupying exactly one cell and no two pieces occupying the same cell. To estimate the difficulty of the task Kay looks at some squares of sizek×kcells, with corners located at the corners of the cells and sides parallel to coordinate axis and counts the number of pieces of the ice inside them.This method gives an estimation of the difficulty of some part of the field. However, Kay also wants to estimate the total difficulty, so he came up with the following criteria: for eachx(1 ≤x≤n) he wants to count the number of squares of sizek×k, such that there are exactlyxpieces of the ice inside.Please, help Kay estimate the difficulty of the task given by the Snow Queen.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 100 000,1 ≤k≤ 300) — the number of pieces of the ice and the valuek, respectively. Each of the nextnlines contains two integersxiandyi(- 109≤xi,yi≤ 109) — coordinates of the cell containingi-th piece of the ice. It's guaranteed, that no two pieces of the ice occupy the same cell.OutputPrintnintegers: the number of squares of sizek×kcontaining exactly1, 2, ...,npieces of the ice.ExampleInput5 34 54 65 55 67 7Output10 8 1 4 0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "80d3eaa5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a 2D grid and a number of points on that grid.
