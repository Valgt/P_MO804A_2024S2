Restore Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWhile discussing a proper problem A for a Codeforces Round, Kostya created a cyclic array of positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$. Since the talk was long and not promising, Kostya created a new cyclic array $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_{n}$$$ so that $$$b_i = (a_i \\\\mod a_{i + 1})$$$, where we take $$$a_{n+1} = a_1$$$. Here $$$mod$$$ is themodulo operation. When the talk became interesting, Kostya completely forgot how array $$$a$$$ had looked like. Suddenly, he thought that restoring array $$$a$$$ from array $$$b$$$ would be an interesting problem (unfortunately, not A).InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 140582$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_{n}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 187126$$$).OutputIf it is possible to restore some array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ so that $$$b_i = a_i \\\\mod a_{(i \\\\mod n) + 1}$$$ holds for all $$$i = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, n$$$, print «YES» in the first line and the integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ in the second line. All $$$a_i$$$ should satisfy $$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^{18}$$$. We can show that if an answer exists, then an answer with such constraint exists as well.It it impossible to restore any valid $$$a$$$, print «NO» in one line.You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).ExamplesInput41 3 1 0OutputYES1 3 5 2Input24 4OutputNONoteIn the first example:$$$1 \\\\mod 3 = 1$$$$$$3 \\\\mod 5 = 3$$$$$$5 \\\\mod 2 = 1$$$$$$2 \\\\mod 1 = 0$$$", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "720fe47b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array $b$ of length $n$.
