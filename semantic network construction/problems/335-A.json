Bananatime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutPiegirl is buying stickers for a project. Stickers come on sheets, and each sheet of stickers contains exactlynstickers. Each sticker has exactly one character printed on it, so a sheet of stickers can be described by a string of lengthn. Piegirl wants to create a stringsusing stickers. She may buy as many sheets of stickers as she wants, and may specify any string of lengthnfor the sheets, but all the sheets must be identical, so the string is the same for all sheets. Once she attains the sheets of stickers, she will take some of the stickers from the sheets and arrange (in any order) them to forms. Determine the minimum number of sheets she has to buy, and provide a string describing a possible sheet of stickers she should buy.InputThe first line contains strings(1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000), consisting of lowercase English characters only. The second line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 1000).OutputOn the first line, print the minimum number of sheets Piegirl has to buy. On the second line, print a string consisting ofnlower case English characters. This string should describe a sheet of stickers that Piegirl can buy in order to minimize the number of sheets. If Piegirl cannot possibly form the strings, print instead a single line with the number -1.ExamplesInputbanana4Output2baanInputbanana3Output3nabInputbanana2Output-1NoteIn the second example, Piegirl can order 3 sheets of stickers with the characters \"nab\". She can take characters \"nab\" from the first sheet, \"na\" from the second, and \"a\" from the third, and arrange them to from \"banana\".", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1d5cf170", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string $s$ and an integer $n$.
