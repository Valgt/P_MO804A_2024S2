Two Round Dancestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutOne day, $$$n$$$ people ($$$n$$$ is an even number) met on a plaza and made two round dances, each round dance consists of exactly $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ people. Your task is to find the number of ways $$$n$$$ people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ people. Each person should belong to exactly one of these two round dances.Round dance is a dance circle consisting of $$$1$$$ or more people. Two round dances are indistinguishable (equal) if one can be transformed to another by choosing the first participant. For example, round dances $$$[1, 3, 4, 2]$$$, $$$[4, 2, 1, 3]$$$ and $$$[2, 1, 3, 4]$$$ are indistinguishable.For example, if $$$n=2$$$ then the number of ways is $$$1$$$: one round dance consists of the first person and the second one of the second person.For example, if $$$n=4$$$ then the number of ways is $$$3$$$. Possible options:one round dance — $$$[1,2]$$$, another — $$$[3,4]$$$;one round dance — $$$[2,4]$$$, another — $$$[3,1]$$$;one round dance — $$$[4,1]$$$, another — $$$[3,2]$$$.Your task is to find the number of ways $$$n$$$ people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ people.InputThe input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 20$$$), $$$n$$$ is an even number.OutputPrint one integer — the number of ways to make two round dances.
