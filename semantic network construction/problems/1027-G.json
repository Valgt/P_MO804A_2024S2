X-mouse in the Campustime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe campus has $$$m$$$ rooms numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$m - 1$$$. Also the $$$x$$$-mouse lives in the campus. The $$$x$$$-mouse is not just a mouse: each second $$$x$$$-mouse moves from room $$$i$$$ to the room $$$i \\\\cdot x \\\\mod{m}$$$ (in fact, it teleports from one room to another since it doesn't visit any intermediate room). Starting position of the $$$x$$$-mouse is unknown.You are responsible to catch the $$$x$$$-mouse in the campus, so you are guessing about minimum possible number of traps (one trap in one room) you need to place. You are sure that if the $$$x$$$-mouse enters a trapped room, it immediately gets caught.And the only observation you made is $$$\\\\text{GCD} (x, m) = 1$$$.InputThe only line contains two integers $$$m$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le m \\\\le 10^{14}$$$, $$$1 \\\\le x < m$$$, $$$\\\\text{GCD} (x, m) = 1$$$) — the number of rooms and the parameter of $$$x$$$-mouse.OutputPrint the only integer — minimum number of traps you need to install to catch the $$$x$$$-mouse.ExamplesInput4 3Output3Input5 2Output2NoteIn the first example you can, for example, put traps in rooms $$$0$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$. If the $$$x$$$-mouse starts in one of this rooms it will be caught immediately. If $$$x$$$-mouse starts in the $$$1$$$-st rooms then it will move to the room $$$3$$$, where it will be caught.In the second example you can put one trap in room $$$0$$$ and one trap in any other room since $$$x$$$-mouse will visit all rooms $$$1..m-1$$$ if it will start in any of these rooms.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "bd2204a3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $m$ rooms numbered from 0 to $m-1$.
