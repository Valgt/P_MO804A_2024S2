Longest Array Deconstructiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMr. Chanek gives you a sequence $$$a$$$ indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Define $$$f(a)$$$ as the number of indices where $$$a_i = i$$$.You can pick an element from the current sequence and remove it, then concatenate the remaining elements together. For example, if you remove the $$$3$$$-rd element from the sequence $$$[4, 2, 3, 1]$$$, the resulting sequence will be $$$[4, 2, 1]$$$.You want to remove some elements from $$$a$$$ in order to maximize $$$f(a)$$$, using zero or more operations. Find the largest possible $$$f(a)$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the initial length of the sequence.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the initial sequence $$$a$$$.OutputOutput an integer denoting the largest $$$f(a)$$$ that can be obtained by doing zero or more operations.ExamplesInput7 2 1 4 2 5 3 7Output3Input4 4 2 3 1Output2NoteIn the first example, $$$f(A) = 3$$$ by doing the following operations.$$$[2,1,\\\\textbf{4},2,5,3,7] \\\\rightarrow [\\\\textbf{2},1,2,5,3,7] \\\\rightarrow [1,2,5,3,\\\\textbf{7}] \\\\rightarrow [1,2,\\\\textbf{5},3] \\\\rightarrow [1,2,3]$$$In the second example, $$$f(A) = 2$$$ and no additional operation is needed.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1f0ed64f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.  \n\nDefine $f(a)$ as the number of indices $i$ where $a_i = i$.\n\nYou can remove one element from the sequence at a time and concatenate the remaining elements.
