Bear and Prime Numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutRecently, the bear started studying data structures and faced the following problem.You are given a sequence of integersx1,x2, ...,xnof lengthnandmqueries, each of them is characterized by two integersli,ri. Let's introducef(p)to represent the number of such indexesk, thatxkis divisible byp. The answer to the queryli,riis the sum:, whereS(li,ri)is a set of prime numbers from segment[li,ri](both borders are included in the segment).Help the bear cope with the problem.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 106). The second line containsnintegersx1,x2, ...,xn(2 ≤xi≤ 107). The numbers are not necessarily distinct.The third line contains integerm(1 ≤m≤ 50000). Each of the followingmlines contains a pair of space-separated integers,liandri(2 ≤li≤ri≤ 2·109)— the numbers that characterize the current query.OutputPrintmintegers — the answers to the queries on the order the queries appear in the input.ExamplesInput65 5 7 10 14 1532 113 124 4Output970Input72 3 5 7 11 4 828 102 123Output07NoteConsider the first sample.
