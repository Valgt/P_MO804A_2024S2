City Daytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor years, the Day of city N was held in the most rainy day of summer. New mayor decided to break this tradition and select anot-so-rainyday for the celebration. The mayor knows the weather forecast for the $$$n$$$ days of summer. On the $$$i$$$-th day, $$$a_i$$$ millimeters of rain will fall. All values $$$a_i$$$ are distinct.The mayor knows that citizens will watch the weather $$$x$$$ days before the celebration and $$$y$$$ days after. Because of that, he says that a day $$$d$$$ isnot-so-rainyif $$$a_d$$$ is smaller than rain amounts at each of $$$x$$$ days before day $$$d$$$ and and each of $$$y$$$ days after day $$$d$$$. In other words, $$$a_d < a_j$$$ should hold for all $$$d - x \\\\le j < d$$$ and $$$d < j \\\\le d + y$$$. Citizens only watch the weather during summer, so we only consider such $$$j$$$ that $$$1 \\\\le j \\\\le n$$$.Help mayor find theearliestnot-so-rainyday of summer.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$, $$$0 \\\\le x, y \\\\le 7$$$) — the number of days in summer, the number of days citizens watch the weather before the celebration and the number of days they do that after.The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ denotes the rain amount on the $$$i$$$-th day.OutputPrint a single integer — the index of the earliestnot-so-rainyday of summer. We can show that the answer always exists.ExamplesInput10 2 2 10 9 6 7 8 3 2 1 4 5Output3Input10 2 3 10 9 6 7 8 3 2 1 4 5Output8Input5 5 5 100000 10000 1000 100 10Output5NoteIn the first example days $$$3$$$ and $$$8$$$ arenot-so-rainy. The $$$3$$$-rd day is earlier.In the second example day $$$3$$$ is notnot-so-rainy, because $$$3 + y = 6$$$ and $$$a_3 > a_6$$$. Thus, day $$$8$$$ is the answer. Note that $$$8 + y = 11$$$, but we don't consider day $$$11$$$, because it is not summer.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "eecc93d5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, representing the amount of rain on each of $n$ days.
