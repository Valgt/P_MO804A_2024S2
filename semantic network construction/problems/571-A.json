Lengthening Stickstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three sticks with positive integer lengths ofa,b, andccentimeters. You can increase length of some of them by some positive integer number of centimeters (different sticks can be increased by a different length), but in total by at mostlcentimeters. In particular, it is allowed not to increase the length of any stick.Determine the number of ways to increase the lengths of some sticks so that you can form from them a non-degenerate (that is, having a positive area) triangle. Two ways are considered different, if the length of some stick is increased by different number of centimeters in them.InputThe single line contains4integersa,b,c,l(1 ≤a,b,c≤ 3·105,0 ≤l≤ 3·105).OutputPrint a single integer — the number of ways to increase the sizes of the sticks by the total of at mostlcentimeters, so that you can make a non-degenerate triangle from it.ExamplesInput1 1 1 2Output4Input1 2 3 1Output2Input10 2 1 7Output0NoteIn the first sample test you can either not increase any stick or increase any two sticks by1centimeter.In the second sample test you can increase either the first or the second stick by one centimeter.
