Mainak and Interesting Sequencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMainak has two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$.Mainak finds a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integersinteresting, iffor allintegers $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$), thebitwise XORof all elements in $$$a$$$ which arestrictly lessthan $$$a_i$$$ is $$$0$$$. Formally if $$$p_i$$$ is the bitwise XOR of all elements in $$$a$$$ which are strictly less than $$$a_i$$$, then $$$a$$$ is aninterestingsequence if $$$p_1 = p_2 = \\\\ldots = p_n = 0$$$.For example, sequences $$$[1,3,2,3,1,2,3]$$$, $$$[4,4,4,4]$$$, $$$[25]$$$ areinteresting, whereas $$$[1,2,3,4]$$$ ($$$p_2 = 1 \\\\ne 0$$$), $$$[4,1,1,2,4]$$$ ($$$p_1 = 1 \\\\oplus 1 \\\\oplus 2 = 2 \\\\ne 0$$$), $$$[29,30,30]$$$ ($$$p_2 = 29 \\\\ne 0$$$) aren't interesting.Here $$$a \\\\oplus b$$$ denotes bitwise XOR of integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.Find anyinterestingsequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ (or report that there exists no such sequence) such that the sum of the elements in the sequence $$$a$$$ is equal to $$$m$$$, i.e. $$$a_1 + a_2 \\\\ldots + a_n = m$$$.As a reminder, the bitwise XOR of an empty sequence is considered to be $$$0$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line and the only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the sequence and the sum of the elements.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, if there exists some interesting sequence, output \"Yes\" on the first line, otherwise output \"No\". You may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as positive answer).If the answer is \"Yes\", output $$$n$$$positive integers$$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i \\\\ge 1$$$), forming aninterestingsequence such that $$$a_1 + a_2 \\\\ldots + a_n = m$$$.
