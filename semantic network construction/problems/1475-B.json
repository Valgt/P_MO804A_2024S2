New Year's Numbertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp remembered the $$$2020$$$-th year, and he is happy with the arrival of the new $$$2021$$$-th year. To remember such a wonderful moment, Polycarp wants to represent the number $$$n$$$ as the sum of a certain number of $$$2020$$$ and a certain number of $$$2021$$$.For example, if:$$$n=4041$$$, then the number $$$n$$$ can be represented as the sum $$$2020 + 2021$$$;$$$n=4042$$$, then the number $$$n$$$ can be represented as the sum $$$2021 + 2021$$$;$$$n=8081$$$, then the number $$$n$$$ can be represented as the sum $$$2020 + 2020 + 2020 + 2021$$$;$$$n=8079$$$, then the number $$$n$$$ cannot be represented as the sum of the numbers $$$2020$$$ and $$$2021$$$.Help Polycarp to find out whether the number $$$n$$$ can be represented as the sum of a certain number of numbers $$$2020$$$ and a certain number of numbers $$$2021$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^6$$$) — the number that Polycarp wants to represent as the sum of the numbers $$$2020$$$ and $$$2021$$$.OutputFor each test case, output on a separate line:\"YES\" if the number $$$n$$$ is representable as the sum of a certain number of $$$2020$$$ and a certain number of $$$2021$$$;\"NO\" otherwise.You can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill be recognized as positive).ExampleInput5 1 4041 4042 8081 8079OutputNO YES YES YES NO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "340389f9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a positive integer $n$, determine if it can be expressed as the sum of some number of 2020 and some number of 2021. \n\nFor example:\n\n* $n = 4041$ can be expressed as $2020 + 2021$\n* $n = 8081$ can be expressed as $2020 + 2020 + 2020 + 2021$\n* $n = 8079$ cannot be expressed as a sum of 2020 and 2021. \n\n\nYou will be given multiple values of $n$ to test.
