Timofey and remodulingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLittle Timofey likes integers a lot. Unfortunately, he is very young and can't work with very big integers, so he does all the operations modulo his favorite primem. Also, Timofey likes to look for arithmetical progressions everywhere.One of his birthday presents was a sequence ofdistinctintegersa1,a2, ...,an. Timofey wants to know whether he can rearrange the elements of the sequence so that is will be an arithmetical progression modulom, or not.Arithmetical progression modulomof lengthnwith first elementxand differencedis sequence of integersx,x+d,x+ 2d, ...,x+ (n- 1)·d, each taken modulom.InputThe first line contains two integersmandn(2 ≤m≤ 109+ 7,1 ≤n≤ 105,mis prime) — Timofey's favorite prime module and the length of the sequence.The second line containsndistinctintegersa1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai<m) — the elements of the sequence.OutputPrint-1if it is not possible to rearrange the elements of the sequence so that is will be an arithmetical progression modulom.Otherwise, print two integers — the first element of the obtained progressionx(0 ≤x<m) and its differenced(0 ≤d<m).If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput17 50 2 4 13 15Output13 2Input17 50 2 4 13 14Output-1Input5 31 2 3Output3 4", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1a494984", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a prime number $m$ and a sequence of $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, determine if it is possible to rearrange the elements of the sequence to form an arithmetic progression modulo $m$. \n\nIf it is possible, output the first element $x$ and the common difference $d$ of the arithmetic progression.
