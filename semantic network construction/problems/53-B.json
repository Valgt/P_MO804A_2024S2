Blog Phototime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutOne popular blog site edits the uploaded photos like this. It cuts a rectangular area out of them so that the ratio of height to width (i.e. theheight/widthquotient) can vary from 0.8 to 1.25 inclusively. Besides, at least one side of the cut area should have a size, equal to some power of number 2 (2xfor some integerx). If those rules don't indicate the size of the cut are clearly, then the way with which the cut part possesses the largest area is chosen. Of course, both sides of the cut area should be integer. If there are several answers to this problem, you should choose the answer with the maximal height.InputThe first line contains a pair of integershandw(1 ≤h,w≤ 109) which are the height and width of the uploaded photo in pixels.OutputPrint two integers which are the height and width of the cut area.ExamplesInput2 1Output1 1Input2 2Output2 2Input5 5Output5 4", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "727ed347", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given the height ($h$) and width ($w$) of a photo.
