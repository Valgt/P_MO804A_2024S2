Optical Experimenttime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutProfessor Phunsuk Wangdu has performed some experiments on rays. The setup fornrays is as follows.There is a rectangular box having exactlynholes on the opposite faces. All rays enter from the holes of the first side and exit from the holes of the other side of the box. Exactly one ray can enter or exit from each hole. The holes are in a straight line.Professor Wangdu is showing his experiment to his students. He shows that there are cases, when all the rays are intersected by every other ray. A curious student asked the professor: \"Sir, there are some groups of rays such that all rays in that group intersect every other ray in that group. Can we determine the number of rays in the largest of such groups?\".Professor Wangdu now is in trouble and knowing your intellect he asks you to help him.InputThe first line containsn(1 ≤n≤ 106), the number of rays. The second line containsndistinct integers. Thei-th integerxi(1 ≤xi≤n) shows that thexi-th ray enters from thei-th hole. Similarly, third line containsndistinct integers. Thei-th integeryi(1 ≤yi≤n) shows that theyi-th ray exits from thei-th hole. All rays are numbered from1ton.OutputOutput contains the only integer which is the number of rays in the largest group of rays all of which intersect each other.ExamplesInput51 4 5 2 33 4 2 1 5Output3Input33 1 22 3 1Output2NoteFor the first test case, the figure is shown above. The output of the first test case is 3, since the rays number 1, 4 and 3 are the ones which are intersected by each other one i.e. 1 is intersected by 4 and 3, 3 is intersected by 4 and 1, and 4 is intersected by 1 and 3. Hence every ray in this group is intersected by each other one. There does not exist any group containing more than 3 rays satisfying the above-mentioned constraint.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "53ddadb4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two lists of integers, one representing the entry points of $n$ rays into a box and the other representing their exit points.  \n\nDetermine the size of the largest group of rays where every ray in the group intersects every other ray in the group. \n\n**Input:**\n\n* The first line contains an integer $n$ (1 ≤ $n$ ≤ 10⁶), the number of rays.\n* The second line contains $n$ distinct integers $x_i$ (1 ≤ $x_i$ ≤ $n$), representing the entry points of the rays.\n* The third line contains $n$ distinct integers $y_i$ (1 ≤ $y_i$ ≤ $n$), representing the exit points of the rays.\n\n**Output:**\n\n* Output a single integer, the size of the largest group of intersecting rays."}, {"prompt_md5": "99ebe9ff", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers representing rays entering and exiting holes in a box.
