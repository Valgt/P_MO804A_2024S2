Payment Without Changetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have $$$a$$$ coins of value $$$n$$$ and $$$b$$$ coins of value $$$1$$$. You always pay in exact change, so you want to know if there exist such $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ that if you take $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le x \\\\le a$$$) coins of value $$$n$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le y \\\\le b$$$) coins of value $$$1$$$, then the total value of taken coins will be $$$S$$$.You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$q$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains four integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$n$$$ and $$$S$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b, n, S \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the number of coins of value $$$n$$$, the number of coins of value $$$1$$$, the value $$$n$$$ and the required total value.OutputFor the $$$i$$$-th test case print the answer on it —YES(without quotes) if there exist such $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ that if you take $$$x$$$ coins of value $$$n$$$ and $$$y$$$ coins of value $$$1$$$, then the total value of taken coins will be $$$S$$$, andNOotherwise.You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill all be recognized as positive answer).ExampleInput4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 6 5 2 6 27 3 3 5 18OutputYES NO NO YES", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ba674ac3", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You have two types of coins: some coins worth 'n' and some worth 1.
