Konrad and Company Evaluationtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKonrad is a Human Relations consultant working for VoltModder, a large electrical equipment producer. Today, he has been tasked with evaluating the level of happiness in the company.There are $$$n$$$ people working for VoltModder, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each employee earns a different amount of money in the company — initially, the $$$i$$$-th person earns $$$i$$$ rubles per day.On each of $$$q$$$ following days, the salaries will be revised. At the end of the $$$i$$$-th day, employee $$$v_i$$$ will start earning $$$n+i$$$ rubles per day and will become the best-paid person in the company. The employee will keep his new salary until it gets revised again.Some pairs of people don't like each other. This creates a great psychological danger in the company. Formally, if two people $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ dislike each other and $$$a$$$ earns more money than $$$b$$$, employee $$$a$$$ will brag about this to $$$b$$$. Adangerous tripleis a triple of three employees $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$, such that $$$a$$$ brags to $$$b$$$, who in turn brags to $$$c$$$. If $$$a$$$ dislikes $$$b$$$, then $$$b$$$ dislikes $$$a$$$.At the beginning of each day, Konrad needs to evaluate the number ofdangerous triplesin the company. Can you help him do it?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$, $$$0 \\\\le m \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$) — the number of employees in the company and the number of pairs of people who don't like each other. Each of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i, b_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$a_i \\\\neq b_i$$$) denoting that employees $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ hate each other (that is, $$$a_i$$$ dislikes $$$b_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ dislikes $$$a_i$$$). Each such relationship will be mentioned exactly once.The next line contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le q \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$) — the number of salary revisions. The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v_i \\\\le n$$$) denoting that at the end of the $$$i$$$-th day, employee $$$v_i$$$ will earn the most.OutputOutput $$$q + 1$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th of them should contain the number ofdangerous triplesin the company at the beginning of the $$$i$$$-th day.ExamplesInput4 5 1 2 2 4 1 3 3 4 2 3 2 2 3Output4 3 2Input3 3 1 2 2 3 1 3 5 1 2 2 1 3Output1 1 1 1 1 1NoteConsider the first sample test. The $$$i$$$-th row in the following image shows the structure of the company at the beginning of the $$$i$$$-th day. A directed edge from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ denotes that employee $$$a$$$ brags to employee $$$b$$$. The dangerous triples are marked by highlighted edges.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "44d22bfd", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ employees, numbered from 1 to $n$.
