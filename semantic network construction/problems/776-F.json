Sherlock's bet to Moriartytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSherlock met Moriarty for a final battle of wits. He gave him a regularnsided convex polygon. In addition to it, he gave him certain diagonals to form regions on the polygon. It was guaranteed that the diagonals did not intersect in interior points.He took each of the region and calculated its importance value. Importance value for a region formed by verticesa1,a2, ... ,axof the polygon will be given by2a1+ 2a2+ ... + 2ax. Then, he sorted these regions on the basis of their importance value in ascending order. After that he assigned each region an index from1tok, wherekis the number of regions, and index of region is its position in the sorted array calculated above.He wants Moriarty to color the regions using not more than20colors, such that two regions have same color only if all the simple paths between these two regions have at least one region with color value less than the color value assigned to these regions.

Help Sherlock in doing so.InputFirst line contains two integersnandm(3 ≤n≤ 100000,0 ≤m≤n- 3), the number of vertices in the polygon and the number of diagonals added.Each of the nextmlines contains two integersaandb(1 ≤a,b≤n), describing a diagonal between verticesaandb. It is guaranteed that the diagonals are correct, i. e.aandbdon't coincide and are not neighboring. It is guaranteed that the diagonals do not intersect.OutputLet the number of regions bek.Outputkspace-separated integers, each between1and20, representing the colors of the regions in the order of increasing importance.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
