Array Decrementstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKristina has two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, each containing $$$n$$$ non-negative integers. She can perform the following operation on array $$$a$$$ any number of times:apply a decrement to each non-zero element of the array, that is, replace the value of each element $$$a_i$$$ such that $$$a_i > 0$$$ with the value $$$a_i - 1$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$). If $$$a_i$$$ was $$$0$$$, its value does not change.Determine whether Kristina can get an array $$$b$$$ from an array $$$a$$$ in some number of operations (probably zero). In other words, can she make $$$a_i = b_i$$$ after some number of operations for each $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$?For example, let $$$n = 4$$$, $$$a = [3, 5, 4, 1]$$$ and $$$b = [1, 3, 2, 0]$$$. In this case, she can apply the operation twice:after the first application of the operation she gets $$$a = [2, 4, 3, 0]$$$;after the second use of the operation she gets $$$a = [1, 3, 2, 0]$$$.Thus, in two operations, she can get an array $$$b$$$ from an array $$$a$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) —the number of test cases in the test.The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$).The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).The third line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ values over all test cases in the test does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output on a separate line:YES, if by doing some number of operations it is possible to get an array $$$b$$$ from an array $$$a$$$;NOotherwise.You can outputYESandNOin any case (for example, stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput643 5 4 11 3 2 031 2 10 1 045 3 7 21 1 1 151 2 3 4 51 2 3 4 6180146OutputYES YES NO NO YES NONoteThe first test case is analyzed in the statement.In the second test case, it is enough to apply the operation to array $$$a$$$ once.In the third test case, it is impossible to get array $$$b$$$ from array $$$a$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e0d9cfc6", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two arrays,  $a$ and $b$, both of length $n$.
