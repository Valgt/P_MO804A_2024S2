Help him to choose the bus stop, where he should get off. If such bus stops are multiple, choose the bus stop closest to the University.InputThe first line contains three integer numbers:2 ≤n≤ 100,1 ≤vb,vs≤ 1000. The second line containsnnon-negative integers in ascending order: coordinatesxiof the bus stop with indexi. It is guaranteed thatx1equals to zero, andxn≤ 105. The third line contains the coordinates of the University, integersxuandyu, not exceeding105in absolute value.OutputIn the only line output the answer to the problem — index of the optimum bus stop.ExamplesInput4 5 20 2 4 64 1Output3Input2 1 10 100000100000 100000Output2NoteAs you know, students are a special sort of people, and minibuses usually do not hurry.
