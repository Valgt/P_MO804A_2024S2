Scuzatime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTimur has a stairway with $$$n$$$ steps. The $$$i$$$-th step is $$$a_i$$$ meters higher than its predecessor. The first step is $$$a_1$$$ meters higher than the ground, and the ground starts at $$$0$$$ meters.The stairs for the first test case.Timur has $$$q$$$ questions, each denoted by an integer $$$k_1, \\\\dots, k_q$$$. For each question $$$k_i$$$, you have to print the maximum possible height Timur can achieve by climbing the steps if his legs are of length $$$k_i$$$. Timur can only climb the $$$j$$$-th step if his legs are of length at least $$$a_j$$$. In other words, $$$k_i \\\\geq a_j$$$ for each step $$$j$$$ climbed.Note that you should answer each question independently.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, q \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of steps and the number of questions, respectively.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the height of the steps.The third line of each test case contains $$$q$$$ integers ($$$0 \\\\leq k_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers for each question.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$q$$$ does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing $$$q$$$ integers, the answer for each question.Please note, that the answer for some questions won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (likelong longfor C++).ExampleInput34 51 2 1 51 2 4 9 102 21 10 13 11000000000 1000000000 10000000001000000000Output1 4 4 9 9  0 2  3000000000NoteConsider the first test case, pictured in the statement.If Timur's legs have length $$$1$$$, then he can only climb stair $$$1$$$, so the highest he can reach is $$$1$$$ meter.If Timur's legs have length $$$2$$$ or $$$4$$$, then he can only climb stairs $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$, so the highest he can reach is $$$1+2+1=4$$$ meters.If Timur's legs have length $$$9$$$ or $$$10$$$, then he can climb the whole staircase, so the highest he can reach is $$$1+2+1+5=9$$$ meters.In the first question of the second test case, Timur has no legs, so he cannot go up even a single step.:(", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c93e8cbe", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a staircase with $n$ steps.
