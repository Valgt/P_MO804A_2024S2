Radio Stationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAs the guys fried the radio station facilities, the school principal gave them tasks as a punishment. Dustin's task was to add comments to nginx configuration for school's website. The school hasnservers. Each server has a name and an ip (names aren't necessarily unique, but ips are). Dustin knows the ip and name of each server. For simplicity, we'll assume that an nginx command is of form \"command ip;\" wherecommandis a string consisting of English lowercase letter only, andipis the ip of one of school servers.Each ip is of form \"a.b.c.d\" wherea,b,canddare non-negative integers less than or equal to255(with no leading zeros). The nginx configuration file Dustin has to add comments to hasmcommands. Nobody ever memorizes the ips of servers, so to understand the configuration better, Dustin has to comment the name of server that the ip belongs to at the end of each line (after each command). More formally, if a line is \"command ip;\" Dustin has to replace it with \"command ip; #name\" wherenameis the name of the server with ip equal toip.Dustin doesn't know anything about nginx, so he panicked again and his friends asked you to do his task for him.InputThe first line of input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 1000).The nextnlines contain the names and ips of the servers. Each line contains a stringname, name of the server and a stringip, ip of the server, separated by space (1 ≤ |name| ≤ 10,nameonly consists of English lowercase letters). It is guaranteed that all ip are distinct.The nextmlines contain the commands in the configuration file. Each line is of form \"command ip;\" (1 ≤ |command| ≤ 10,commandonly consists of English lowercase letters). It is guaranteed that ip belongs to one of thenschool servers.OutputPrintmlines, the commands in the configuration file after Dustin did his task.ExamplesInput2 2main 192.168.0.2replica 192.168.0.1block 192.168.0.1;proxy 192.168.0.2;Outputblock 192.168.0.1; #replicaproxy 192.168.0.2; #mainInput3 5google 8.8.8.8codeforces 212.193.33.27server 138.197.64.57redirect 138.197.64.57;block 8.8.8.8;cf 212.193.33.27;unblock 8.8.8.8;check 138.197.64.57;Outputredirect 138.197.64.57; #serverblock 8.8.8.8; #googlecf 212.193.33.27; #codeforcesunblock 8.8.8.8; #googlecheck 138.197.64.57; #server", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e184349a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of servers, each with a name and an IP address.
