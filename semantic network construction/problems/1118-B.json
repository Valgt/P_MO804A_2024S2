Tanya and Candiestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTanya has $$$n$$$ candies numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th candy has the weight $$$a_i$$$.She plans to eat exactly $$$n-1$$$ candies and give the remaining candy to her dad. Tanya eats candies in order of increasing their numbers,exactly one candy per day.Your task is to find the number of such candies $$$i$$$ (let's call these candiesgood) that if dad gets the $$$i$$$-th candy then the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in even days will be equal to the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in odd days. Note that at first, she will give the candy, after it she will eat the remaining candies one by one.For example, $$$n=4$$$ and weights are $$$[1, 4, 3, 3]$$$. Consider all possible cases to give a candy to dad:Tanya gives the $$$1$$$-st candy to dad ($$$a_1=1$$$), the remaining candies are $$$[4, 3, 3]$$$. She will eat $$$a_2=4$$$ in the first day, $$$a_3=3$$$ in the second day, $$$a_4=3$$$ in the third day. So in odd days she will eat $$$4+3=7$$$ and in even days she will eat $$$3$$$. Since $$$7 \\\\ne 3$$$ this case shouldn't be counted to the answer (this candy isn'tgood).Tanya gives the $$$2$$$-nd candy to dad ($$$a_2=4$$$), the remaining candies are $$$[1, 3, 3]$$$. She will eat $$$a_1=1$$$ in the first day, $$$a_3=3$$$ in the second day, $$$a_4=3$$$ in the third day. So in odd days she will eat $$$1+3=4$$$ and in even days she will eat $$$3$$$. Since $$$4 \\\\ne 3$$$ this case shouldn't be counted to the answer (this candy isn'tgood).Tanya gives the $$$3$$$-rd candy to dad ($$$a_3=3$$$), the remaining candies are $$$[1, 4, 3]$$$. She will eat $$$a_1=1$$$ in the first day, $$$a_2=4$$$ in the second day, $$$a_4=3$$$ in the third day. So in odd days she will eat $$$1+3=4$$$ and in even days she will eat $$$4$$$. Since $$$4 = 4$$$ this caseshould be countedto the answer (this candy isgood).Tanya gives the $$$4$$$-th candy to dad ($$$a_4=3$$$), the remaining candies are $$$[1, 4, 3]$$$. She will eat $$$a_1=1$$$ in the first day, $$$a_2=4$$$ in the second day, $$$a_3=3$$$ in the third day. So in odd days she will eat $$$1+3=4$$$ and in even days she will eat $$$4$$$. Since $$$4 = 4$$$ this caseshould be countedto the answer (this candy isgood).In total there $$$2$$$ cases which should counted (these candies aregood), so the answer is $$$2$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of candies.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^4$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the weight of the $$$i$$$-th candy.OutputPrint one integer — the number of such candies $$$i$$$ (goodcandies) that if dad gets the $$$i$$$-th candy then the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in even days will be equal to the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in odd days.ExamplesInput7 5 5 4 5 5 5 6Output2Input8 4 8 8 7 8 4 4 5Output2Input9 2 3 4 2 2 3 2 2 4Output3NoteIn the first example indices ofgoodcandies are $$$[1, 2]$$$.In the second example indices ofgoodcandies are $$$[2, 3]$$$.In the third example indices ofgoodcandies are $$$[4, 5, 9]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "12b16d2c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, representing the weights of $n$ candies.  \n\nYou need to find the number of candies, such that if you remove that candy and eat the rest in order, the sum of the weights of the candies eaten on even days equals the sum of the weights of the candies eaten on odd days."}, {"prompt_md5": "722814c6", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers.
