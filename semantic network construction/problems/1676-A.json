Lucky?time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA ticket is a string consisting of six digits. A ticket is considered lucky if the sum of the first three digits is equal to the sum of the last three digits. Given a ticket, output if it is lucky or not. Note that a ticket can have leading zeroes.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of testcases.The description of each test consists of one line containing one string consisting of six digits.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case.
