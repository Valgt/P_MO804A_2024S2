She has now decided to post some fake news on the HC2Facebook page. However, she wants to be able to communicate to the HC2committee that the post is fake, using some secret phrase hidden in the post as a subsequence. To make this method foolproof, she wants the phrase to appearntimes in the post.

Each string should be composed of letters (a-zandA-Z: both lowercase and uppercase are allowed) and have length at most200. The number of occurrences ofpinsas a subsequence should be exactlyn.
