Cycle Palindrometime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWe say that a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ is a palindrome if for all $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$, $$$a_i = a_{n-i+1}$$$. You are given a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ and you have to find, if it exists, acycle permutation$$$\\\\sigma$$$ so that the sequence $$$a_{\\\\sigma(1)}, a_{\\\\sigma(2)}, \\\\ldots, a_{\\\\sigma(n)}$$$ is a palindrome.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, n$$$ is a bijective function from $$$\\\\{1, 2, \\\\ldots, n\\\\}$$$ to $$$\\\\{1, 2, \\\\ldots, n\\\\}$$$. We say that a permutation $$$\\\\sigma$$$ is a cycle permutation if $$$1, \\\\sigma(1), \\\\sigma^2(1), \\\\ldots, \\\\sigma^{n-1}(1)$$$ are pairwise different numbers. Here $$$\\\\sigma^m(1)$$$ denotes $$$\\\\underbrace{\\\\sigma(\\\\sigma(\\\\ldots \\\\sigma}_{m \\\\text{ times}}(1) \\\\ldots))$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 3 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the sequence.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq n$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases is at most $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one line withYESif a cycle permutation exists, otherwise output one line withNO.If the answer isYES, output one additional line with $$$n$$$ integers $$$\\\\sigma(1), \\\\sigma(2), \\\\ldots, \\\\sigma(n)$$$, the permutation. If there is more than one permutation, you may print any.ExampleInput3 4 1 2 2 1 3 1 2 1 7 1 3 3 3 1 2 2OutputYES 3 1 4 2  NO YES 5 3 7 2 6 4 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0a731a3a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ integers.
