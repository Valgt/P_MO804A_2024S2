Candy Box (easy version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis problem is actually a subproblem of problem G from the same contest.There are $$$n$$$ candies in a candy box. The type of the $$$i$$$-th candy is $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$).You have to prepare a gift using some of these candies with the following restriction: the numbers of candies of each type presented in a gift should be all distinct (i. e. for example, a gift having two candies of type $$$1$$$ and two candies of type $$$2$$$ is bad).It is possible that multiple types of candies are completely absent from the gift. It is also possible thatnot all candiesof some types will be taken to a gift.Your task is to find out themaximumpossible size of the single gift you can prepare using the candies you have.You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries. Each query is represented by two lines.The first line of each query contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of candies.The second line of each query contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the type of the $$$i$$$-th candy in the box.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all queries does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each query print one integer — themaximumpossible size of the single gift you can compose using candies you got in this query with the restriction described in the problem statement.ExampleInput3 8 1 4 8 4 5 6 3 8 16 2 1 3 3 4 3 4 4 1 3 2 2 2 4 1 1 9 2 2 4 4 4 7 7 7 7Output3 10 9NoteIn the first query, you can prepare a gift with two candies of type $$$8$$$ and one candy of type $$$5$$$, totalling to $$$3$$$ candies.Note that this is not the only possible solution — taking two candies of type $$$4$$$ and one candy of type $$$6$$$ is also valid.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a4250617", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a box of $n$ candies, where each candy has a type from 1 to $n$.
