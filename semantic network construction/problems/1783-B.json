You have to find a matrix of size $$$n \\\\times n$$$, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n^2$$$ occurs exactly once, such that itsbeautyis the maximum possible among all such matrices.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 49$$$) – the number of test cases.The first (and only) line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$).OutputFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ rows of $$$n$$$ integers — a matrix of integers of size $$$n \\\\times n$$$, where each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n^2$$$ occurs exactly once, such that its beauty is the maximum possible among all such matrices.
