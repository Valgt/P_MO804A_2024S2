The layout of your beatmap consists of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$4$$$ columns. Because notes at the bottom are closer, you will process the bottommost row first and the topmost row last. Each row will contain exactly one note, represented as a '#'.For each note $$$1, 2, \\\\dots, n$$$, in the order of processing, output the column in which the note appears.InputThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.For each test case, the first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 500$$$) — the number of rows of the beatmap.The following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$4$$$ characters. The $$$i$$$-th line represents the $$$i$$$-th row of the beatmap from the top. It is guaranteed that the characters are either '.' or '#', and exactly one of the characters is '#'.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers on a new line, the column that the $$$i$$$-th note appears in for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.ExampleInput34#....#....#....#2.#...#..1...#Output4 3 2 1  2 2  4", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7f0ad462", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a grid of $n$ rows and 4 columns.
