IQ Testtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutIn the city of Ultima Thule job applicants are often offered an IQ test.The test is as follows: the person gets a piece of squared paper with a4 × 4square painted on it. Some of the square's cells are painted black and others are painted white. Your task is to repaintat most onecell the other color so that the picture has a2 × 2square, completely consisting of cells of the same color. If the initial picture already has such a square, the person should just say so and the test will be completed.Your task is to write a program that determines whether it is possible to pass the test. You cannot pass the test if either repainting any cell or no action doesn't result in a2 × 2square, consisting of cells of the same color.InputFour lines contain four characters each: thej-th character of thei-th line equals \".\" if the cell in thei-th row and thej-th column of the square is painted white, and \"#\", if the cell is black.OutputPrint \"YES\" (without the quotes), if the test can be passed and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.ExamplesInput####.#..####....OutputYESInput####....####....OutputNONoteIn the first test sample it is enough to repaint the first cell in the second row.
