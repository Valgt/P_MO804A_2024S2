Madoka and Math Dadtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMadoka finally found the administrator password for her computer. Her father is a well-known popularizer of mathematics, so the password is the answer to the following problem.Find the maximum decimal number without zeroes and with no equal digits in a row, such that the sum of its digits is $$$n$$$.Madoka is too tired of math to solve it herself, so help her to solve this problem!InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$) — the required sum of the digits.OutputFor each test case print the maximum number you can obtain.ExampleInput512345Output1 2 21 121 212NoteThe only numbers with the sum of digits equal to $$$2$$$ without zeros are $$$2$$$ and $$$11$$$. But the last one has two ones in a row, so it's not valid. That's why the answer is $$$2$$$.The only numbers with the sum of digits equal to $$$3$$$ without zeros are $$$111$$$, $$$12$$$, $$$21$$$, and $$$3$$$. The first one has $$$2$$$ ones in a row, so it's not valid. So the maximum valid number is $$$21$$$.The only numbers with the sum of digits equals to $$$4$$$ without zeros are $$$1111$$$, $$$211$$$, $$$121$$$, $$$112$$$, $$$13$$$, $$$31$$$, $$$22$$$, and $$$4$$$. Numbers $$$1111$$$, $$$211$$$, $$$112$$$, $$$22$$$ aren't valid, because they have some identical digits in a row. So the maximum valid number is $$$121$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6ceae82c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an integer $n$, find the largest number less than or equal to $1000$ that meets the following conditions:\n\n*  The number does not contain any zero digits.\n*  No digit in the number is repeated consecutively.\n*  The sum of the digits of the number is equal to $n$. \n\n\n\nOutput the largest number that satisfies these conditions."}, {"prompt_md5": "3fdc2d3d", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Find the largest number without any zero digits and no repeating digits in a row, where the sum of the digits equals a given number."}]}
