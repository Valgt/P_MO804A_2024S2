Count Votingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ people that will participate in voting. Each person has exactly one vote.$$$i$$$-th person has a team $$$t_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t_i \\\\leq n$$$) where $$$t_i = t_j$$$ means $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ are in the same team. By the rules each person should vote for the person from the different team. Note that it automatically means that each person can't vote for himself.Each person knows the number of votes $$$c_i$$$ he wants to get. How many possible votings exists, such that each person will get the desired number of votes? Due to this number can be big, find it by modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 200$$$) — the number of people.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq c_i \\\\leq n$$$) — desired number of votes.
