Valera and Numbertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutValera is a coder. Recently he wrote a funny program. The pseudo code for this program is given below://input: integers x, k, pa = x;for(step = 1; step <= k; step = step + 1){rnd = [random integer from 1 to 100];if(rnd <= p)a = a * 2;elsea = a + 1;}s = 0;while(remainder after dividing a by 2 equals 0){a = a / 2;s = s + 1;}Now Valera wonders: given the valuesx,kandp, what is the expected value of the resulting numbers?InputThe first line of the input contains three integersx,k,p(1 ≤x≤ 109; 1 ≤k≤ 200; 0 ≤p≤ 100).OutputPrint the required expected value. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed10- 6.ExamplesInput1 1 50Output1.0000000000000Input5 3 0Output3.0000000000000Input5 3 25Output1.9218750000000NoteIf the concept of expected value is new to you, you can read about it by the link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "56f77a5e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given three integers $x$, $k$, and $p$, calculate the expected value of the following process:\n\n1.
