You are standing at cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ and your goal is to finish at cell $$$(n, m)$$$.You can move to the neighboring cells to the right or down. In other words, suppose you are standing at cell $$$(x, y)$$$. You can:move right to the cell $$$(x, y + 1)$$$ — it costs $$$x$$$ burles;move down to the cell $$$(x + 1, y)$$$ — it costs $$$y$$$ burles.Can you reach cell $$$(n, m)$$$ spendingexactly$$$k$$$ burles?InputThe first line contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 100$$$; $$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the sizes of grid and the exact amount of money you need to spend.OutputFor each test case, if you can reach cell $$$(n, m)$$$ spendingexactly$$$k$$$ burles, printYES.
