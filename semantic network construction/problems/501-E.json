Misha and Palindrome Degreetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutMisha has an array ofnintegers indexed by integers from1ton. Let's definepalindrome degreeof arrayaas the number of such index pairs(l,r)(1 ≤l≤r≤n), that the elements from thel-th to ther-th one inclusive can be rearranged in such a way that thewholearray will be a palindrome. In other words, pair(l,r)should meet the condition that after some rearranging of numbers on positions fromltor, inclusive (it is allowed not to rearrange the numbers at all), for any1 ≤i≤nfollowing condition holds:a[i] =a[n-i+ 1].Your task is to find thepalindrome degreeof Misha's array.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105).The second line containsnpositive integersa[i](1 ≤a[i] ≤n), separated by spaces — the elements of Misha's array.OutputIn a single line print the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput32 2 2Output6Input63 6 5 3 3 5Output0Input55 5 2 5 2Output4NoteIn the first sample test any possible pair(l,r)meets the condition.In the third sample test following pairs(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)meet the condition.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4bcefa91", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.  \n\nFind the number of pairs of indices $(l, r)$ where $1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$ such that you can rearrange the elements of the array from index $l$ to $r$ (inclusive) to make the entire array a palindrome.  \n\nA palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward."}, {"prompt_md5": "ef49be37", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given an array of numbers, find the number of pairs of indices (l, r) such that the numbers between those indices (inclusive) can be rearranged to form a palindrome."}]}
