Tree Shufflingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAshish has a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ nodes numbered $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ rooted at node $$$1$$$. The $$$i$$$-th node in the tree has a cost $$$a_i$$$, and binary digit $$$b_i$$$ is written in it. He wants to have binary digit $$$c_i$$$ written in the $$$i$$$-th node in the end.To achieve this, he can perform the following operation any number of times:Select any $$$k$$$ nodes from the subtree of any node $$$u$$$, and shuffle the digits in these nodes as he wishes, incurring a cost of $$$k \\\\cdot a_u$$$. Here, he can choose $$$k$$$ ranging from $$$1$$$ to the size of the subtree of $$$u$$$.He wants to perform the operations in such a way that every node finally has the digit corresponding to its target.Help him find the minimum total cost he needs to spend so that after all the operations, every node $$$u$$$ has digit $$$c_u$$$ written in it, or determine that it is impossible.InputFirst line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5)$$$ denoting the number of nodes in the tree.$$$i$$$-th line of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains 3 space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, $$$c_i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9, 0 \\\\leq b_i, c_i \\\\leq 1)$$$  — the cost of the $$$i$$$-th node, its initial digit and its goal digit.Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contain two integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq u, v \\\\leq n, \\\\text{ } u \\\\ne v)$$$, meaning that there is an edge between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in the tree.OutputPrint the minimum total cost to make every node reach its target digit, and $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.ExamplesInput5 1 0 1 20 1 0 300 0 1 4000 0 0 50000 1 0 1 2 2 3 2 4 1 5Output4Input5 10000 0 1 2000 1 0 300 0 1 40 0 0 1 1 0 1 2 2 3 2 4 1 5Output24000Input2 109 0 1 205 0 1 1 2Output-1NoteThe tree corresponding to samples $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ are:In sample $$$1$$$, we can choose node $$$1$$$ and $$$k = 4$$$ for a cost of $$$4 \\\\cdot 1$$$ = $$$4$$$ and select nodes $$${1, 2, 3, 5}$$$, shuffle their digits and get the desired digits in every node.In sample $$$2$$$, we can choose node $$$1$$$ and $$$k = 2$$$ for a cost of $$$10000 \\\\cdot 2$$$, select nodes $$${1, 5}$$$ and exchange their digits, and similarly, choose node $$$2$$$ and $$$k = 2$$$ for a cost of $$$2000 \\\\cdot 2$$$, select nodes $$${2, 3}$$$ and exchange their digits to get the desired digits in every node.In sample $$$3$$$, it is impossible to get the desired digits, because there is no node with digit $$$1$$$ initially.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "08d390e3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ nodes, numbered from 1 to $n$.
