Instant Noodlestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWu got hungry after an intense training session, and came to a nearby store to buy his favourite instant noodles. After Wu paid for his purchase, the cashier gave him an interesting task.You are given a bipartite graph with positive integers in all vertices of therighthalf. For a subset $$$S$$$ of vertices of thelefthalf we define $$$N(S)$$$ as the set of all vertices of the right half adjacent to at least one vertex in $$$S$$$, and $$$f(S)$$$ as the sum of all numbers in vertices of $$$N(S)$$$. Find the greatest common divisor of $$$f(S)$$$ for all possible non-empty subsets $$$S$$$ (assume that GCD of empty set is $$$0$$$).Wu is too tired after his training to solve this problem. Help him!InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 500\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases in the given test set. Test case descriptions follow.The first line of each case description contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1~\\\\leq~n,~m~\\\\leq~500\\\\,000$$$) — the number of vertices in either half of the graph, and the number of edges respectively.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq c_i \\\\leq 10^{12}$$$). The $$$i$$$-th number describes the integer in the vertex $$$i$$$ of the right half of the graph.Each of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains a pair of integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq u_i, v_i \\\\leq n$$$), describing an edge between the vertex $$$u_i$$$ of the left half and the vertex $$$v_i$$$ of the right half. It is guaranteed that the graph does not contain multiple edges.Test case descriptions are separated with empty lines. The total value of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$500\\\\,000$$$, and the total value of $$$m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$500\\\\,000$$$ as well.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the required greatest common divisor.ExampleInput3 2 4 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2  3 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3  4 7 36 31 96 29 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 2 2 4 3 1 4 3Output2 1 12NoteThe greatest common divisor of a set of integers is the largest integer $$$g$$$ such that all elements of the set are divisible by $$$g$$$.In the first sample case vertices of the left half and vertices of the right half are pairwise connected, and $$$f(S)$$$ for any non-empty subset is $$$2$$$, thus the greatest common divisor of these values if also equal to $$$2$$$.In the second sample case the subset $$$\\\\{1\\\\}$$$ in the left half is connected to vertices $$$\\\\{1, 2\\\\}$$$ of the right half, with the sum of numbers equal to $$$2$$$, and the subset $$$\\\\{1, 2\\\\}$$$ in the left half is connected to vertices $$$\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}$$$ of the right half, with the sum of numbers equal to $$$3$$$. Thus, $$$f(\\\\{1\\\\}) = 2$$$, $$$f(\\\\{1, 2\\\\}) = 3$$$, which means that the greatest common divisor of all values of $$$f(S)$$$ is $$$1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "fbc02320", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a bipartite graph.
