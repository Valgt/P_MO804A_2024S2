All letters in string $$$s$$$ are uppercase.Asubsequenceof string $$$s$$$ is a string that can be derived from $$$s$$$ by deleting some of its symbols without changing the order of the remaining symbols.

Subsequence \"CAB\" also has the same frequency of these letters, but doesn't have the maximum possible length.In the second example, none of the subsequences can have 'D', hence the answer is $$$0$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4efe88f7", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of the first $k$ letters of the alphabet (A to Z).  \n\nA subsequence of $s$ is a string that can be made by deleting some characters from $s$ without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n\nFind the length of the longest subsequence of $s$ where each of the first $k$ letters of the alphabet appears the same number of times."}, {"prompt_md5": "5730d095", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a string of uppercase letters.
