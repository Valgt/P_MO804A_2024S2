Four Segmentstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test64 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutSeveral months later Alex finally got his brother Bob's creation by post. And now, in his turn, Alex wants to boast about something to his brother. He thought for a while, and came to the conclusion that he has no ready creations, and decided to write a program for rectangles detection. According to his plan, the program detects if the four given segments form a rectangle of a positive area and with sides parallel to coordinate axes. As Alex does badly at school and can't write this program by himself, he asks you to help him.InputThe input data contain four lines. Each of these lines contains four integersx1,y1,x2,y2(- 109≤x1,y1,x2,y2≤ 109) — coordinates of segment's beginning and end positions. The given segments can degenerate into points.OutputOutput the word «YES», if the given four segments form the required rectangle, otherwise output «NO».ExamplesInput1 1 6 11 0 6 06 0 6 11 1 1 0OutputYESInput0 0 0 32 0 0 02 2 2 00 2 2 2OutputNO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ab267d6c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given four line segments, determine if they form a rectangle with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes. \n\nThe input consists of four lines, each containing four integers representing the x and y coordinates of the start and end points of each segment. \n\nOutput \"YES\" if the segments form a rectangle, otherwise output \"NO\"."}, {"prompt_md5": "5f7cce0f", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Determine if four line segments form a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes and a positive area."}]}
