Neko Rules the Catniverse (Small Version)time limit per test7 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis problem is same as the next one, but has smaller constraints.Aki is playing a new video game. In the video game, he will control Neko, the giant cat, to fly between planets in the Catniverse.There are $$$n$$$ planets in the Catniverse, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. At the beginning of the game, Aki chooses the planet where Neko is initially located. Then Aki performs $$$k - 1$$$ moves, where in each move Neko is moved from the current planet $$$x$$$ to some other planet $$$y$$$ such that:Planet $$$y$$$ is not visited yet.$$$1 \\\\leq y \\\\leq x + m$$$ (where $$$m$$$ is a fixed constant given in the input)This way, Neko will visit exactly $$$k$$$ different planets. Two ways of visiting planets are called different if there is some index $$$i$$$ such that the $$$i$$$-th planet visited in the first way is different from the $$$i$$$-th planet visited in the second way.What is the total number of ways to visit $$$k$$$ planets this way? Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.InputThe only line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le \\\\min(n, 12)$$$, $$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 4$$$) — the number of planets in the Catniverse, the number of planets Neko needs to visit and the said constant $$$m$$$.OutputPrint exactly one integer — the number of different ways Neko can visit exactly $$$k$$$ planets.
