Petya and Divisorstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLittle Petya loves looking for numbers' divisors. One day Petya came across the following problem:You are givennqueries in the form \"xiyi\". For each query Petya should count how many divisors of numberxidivide none of the numbersxi-yi,xi-yi+ 1, ...,xi- 1. Help him.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 105). Each of the followingnlines contain two space-separated integersxiandyi(1 ≤xi≤ 105,0 ≤yi≤i- 1, whereiis the query's ordinal number; the numeration starts with1).Ifyi= 0for the query, then the answer to the query will be the number of divisors of the numberxi. In this case you do not need to take the previous numbersxinto consideration.OutputFor each query print the answer on a single line: the number of positive integersksuch thatExamplesInput64 03 15 26 218 410000 3Output3112222NoteLet's write out the divisors that give answers for the first 5 queries:1) 1, 2, 42) 33) 54) 2, 65) 9, 18", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "30b3129a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ queries in the form $x_i y_i$.
