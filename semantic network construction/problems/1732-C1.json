Sheikh (Easy version)time limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$q = 1$$$.You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$.The cost of a subsegment of the array $$$[l, r]$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq n$$$, is the value $$$f(l, r) = \\\\operatorname{sum}(l, r) - \\\\operatorname{xor}(l, r)$$$, where $$$\\\\operatorname{sum}(l, r) = a_l + a_{l+1} + \\\\ldots + a_r$$$, and $$$\\\\operatorname{xor}(l, r) = a_l \\\\oplus a_{l+1} \\\\oplus \\\\ldots \\\\oplus a_r$$$ ($$$\\\\oplus$$$ stands forbitwise XOR).You will have $$$q = 1$$$ query. Each query is given by a pair of numbers $$$L_i$$$, $$$R_i$$$, where $$$1 \\\\leq L_i \\\\leq R_i \\\\leq n$$$. You need to find the subsegment $$$[l, r]$$$, $$$L_i \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq R_i$$$, with maximum value $$$f(l, r)$$$. If there are several answers, then among them you need to find a subsegment with the minimum length, that is, the minimum value of $$$r - l + 1$$$.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$, $$$q = 1$$$) — the length of the array and the number of queries.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — array elements.$$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines of each test case contains two integers $$$L_i$$$ and $$$R_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq L_i \\\\leq R_i \\\\leq n$$$) — the boundaries in which we need to find the segment.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.It is guaranteed that $$$L_1 = 1$$$ and $$$R_1 = n$$$.OutputFor each test case print $$$q$$$ pairs of numbers $$$L_i \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq R_i$$$ such that the value $$$f(l, r)$$$ is maximum and among such the length $$$r - l + 1$$$ is minimum. If there are several correct answers, print any of them.ExampleInput61 101 12 15 101 23 10 2 41 34 10 12 8 31 45 121 32 32 32 101 57 10 1 0 1 0 1 01 7Output1 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 2 3 2 4NoteIn the first test case, $$$f(1, 1) = 0 - 0 = 0$$$.In the second test case, $$$f(1, 1) = 5 - 5 = 0$$$, $$$f(2, 2) = 10 - 10 = 0$$$. Note that $$$f(1, 2) = (10 + 5) - (10 \\\\oplus 5) = 0$$$, but we need to find a subsegment with the minimum length among the maximum values of $$$f(l, r)$$$. So, only segments $$$[1, 1]$$$ and $$$[2, 2]$$$ are the correct answers.In the fourth test case, $$$f(2, 3) = (12 + 8) - (12 \\\\oplus 8) = 16$$$.There are two correct answers in the fifth test case, since $$$f(2, 3) = f(3, 4)$$$ and their lengths are equal.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "139d203a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
