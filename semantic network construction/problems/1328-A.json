Divisibility Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. In one move you can increase $$$a$$$ by $$$1$$$ (replace $$$a$$$ with $$$a+1$$$). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make $$$a$$$ divisible by $$$b$$$. It is possible, that you have to make $$$0$$$ moves, as $$$a$$$ is already divisible by $$$b$$$. You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case print the answer — the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make $$$a$$$ divisible by $$$b$$$.ExampleInput5 10 4 13 9 100 13 123 456 92 46Output2 5 4 333 0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5c2c2bd4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two positive integers $a$ and $b$.
