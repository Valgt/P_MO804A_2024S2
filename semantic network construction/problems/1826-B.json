Lunatic Never Contenttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers. Let's define $$$f(a, x) = [a_1 \\\\bmod x, a_2 \\\\bmod x, \\\\dots, a_n \\\\bmod x]$$$ for some positive integer $$$x$$$. Find the biggest $$$x$$$, such that $$$f(a, x)$$$ is a palindrome.Here, $$$a \\\\bmod x$$$ is the remainder of the integer division of $$$a$$$ by $$$x$$$.An array is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. More formally, an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is a palindrome if for every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$) $$$a_i = a_{n - i + 1}$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$).It's guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case output the biggest $$$x$$$, such that $$$f(a, x)$$$ is a palindrome.
