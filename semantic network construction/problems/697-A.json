Pineapple Incidenttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTed has a pineapple. This pineapple is able to bark like a bulldog! At timet(in seconds) it barks for the first time. Then everysseconds after it, it barks twice with1second interval. Thus it barks at timest,t+s,t+s+ 1,t+ 2s,t+ 2s+ 1, etc.Barney woke up in the morning and wants to eat the pineapple, but he can't eat it when it's barking. Barney plans to eat it at timex(in seconds), so he asked you to tell him if it's gonna bark at that time.InputThe first and only line of input contains three integerst,sandx(0 ≤t,x≤ 109,2 ≤s≤ 109) — the time the pineapple barks for the first time, the pineapple barking interval, and the time Barney wants to eat the pineapple respectively.OutputPrint a single \"YES\" (without quotes) if the pineapple will bark at timexor a single \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise in the only line of output.ExamplesInput3 10 4OutputNOInput3 10 3OutputYESInput3 8 51OutputYESInput3 8 52OutputYESNoteIn the first and the second sample cases pineapple will bark at moments3,13,14, ..., so it won't bark at the moment4and will bark at the moment3.In the third and fourth sample cases pineapple will bark at moments3,11,12,19,20,27,28,35,36,43,44,51,52,59, ..., so it will bark at both moments51and52.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "19fca551", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given three integers $t$, $s$, and $x$ (where $0 \\le t, x \\le 10^9$ and $2 \\le s \\le 10^9$), determine if an object will make a sound at time $x$. \n\nThe object makes a sound for the first time at time $t$.
