Chamo and Mocha's Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers as a gift.Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step operation some (possibly, zero) times:Choose indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq l < r \\\\leq n$$$)Let $$$x$$$ be the median$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ of the subarray $$$[a_l, a_{l+1},\\\\ldots, a_r]$$$Set all values $$$a_l, a_{l+1},\\\\ldots, a_r$$$ to $$$x$$$Suppose $$$a=[1,2,3,4,5]$$$ initially:If Mocha chooses $$$(l,r)=(3,4)$$$ in the first operation, then $$$x=3$$$, the array will be changed into $$$a=[1,2,3,3,5]$$$.If Mocha chooses $$$(l,r)=(1,3)$$$ in the first operation, then $$$x=2$$$, the array will be changed into $$$a=[2,2,2,4,5]$$$.Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ The median in an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ is an element that occupies position number $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{m+1}{2} \\\\rfloor$$$ after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example, the median of $$$[3,1,4,1,5]$$$ is $$$3$$$ and the median of $$$[5,25,20,24]$$$ is $$$20$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t\\\\leq 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\\\leq n\\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the maximum value of the number.ExampleInput221 251 2 3 4 5Output1 4NoteIn the first test case, $$$a=[1,2]$$$. Mocha can only choose the interval $$$(l,r)=(1,2)$$$. The array will be changed to $$$a=[1,1]$$$. Therefore, the answer is $$$1$$$.In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:Choose the interval $$$(l,r)=(4,5)$$$, then $$$a=[1,2,3,4,4]$$$.Choose the interval $$$(l,r)=(3,5)$$$, then $$$a=[1,2,4,4,4]$$$.Choose the interval $$$(l,r)=(1,5)$$$, then $$$a=[4,4,4,4,4]$$$.The array contains only the same number, which is $$$4$$$. It can be proven that the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than $$$4$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8753c906", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of positive integers.
