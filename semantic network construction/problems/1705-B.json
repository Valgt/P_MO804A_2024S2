Mark the Dust Sweepertime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMark is cleaning a row of $$$n$$$ rooms. The $$$i$$$-th room has a nonnegative dust level $$$a_i$$$. He has a magical cleaning machine that can do the following three-step operation.Select two indices $$$i<j$$$ such that the dust levels $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_{i+1}$$$, $$$\\\\dots$$$, $$$a_{j-1}$$$ are all strictly greater than $$$0$$$.Set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$a_i-1$$$.Set $$$a_j$$$ to $$$a_j+1$$$.Mark's goal is to make $$$a_1 = a_2 = \\\\ldots = a_{n-1} = 0$$$ so that he can nicely sweep the $$$n$$$-th room. Determine the minimum number of operations needed to reach his goal.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t\\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\\\leq n\\\\leq 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of rooms.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$0\\\\leq a_i\\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the dust level of each room.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a line containing a single integer — the minimum number of operations. It can be proven that there is a sequence of operations that meets the goal.ExampleInput432 0 050 2 0 2 062 0 3 0 4 640 0 0 10Output3 5 11 0NoteIn the first case, one possible sequence of operations is as follows.Choose $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=2$$$, yielding the array $$$[1,1,0]$$$.Choose $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=3$$$, yielding the array $$$[0,1,1]$$$.Choose $$$i=2$$$ and $$$j=3$$$, yielding the array $$$[0,0,2]$$$.At this point, $$$a_1=a_2=0$$$, completing the process.In the second case, one possible sequence of operations is as follows.Choose $$$i=4$$$ and $$$j=5$$$, yielding the array $$$[0,2,0,1,1]$$$.Choose $$$i=2$$$ and $$$j=3$$$, yielding the array $$$[0,1,1,1,1]$$$.Choose $$$i=2$$$ and $$$j=5$$$, yielding the array $$$[0,0,1,1,2]$$$.Choose $$$i=3$$$ and $$$j=5$$$, yielding the array $$$[0,0,0,1,3]$$$.Choose $$$i=4$$$ and $$$j=5$$$, yielding the array $$$[0,0,0,0,4]$$$.In the last case, the array already satisfies the condition.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0b852459", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ non-negative integers, representing the dust level of each room.
