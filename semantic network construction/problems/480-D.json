Parcelstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutJaroslav owns a small courier service. He has recently got and introduced a new system of processing parcels. Each parcel is a box, the box has its weight and strength. The system works as follows. It originally has an empty platform where you can put boxes by the following rules:If the platform is empty, then the box is put directly on the platform, otherwise it is put on the topmost box on the platform.The total weight of all boxes on the platform cannot exceed the strength of platformSat any time.The strength of any box of the platform at any time must be no less than the total weight of the boxes that stand above.You can take only the topmost box from the platform.The system receivesnparcels, thei-th parcel arrives exactly at timeini, its weight and strength are equal towiandsi, respectively. Each parcel has a value ofvibourles. However, to obtain this value, the system needs to give the parcel exactly at timeouti, otherwise Jaroslav will get 0 bourles for it. Thus, Jaroslav can skip any parcel and not put on the platform, formally deliver it at timeiniand not get anything for it.Any operation in the problem is performed instantly. This means that it is possible to make several operations of receiving and delivering parcels at the same time and in any order.Please note that the parcel that is delivered at timeouti, immediately gets outside of the system, and the following activities taking place at the same time are made ​​without taking it into consideration.Since the system is very complex, and there are a lot of received parcels, Jaroslav asks you to say what maximum amount of money he can get using his system.InputThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integersnandS(1 ≤n≤ 500,0 ≤S≤ 1000). Thennlines follow, thei-th line contains five space-separated integers:ini,outi,wi,siandvi(0 ≤ini<outi< 2n,0 ≤wi,si≤ 1000,1 ≤vi≤ 106). It is guaranteed that for anyiandj(i≠j) eitherini≠inj, orouti≠outj.OutputPrint a single number — the maximum sum in bourles that Jaroslav can get.ExamplesInput3 20 1 1 1 11 2 1 1 10 2 1 1 1Output3Input5 50 6 1 2 11 2 1 1 11 3 1 1 13 6 2 1 24 5 1 1 1Output5NoteNote to the second sample(Tis the moment in time):T= 0: The first parcel arrives, we put in on the first platform.T= 1: The second and third parcels arrive, we put the third one on the current top (i.e. first) parcel on the platform, then we put the secod one on the third one. Now the first parcel holds weightw2+w3= 2and the third parcel holdsw2= 1.T= 2: We deliver the second parcel and getv2= 1bourle. Now the first parcel holds weightw3= 1, the third one holds 0.T= 3: The fourth parcel comes. First we give the third parcel and getv3= 1bourle. Now the first parcel holds weight 0. We put the fourth parcel on it — the first one holdsw4= 2.T= 4: The fifth parcel comes. We cannot put it on the top parcel of the platform as in that case the first parcel will carry weightw4+w5= 3, that exceed its strengths1= 2, that's unacceptable. We skip the fifth parcel and get nothing for it.T= 5: Nothing happens.T= 6: We deliver the fourth, then the first parcel and getv1+v4= 3bourles for them.Note that you could have skipped the fourth parcel and got the fifth one instead, but in this case the final sum would be 4 bourles.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "51bbf7e1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ parcels, each arriving at time $t_i$ and departing at time $o_i$.
