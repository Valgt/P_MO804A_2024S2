Special Permutationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array $$$p=[p_1,p_2,\\\\dots,p_n]$$$, which contains every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (inclusive) and, moreover, each number appears exactly once. For example, $$$p=[3,1,4,2,5]$$$ is a permutation of length $$$5$$$.For a given number $$$n$$$ ($$$n \\\\ge 2$$$), find a permutation $$$p$$$ in which absolute difference (that is, the absolute value of difference) of any two neighboring (adjacent) elements is between $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$, inclusive. Formally, find such permutation $$$p$$$ that $$$2 \\\\le |p_i - p_{i+1}| \\\\le 4$$$ for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i < n$$$).Print any such permutation for the given integer $$$n$$$ or determine that it does not exist.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases in the input. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case is described by a single line containing an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$).OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines. Print a permutation that meets the given requirements. If there are several such permutations, then print any of them. If no such permutation exists, print-1.ExampleInput6 10 2 4 6 7 13Output9 6 10 8 4 7 3 1 5 2  -1 3 1 4 2  5 3 6 2 4 1  5 1 3 6 2 4 7  13 9 7 11 8 4 1 3 5 2 6 10 12", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "651cf1aa", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number, find a list of numbers from 1 to that number where the difference between any two consecutive numbers is between 2 and 4.
