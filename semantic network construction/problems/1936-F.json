Grand Finale: Circlestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given $$$n$$$ circles on the plane. The $$$i$$$-th of these circles is given by a tuple of integers $$$(x_i, y_i, r_i)$$$, where $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ are the coordinates of its center, and $$$r_i$$$ is the radius of the circle.Please find a circle $$$C$$$ which meets the following conditions:$$$C$$$ is contained inside all $$$n$$$ circles given in the input.Among all circles $$$C$$$ that meet the first condition, the radius of the circle is maximum.Let the largest suitable circle have the radius of $$$a$$$.Your output $$$C$$$, described as $$$(x,y,r)$$$, will be accepted if it meets the following conditions:For each $$$i$$$, $$$\\\\sqrt{(x_i-x)^2+(y_i-y)^2}+ r \\\\le r_i+\\\\max(a,1)\\\\cdot 10^{-7}$$$.The absolute or relative error of $$$r$$$ does not exceed $$$10^{-7}$$$.
