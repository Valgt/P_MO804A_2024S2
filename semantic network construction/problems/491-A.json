They have an entry in a travel journal specifying how many days did they travel up the hill, and how many days did they walk down the hill.Help them by suggesting some possible stop heights satisfying numbers from the travel journal.InputIn the first line there is an integer non-negative numberAdenoting the number of days of climbing up the hill.
