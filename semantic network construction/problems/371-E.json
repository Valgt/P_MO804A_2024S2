Subway Innovationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutBerland is going through tough times — the dirt price has dropped and that is a blow to the country's economy. Everybody knows that Berland is the top world dirt exporter!The President of Berland was forced to leave onlykof the currently existingnsubway stations.The subway stations are located on a straight line one after another, the trains consecutively visit the stations as they move. You can assume that the stations are on theOxaxis, thei-th station is at point with coordinatexi. In such case the distance between stationsiandjis calculated by a simple formula|xi-xj|.Currently, the Ministry of Transport is choosing which stations to close and which ones to leave. Obviously, the residents of the capital won't be too enthusiastic about the innovation, so it was decided to show the best side to the people. The Ministry of Transport wants to choose suchkstations that minimize the average commute time in the subway!Assuming that the train speed is constant (it is a fixed value), the average commute time in the subway is calculated as the sum of pairwise distances between stations, divided by the number of pairs (that is) and divided by the speed of the train.Help the Minister of Transport to solve this difficult problem. Write a program that, given the location of the stations selects suchkstations that the average commute time in the subway is minimized.InputThe first line of the input contains integern(3 ≤n≤ 3·105) — the number of the stations before the innovation. The second line contains the coordinates of the stationsx1,x2, ...,xn(- 108≤xi≤ 108). The third line contains integerk(2 ≤k≤n- 1) — the number of stations after the innovation.The station coordinates are distinct and not necessarily sorted.OutputPrint a sequence ofkdistinct integerst1,t2, ...,tk(1 ≤tj≤n) — the numbers of the stations that should be left after the innovation in arbitrary order. Assume that the stations are numbered 1 throughnin the order they are given in the input. The number of stations you print must have the minimum possible average commute time among all possible ways to choosekstations. If there are multiple such ways, you are allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput31 100 1012Output2 3NoteIn the sample testcase the optimal answer is to destroy the first station (withx= 1). The average commute time will be equal to 1 in this way.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "856bb63d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ points on a line, representing subway stations.
