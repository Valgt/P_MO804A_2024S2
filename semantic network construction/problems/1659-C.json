Line Empiretime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are an ambitious king who wants to be the Emperor of The Reals. But to do that, you must first become Emperor of The Integers.Consider a number axis. The capital of your empire is initially at $$$0$$$. There are $$$n$$$ unconquered kingdoms at positions $$$0<x_1<x_2<\\\\ldots<x_n$$$. You want to conquer all other kingdoms.There are two actions available to you:You can change the location of your capital (let its current position be $$$c_1$$$) to any otherconqueredkingdom (let its position be $$$c_2$$$) at a cost of $$$a\\\\cdot |c_1-c_2|$$$.From the current capital (let its current position be $$$c_1$$$) you can conquer an unconquered kingdom (let its position be $$$c_2$$$) at a cost of $$$b\\\\cdot |c_1-c_2|$$$. Youcannotconquer a kingdom if there is an unconquered kingdom between the target and your capital.Note that youcannotplace the capital at a point without a kingdom. In other words, at any point, your capital can only be at $$$0$$$ or one of $$$x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n$$$. Also note that conquering a kingdom does not change the position of your capital.Find the minimum total cost to conquer all kingdoms. Your capital can be anywhere at the end.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$)  — the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.The first line of each test case contains $$$3$$$ integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\leq a,b \\\\leq 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x_1 < x_2 < \\\\ldots < x_n \\\\leq 10^8$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer  — the minimum cost to conquer all kingdoms.ExampleInput45 2 73 5 12 13 215 6 31 5 6 21 302 9 310 1511 27182 3141516 18 33 98 874 989 4848 20458 34365 38117 72030Output173 171 75 3298918744NoteHere is an optimal sequence of moves for the second test case:Conquer the kingdom at position $$$1$$$ with cost $$$3\\\\cdot(1-0)=3$$$.Move the capital to the kingdom at position $$$1$$$ with cost $$$6\\\\cdot(1-0)=6$$$.Conquer the kingdom at position $$$5$$$ with cost $$$3\\\\cdot(5-1)=12$$$.Move the capital to the kingdom at position $$$5$$$ with cost $$$6\\\\cdot(5-1)=24$$$.Conquer the kingdom at position $$$6$$$ with cost $$$3\\\\cdot(6-5)=3$$$.Conquer the kingdom at position $$$21$$$ with cost $$$3\\\\cdot(21-5)=48$$$.Conquer the kingdom at position $$$30$$$ with cost $$$3\\\\cdot(30-5)=75$$$.The total cost is $$$3+6+12+24+3+48+75=171$$$.
