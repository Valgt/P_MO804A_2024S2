Analyzing Polylinetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutAs Valeric and Valerko were watching one of the last Euro Championship games in a sports bar, they broke a mug. Of course, the guys paid for it but the barman said that he will let them watch football in his bar only if they help his son complete a programming task. The task goes like that.Let's consider a set of functions of the following form:Let's define a sum ofnfunctionsy1(x), ...,yn(x)of the given type as functions(x) =y1(x) + ... +yn(x)for anyx. It's easy to show that in this case the graphs(x)is a polyline. You are givennfunctions of the given type, your task is to find the number of angles that do not equal 180 degrees, in the graphs(x), that is the sum of the given functions.Valeric and Valerko really want to watch the next Euro Championship game, so they asked you to help them.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105)— the number of functions. Each of the followingnlines contains two space-separated integer numberski,bi( - 109≤ki,bi≤ 109)that determine thei-th function.OutputPrint a single number — the number of angles that do not equal 180 degrees in the graph of the polyline that equals the sum of the given functions.ExamplesInput11 0Output1Input31 00 2-1 1Output2Input3-2 -41 7-5 1Output3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a4cc1c45", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ functions, where each function is of the form $f_i(x) = ki + bi$.  \n\nFind the number of angles in the graph of the function $g(x) = f_1(x) + f_2(x) + ... + f_n(x)$ that are not equal to 180 degrees. \n\nThe graph of $g(x)$ is a polyline."}, {"prompt_md5": "f7ce2de8", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a set of lines.
