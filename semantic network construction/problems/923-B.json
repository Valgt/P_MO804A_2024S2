Producing Snowtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice likes snow a lot! Unfortunately, this year's winter is already over, and she can't expect to have any more of it. Bob has thus bought her a gift — a large snow maker. He plans to make some amount of snow every day. On dayihe will make a pile of snow of volumeViand put it in her garden.Each day, every pile will shrink a little due to melting. More precisely, when the temperature on a given day isTi, each pile will reduce its volume byTi. If this would reduce the volume of a pile to or below zero, it disappears forever. All snow piles are independent of each other.Note that the pile made on dayialready loses part of its volume on the same day. In an extreme case, this may mean that there are no piles left at the end of a particular day.You are given the initial pile sizes and the temperature on each day. Determine the total volume of snow melted on each day.InputThe first line contains a single integerN(1 ≤N≤ 105) — the number of days.The second line containsNintegersV1,V2, ...,VN(0 ≤Vi≤ 109), whereViis the initial size of a snow pile made on the dayi.The third line containsNintegersT1,T2, ...,TN(0 ≤Ti≤ 109), whereTiis the temperature on the dayi.OutputOutput a single line withNintegers, where thei-th integer represents the total volume of snow melted on dayi.ExamplesInput310 10 55 7 2Output5 12 4Input530 25 20 15 109 10 12 4 13Output9 20 35 11 25NoteIn the first sample, Bob first makes a snow pile of volume 10, which melts to the size of 5 on the same day. On the second day, he makes another pile of size 10. Since it is a bit warmer than the day before, the first pile disappears completely while the second pile shrinks to 3. At the end of the second day, he has only a single pile of size 3. On the third day he makes a smaller pile than usual, but as the temperature dropped too, both piles survive till the end of the day.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0c675133", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of snow pile sizes ($V_1, V_2, ..., V_N$) created each day and a list of temperatures ($T_1, T_2, ..., T_N$) for each day.
