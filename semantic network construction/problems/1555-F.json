Good Graphtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have an undirected graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices with weighted edges.A simple cycle is a cycle of the graph without repeated vertices. Let theweightof the cycle be theXORof weights of edges it consists of.Let's say the graph isgoodif all itssimplecycles have weight $$$1$$$. A graph is bad if it's not good.Initially, the graph is empty. Then $$$q$$$ queries follow. Each query has the next type:$$$u$$$ $$$v$$$ $$$x$$$ — add edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ of weight $$$x$$$ if it doesn't make the graph bad.For each query print, was the edge added or not.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices and queries.Next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries — one per line. Each query contains three integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u, v \\\\le n$$$; $$$u \\\\neq v$$$; $$$0 \\\\le x \\\\le 1$$$) — the vertices of the edge and its weight.It's guaranteed that there are no multiple edges in the input.OutputFor each query, printYESif the edge was added to the graph, orNOotherwise (both case-insensitive).ExampleInput9 12 6 1 0 1 3 1 3 6 0 6 2 0 6 4 1 3 4 1 2 4 0 2 5 0 4 5 0 7 8 1 8 9 1 9 7 0OutputYES YES YES YES YES NO YES YES NO YES YES NO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "187d0577", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an undirected graph with $n$ vertices and weighted edges.
