You can do the following operation.Select one doll on $$$(x,y)$$$. Remove it and place a doll on $$$(x,y+1)$$$ and place a doll on $$$(x+1,y)$$$.Note that multiple dolls can be present at a cell at the same time; in one operation, you remove only one.

In the given grid, cells $$$(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)$$$ are white, and all other cells are black. Let us use triples to describe the grid: triple $$$(x,y,z)$$$ means that there are $$$z$$$ dolls placed on cell $$$(x,y)$$$. Initially the state of the grid is $$$(0,0,1)$$$.One of the optimal sequence of operations is as follows:Do the operation with $$$(0,0)$$$. Now the state of the grid is $$$(1,0,1),(0,1,1)$$$.Do the operation with $$$(0,1)$$$. Now the state of the grid is $$$(1,0,1),(1,1,1),(0,2,1)$$$.Do the operation with $$$(1,0)$$$. Now the state of the grid is $$$(1,1,2),(0,2,1),(2,0,1)$$$.Do the operation with $$$(1,1)$$$. Now the state of the grid is $$$(1,1,1),(0,2,1),(2,0,1),(1,2,1),(2,1,1)$$$.Do the operation with $$$(1,1)$$$.
