Guard Duty (medium)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPrincess Heidi decided to give orders to all herKRebel ship commanders in person. Unfortunately, she is currently travelling through hyperspace, and will leave it only atNspecific momentst1,t2, ...,tN. The meetings with commanders must therefore start and stop at those times. Namely, each commander will board her ship at some timetiand disembark at some later timetj. Of course, Heidi needs to meet with all commanders, and no two meetings can be held during the same time. Two commanders cannot even meet at the beginnings/endings of the hyperspace jumps, because too many ships in one position could give out their coordinates to the enemy.Your task is to find minimum time that Princess Heidi has to spend on meetings, with her schedule satisfying the conditions above.InputThe first line contains two integersK,N(2 ≤ 2K≤N≤ 500000,K≤ 5000). The second line containsNdistinct integerst1,t2, ...,tN(1 ≤ti≤ 109) representing the times when Heidi leaves hyperspace.OutputOutput only one integer: the minimum time spent on meetings.ExamplesInput2 51 4 6 7 12Output4Input3 66 3 4 2 5 1Output3Input4 1215 7 4 19 3 30 14 1 5 23 17 25Output6NoteIn the first example, there are five valid schedules:[1, 4], [6, 7]with total time 4,[1, 4], [6, 12]with total time 9,[1, 4], [7, 12]with total time 8,[1, 6], [7, 12]with total time 10, and[4, 6], [7, 12]with total time 7. So the answer is 4.In the second example, there is only 1 valid schedule:[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6].For the third example, one possible schedule with total time 6 is:[1, 3], [4, 5], [14, 15], [23, 25].", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4cb1b86f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $K$ tasks and $N$ time points $t_1, t_2, ..., t_N$ ($2 \\le K \\le N \\le 500000$, $1 \\le t_i \\le 10^9$).
