GCD Arraystime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputConsider the array $$$a$$$ composed of all the integers in the range $$$[l, r]$$$. For example, if $$$l = 3$$$ and $$$r = 7$$$, then $$$a = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$$$.Given $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$k$$$, is it possible for $$$\\\\gcd(a)$$$ to be greater than $$$1$$$ after doing the following operation at most $$$k$$$ times?Choose $$$2$$$ numbers from $$$a$$$.Permanently remove one occurrence of each of them from the array.Insert their product back into $$$a$$$.$$$\\\\gcd(b)$$$ denotes thegreatest common divisor (GCD)of the integers in $$$b$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases.

After the first operation the array can change to: $$$[3, 20]$$$, $$$[4, 15]$$$ or $$$[5, 12]$$$ all of which having their greatest common divisor equal to $$$1$$$ so the answer is \"NO\".For the third test case, $$$a = [13]$$$, so the answer is \"YES\", since the only element in the array is $$$13$$$.For the fourth test case, $$$a = [4]$$$, so the answer is \"YES\", since the only element in the array is $$$4$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f62feafb", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a range of numbers  [$l$, $r$].  \n\nYou can perform the following operation at most $k$ times:\n\n1.
