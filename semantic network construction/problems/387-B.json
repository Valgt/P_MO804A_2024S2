George and Roundtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutGeorge decided to prepare a Codesecrof round, so he has preparedmproblems for the round. Let's number the problems with integers1throughm. George estimates thei-th problem's complexity by integerbi.To make the roundgood, he needs to put at leastnproblems there. Besides, he needs to have at least one problem with complexity exactlya1, at least one with complexity exactlya2, ..., and at least one with complexity exactlyan. Of course, the round can also have problems with other complexities.George has a poor imagination. It's easier for him to make some already prepared problem simpler than to come up with a new one and prepare it. George is magnificent at simplifying problems. He can simplify any already prepared problem with complexitycto any positive integer complexityd(c≥d), by changing limits on the input data.However, nothing is so simple. George understood that even if he simplifies some problems, he can run out of problems for agoodround. That's why he decided to find out the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in addition to themhe's prepared in order to make a good round. Note that George can come up with a new problem of any complexity.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 3000) — the minimal number of problems in a good round and the number of problems George's prepared. The second line contains space-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤a1<a2< ... <an≤ 106) — the requirements for the complexity of the problems in a good round. The third line contains space-separated integersb1,b2, ...,bm(1 ≤b1≤b2... ≤bm≤ 106) — the complexities of the problems prepared by George.OutputPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput3 51 2 31 2 2 3 3Output0Input3 51 2 31 1 1 1 1Output2Input3 12 3 41Output3NoteIn the first sample the set of the prepared problems meets the requirements for a good round.In the second sample, it is enough to come up with and prepare two problems with complexities2and3to get a good round.In the third sample it is very easy to get a good round if come up with and prepare extra problems with complexities:2, 3, 4.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e781c9f5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two lists of integers:\n\n*  A list of $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ representing the required complexities of problems in a \"good\" round.\n* A list of $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, ..., b_m$ representing the complexities of problems already prepared.\n\nYou can simplify any problem with complexity $c$ to any positive integer complexity $d$ ($c \\ge d$) by changing input data limits.\n\nFind the minimum number of new problems you need to create, each with a unique complexity, to ensure you have a \"good\" round."}, {"prompt_md5": "84d28e6e", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You have a set of items with given complexities.
