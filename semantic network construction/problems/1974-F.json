Cutting Gametime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob were playing a game again. They have a grid of size $$$a \\\\times b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 10^9$$$), on which there are $$$n$$$ chips, with at most one chip in each cell. The cell at the intersection of the $$$x$$$-th row and the $$$y$$$-th column has coordinates $$$(x, y)$$$.Alice made the first move, and the players took turns. On each move, a player could cut several (but not all) rows or columns from the beginning or end of the remaining grid and earn a point for each chip that was on the cut part of the grid. Each move can be described by the character 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and an integer $$$k$$$:If the character is 'U', then the first $$$k$$$ remaining rows will be cut;If the character is 'D', then the last $$$k$$$ remaining rows will be cut;If the character is 'L', then the first $$$k$$$ remaining columns will be cut;If the character is 'R', then the last $$$k$$$ remaining columns will be cut.Based on the initial state of the grid and the players' moves, determine the number of points earned by Alice and Bob, respectively.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$n$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the dimensions of the grid, the number of chips, and the number of moves.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i \\\\le a$$$, $$$1 \\\\le y_i \\\\le b$$$) — the coordinates of the chips. All pairs of coordinates are distinct.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contain a character $$$c_j$$$ and an integer $$$k_j$$$ — the description of the $$$j$$$-th move. It is guaranteed that $$$k$$$ isless thanthe number of rows/columns in the current grid. In other words, a player cannot cut the entire remaining grid on their move.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases in the test does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$m$$$ across all test cases in the test does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output two integers — the number of points earned by Alice and Bob, respectively.ExampleInput64 4 3 24 13 32 4D 2R 14 4 3 34 13 22 3D 1L 1U 23 5 3 21 32 23 3R 2R 26 4 4 21 42 35 31 1R 1U 19 3 2 16 13 3D 810 10 2 57 59 1R 1L 2D 1U 4D 1Output2 1 2 0 0 3 1 1 2 0 0 1NoteBelow is the game from the first example:On her turn, Alice cut $$$2$$$ rows from the bottom and scored $$$2$$$ points, then Bob cut $$$1$$$ column from the right and scored one point.
