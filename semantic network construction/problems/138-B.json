Andrey's friends gave him two identical numbersnas a New Year present. He hung them on a wall and watched them adoringly.Then Andrey got bored from looking at the same number and he started to swap digits first in one, then in the other number, then again in the first number and so on (arbitrary number of changes could be made in each number). At some point it turned out that if we sum the resulting numbers, then the number of zeroes with which the sum will end would be maximum among the possible variants of digit permutations in those numbers.Given numbern, can you find the two digit permutations that have this property?InputThe first line contains a positive integernâ€” the original number. The number of digits in this number does not exceed105. The number is written without any leading zeroes.OutputPrint two permutations of digits of numbern, such that the sum of these numbers ends with the maximum number of zeroes. The permutations can have leading zeroes (if they are present, they all should be printed). The permutations do not have to be different. If there are several answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput198Output981819Input500Output500500", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5e276453", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a positive integer $n$.
