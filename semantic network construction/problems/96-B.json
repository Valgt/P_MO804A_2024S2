Help him to find the least super lucky number which is not less thann.InputThe only line contains a positive integern(1 ≤n≤ 109). This number doesn't have leading zeroes.OutputOutput the least super lucky number that is more than or equal ton.Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.
