Initially the chessboard is empty. Vasya will consequently put the rooks on the board one after another.The cell of the field is under rook's attack, if there is at least one rook located in the same row or in the same column with this cell. If there is a rook located in the cell, this cell is also under attack.You are given the positions of the board where Vasya will put rooks. For each rook you have to determine the number of cells which arenot under attackafter Vasya puts it on the board.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 100 000,1 ≤m≤min(100 000,n2)) — the size of the board and the number of rooks.Each of the nextmlines contains integersxiandyi(1 ≤xi,yi≤n) — the number of the row and the number of the column where Vasya will put thei-th rook. Vasya puts rooks on the board in the order they appear in the input.
