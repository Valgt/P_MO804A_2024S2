He walked about the supermarket for a long time and got a basket full of products. Now he needs to choose the cashier to pay for the products.There arencashiers at the exit from the supermarket. At the moment the queue for thei-th cashier already haskipeople. Thej-th person standing in the queue to thei-th cashier hasmi,jitems in the basket. Vasya knows that:the cashier needs 5 seconds to scan one item;after the cashier scans each item of some customer, he needs 15 seconds to take the customer's money and give him the change.Of course, Vasya wants to select a queue so that he can leave the supermarket as soon as possible. Help him write a program that displays the minimum number of seconds after which Vasya can get to one of the cashiers.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of cashes in the shop. The second line containsnspace-separated integers:k1,k2, ...,kn(1 ≤ki≤ 100), wherekiis the number of people in the queue to thei-th cashier.Thei-th of the nextnlines containskispace-separated integers:mi, 1,mi, 2, ...,mi,ki(1 ≤mi,j≤ 100) — the number of products thej-th person in the queue for thei-th cash has.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum number of seconds Vasya needs to get to the cashier.ExamplesInput111Output20Input41 4 3 21001 2 2 31 9 17 8Output100NoteIn the second test sample, if Vasya goes to the first queue, he gets to the cashier in100·5 + 15 = 515seconds. But if he chooses the second queue, he will need1·5 + 2·5 + 2·5 + 3·5 + 4·15 = 100seconds. He will need1·5 + 9·5 + 1·5 + 3·15 = 100seconds for the third one and7·5 + 8·5 + 2·15 = 105seconds for the fourth one. Thus, Vasya gets to the cashier quicker if he chooses the second or the third queue.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ea18c697", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ cashiers.
