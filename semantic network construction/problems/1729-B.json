Decode Stringtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp has a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.He encodes it using the following algorithm.He goes through the letters of the string $$$s$$$ from left to right and for each letter Polycarp considers its number in the alphabet:if the letter number is single-digit number (less than $$$10$$$), then just writes it out;if the letter number is a two-digit number (greater than or equal to $$$10$$$), then it writes it out and adds the number0after.For example, if the string $$$s$$$ iscode, then Polycarp will encode this string as follows:'c' — is the $$$3$$$-rd letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds3to the code (the code becomes equal to3);'o' — is the $$$15$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds15to the code and also0(the code becomes3150);'d' — is the $$$4$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds4to the code (the code becomes31504);'e' — is the $$$5$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Therefore, Polycarp adds5to the code (the code becomes315045).Thus, code of stringcodeis315045.You are given a string $$$t$$$ resulting from encoding the string $$$s$$$. Your task is to decode it (get the original string $$$s$$$ by $$$t$$$).InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the input.The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of description of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$) — the length of the given code.The second line of the description of each test case contains a string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ — the given code. It is guaranteed that there exists such a string of lowercase Latin letters, as a result of encoding which the string $$$t$$$ is obtained.OutputFor each test case output the required string $$$s$$$ — the string that gives string $$$t$$$ as the result of encoding. It is guaranteed that such a string always exists. It can be shown that such a string is always unique.ExampleInput963150454110071213121612012018315045615018035190711111107111110051111142606Outputcode aj abacaba ll codeforces aaaak aaaaj aaaaa zfNoteThe first test case is explained above.In the second test case, the answer isaj. Indeed, the number of the letterais equal to $$$1$$$, so1will be appended to the code. The number of the letterjis $$$10$$$, so100will be appended to the code. The resulting code is1100.There are no zeros in the third test case, which means that the numbers of all letters are less than $$$10$$$ and are encoded as one digit. The original string isabacaba.In the fourth test case, the string $$$s$$$ is equal toll. The letterlhas the number $$$12$$$ and is encoded as120.
