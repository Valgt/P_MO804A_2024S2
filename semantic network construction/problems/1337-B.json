Kana and Dragon Quest gametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKana was just an ordinary high school girl before a talent scout discovered her. Then, she became an idol. But different from the stereotype, she is also a gameholic.One day Kana gets interested in a new adventure game calledDragon Quest. In this game, her quest is to beat a dragon.The dragon has ahit pointof $$$x$$$ initially. When itshit pointgoes to $$$0$$$ or under $$$0$$$, it will be defeated. In order to defeat the dragon, Kana can cast the two following types of spells.Void AbsorptionAssume that the dragon's currenthit pointis $$$h$$$, aftercastingthis spell itshit pointwill become $$$\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{h}{2} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + 10$$$. Here $$$\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{h}{2} \\\\right\\\\rfloor$$$ denotes $$$h$$$ divided by two, rounded down.Lightning StrikeThis spell will decrease the dragon'shit pointby $$$10$$$. Assume that the dragon's currenthit pointis $$$h$$$, aftercastingthis spell itshit pointwill be lowered to $$$h-10$$$.Due to some reasons Kana can onlycastno more than$$$n$$$Void Absorptionsand $$$m$$$Lightning Strikes. She can cast the spells in any order anddoesn't have tocast all the spells. Kana isn't good at math, so you are going to help her to find out whether it is possible to defeat the dragon.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$)  — the number of test cases.The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases. For each test case the only line contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1\\\\le x \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$0\\\\le n,m\\\\le30$$$)  — the dragon's intitialhit point, the maximum number ofVoid AbsorptionsandLightning StrikesKana cancastrespectively.OutputIf it is possible to defeat the dragon, print \"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).ExampleInput7 100 3 4 189 3 4 64 2 3 63 2 3 30 27 7 10 9 1 69117 21 2OutputYES NO NO YES YES YES YESNoteOne possible casting sequence of the first test case is shown below:Void Absorption$$$\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{100}{2} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + 10=60$$$.Lightning Strike$$$60-10=50$$$.Void Absorption$$$\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{50}{2} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + 10=35$$$.Void Absorption$$$\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{35}{2} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + 10=27$$$.Lightning Strike$$$27-10=17$$$.Lightning Strike$$$17-10=7$$$.Lightning Strike$$$7-10=-3$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "061e4836", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a dragon with a certain amount of hit points ($x$).
