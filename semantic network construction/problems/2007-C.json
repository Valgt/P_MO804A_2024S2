Dora and C++time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDora has just learned the programming language C++!However, she has completely misunderstood the meaning of C++. She considers it as two kinds of adding operations on the array $$$c$$$ with $$$n$$$ elements. Dora has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. In one operation, she can choose one of the following things to do.Choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$, and increase $$$c_i$$$ by $$$a$$$.Choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$, and increase $$$c_i$$$ by $$$b$$$.Note that $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ areconstants, and they can be the same.Let's define arangeof array $$$d$$$ as $$$\\\\max(d_i) - \\\\min(d_i)$$$. For instance, the range of the array $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$ is $$$4 - 1 = 3$$$, the range of the array $$$[5, 2, 8, 2, 2, 1]$$$ is $$$8 - 1 = 7$$$, and the range of the array $$$[3, 3, 3]$$$ is $$$3 - 3 = 0$$$.After any number of operations (possibly, $$$0$$$), Dora calculates the range of the new array. You need to help Dora minimize this value, but since Dora loves exploring all by herself, you only need to tell her the minimized value.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq a, b \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the array $$$c$$$ and the constant values, respectively.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq c_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the initial elements of the array $$$c$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible range of the array after any number of operations.ExampleInput104 5 51 3 4 44 2 31 3 4 64 7 71 1 2 63 15 91 9 53 18 121 4 57 27 3633 13 23 12 35 24 4110 6 915 5 6 9 8 2 12 15 3 82 1 10000000001 10000000006 336718728 709848696552806726 474775724 15129785 371139304 178408298 131060716 335734893 671469786138885253 70095920 456876775 9345665 214704906 375508929Output3 0 3 2 3 5 1 0 17 205359241NoteIn the first test case, we can increase $$$c_1 = 1$$$ by $$$a = 5$$$. The array $$$c$$$ will become $$$[6, 3, 4, 4]$$$, and the range is $$$3$$$. Note that there is more than one way to reach the answer.In the second test case, we can increase $$$c_1 = 1$$$ by $$$a = 2$$$ and then increase $$$c_1 = 3$$$ by $$$b = 3$$$. Also, we can increase $$$c_2 = 3$$$ by $$$b = 3$$$ and increase $$$c_3 = 4$$$ by $$$a = 2$$$. The array $$$c$$$ will become $$$[6, 6, 6, 6]$$$, and the range is $$$0$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4d0c65a6", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $c$ with $n$ elements.
