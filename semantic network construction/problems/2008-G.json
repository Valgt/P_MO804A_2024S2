Sakurako's Tasktime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSakurako has prepared a task for you:She gives you an array of $$$n$$$ integers and allows you to choose $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$i \\\\neq j$$$ and $$$a_i \\\\ge a_j$$$, and then assign $$$a_i = a_i - a_j$$$ or $$$a_i = a_i + a_j$$$. You can perform this operation any number of times for any $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, as long as they satisfy the conditions.Sakurako asks you what is the maximum possible value of $$$mex_k$$$$$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$$ of the array after any number of operations.$$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$$$$$mex_k$$$ is the $$$k$$$-th non-negative integer that is absent in the array. For example, $$$mex_1(\\\\{1,2,3 \\\\})=0$$$, since $$$0$$$ is the first element that is not in the array, and $$$mex_2(\\\\{0,2,4 \\\\})=3$$$, since $$$3$$$ is the second element that is not in the array.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5,1\\\\le k\\\\le 10^9$$$)  — the number of elements in the array and the value $$$k$$$ for $$$mex_k$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le a_i\\\\le 10^9$$$)  — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the maximum $$$mex_k$$$ that can be achieved through the operations.ExampleInput61 332 101 13 11 2 33 21 2 44 52 2 2 164 52 2 2 3Output2 11 3 4 8 8", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "dfc1fd67", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers.
