Tokitsukaze and Strange Rectangletime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ points on the plane, the $$$i$$$-th of which is at $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$. Tokitsukaze wants to draw a strange rectangular area and pick all the points in the area.The strange area is enclosed by three lines, $$$x = l$$$, $$$y = a$$$ and $$$x = r$$$, as its left side, its bottom side and its right side respectively, where $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ and $$$a$$$ can be any real numbers satisfying that $$$l < r$$$. The upper side of the area is boundless, which you can regard as a line parallel to the $$$x$$$-axis at infinity. The following figure shows a strange rectangular area.A point $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ is in the strange rectangular area if and only if $$$l < x_i < r$$$ and $$$y_i > a$$$. For example, in the above figure, $$$p_1$$$ is in the area while $$$p_2$$$ is not.Tokitsukaze wants to know how many different non-empty sets she can obtain by picking all the points in a strange rectangular area, where we think two sets are different if there exists at least one point in one set of them but not in the other.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\times 10^5$$$) — the number of points on the plane.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x_i, y_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point.All points are distinct.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of different non-empty sets of points she can obtain.ExamplesInput31 11 21 3Output3Input31 12 13 1Output6Input42 12 23 13 2Output6NoteFor the first example, there is exactly one set having $$$k$$$ points for $$$k = 1, 2, 3$$$, so the total number is $$$3$$$.For the second example, the numbers of sets having $$$k$$$ points for $$$k = 1, 2, 3$$$ are $$$3$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$1$$$ respectively, and their sum is $$$6$$$.For the third example, as the following figure shows, there are$$$2$$$ sets having one point;$$$3$$$ sets having two points;$$$1$$$ set having four points.Therefore, the number of different non-empty sets in this example is $$$2 + 3 + 0 + 1 = 6$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c2e5df48", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ points on a 2D plane, each with coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$.  \n\nYou need to determine the number of unique sets of points that can be formed by drawing a rectangle with the following properties:\n\n* The left side of the rectangle is the vertical line $x=l$.\n* The bottom side of the rectangle is the horizontal line $y=a$.\n* The right side of the rectangle is the vertical line $x=r$.\n\nA point $(x_i, y_i)$ is inside the rectangle if and only if $l < x_i < r$ and $y_i > a$.\n\nTwo sets of points are considered different if they contain at least one point that is in one set but not the other."}, {"prompt_md5": "d104d039", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a set of points on a plane.
