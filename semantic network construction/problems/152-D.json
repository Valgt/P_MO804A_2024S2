Framestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutOne day Vasya got hold of a sheet of checkered papern×msquares in size. Our Vasya adores geometrical figures, so he painted two rectangles on the paper. The rectangles' sides are parallel to the coordinates' axes, also the length of each side of each rectangle is no less than 3 squares and the sides are painted by the grid lines. The sides can also be part of the sheet of paper's edge. Then Vasya hatched all squares on the rectangles'frames.Let's define a rectangle's frame as the set of squaresinsidethe rectangle that share at least one side with its border.A little later Vasya found a sheet of paper of exactly the same size and couldn't guess whether it is the same sheet of paper or a different one. So, he asked you to check whether the sheet of paper he had found contains two painted frames and nothing besides them.Please note that the frames painted by Vasya can arbitrarily intersect, overlap or even completely coincide.The coordinates on the sheet of paper are introduced in such a way that theXaxis goes from top to bottom, thexcoordinates of the squares' numbers take values from1tonand theYaxis goes from the left to the right and theycoordinates of the squares' numbers take values from1tom.InputThe first input line contains two integersnandm(3 ≤n,m≤ 1000) — the sizes of the sheet of paper Vasya found. Nextnlines, each consisting ofmsymbols \".\" (dot) and \"#\" (number sign), describe the found sheet of paper. The symbol \"#\" represents a hatched square and the symbol \".\" represents a non-hatched square.OutputIn the first line print the single word \"YES\" or \"NO\", meaning whether it is true that the found sheet of paper has two frames painted on it. If the answer is positive, then print in the second line4integers: the coordinates of the upper left and lower right corners of the first frame. In the third line print4integers: the coordinates of the upper left and the lower right corners of the second frame. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput4 5######.#.####.######OutputYES1 1 3 31 1 4 5Input5 6...###...########.#...#.#####.OutputNONoteIn the first sample there are two frames on the picture.
