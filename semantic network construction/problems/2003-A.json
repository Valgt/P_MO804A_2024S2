Turtle and Good Stringstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTurtle thinks a string $$$s$$$ is a good string if there exists a sequence of strings $$$t_1, t_2, \\\\ldots, t_k$$$ ($$$k$$$ is an arbitrary integer) such that:$$$k \\\\ge 2$$$.$$$s = t_1 + t_2 + \\\\ldots + t_k$$$, where $$$+$$$ represents the concatenation operation. For example, $$$\\\\texttt{abc} = \\\\texttt{a} + \\\\texttt{bc}$$$.For all $$$1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le k$$$, the first character of $$$t_i$$$isn't equal tothe last character of $$$t_j$$$.Turtle is given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Please tell him whether the string $$$s$$$ is a good string!InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) â€” the length of the string.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" if the string $$$s$$$ is a good string, and \"NO\" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.ExampleInput42aa3aba4abcb12abcabcabcabcOutputNo nO Yes YESNoteIn the first test case, the sequence of strings $$$\\\\texttt{a}, \\\\texttt{a}$$$ satisfies the condition $$$s = t_1 + t_2 + \\\\ldots + t_k$$$, but the first character of $$$t_1$$$ is equal to the last character of $$$t_2$$$. It can be seen that there doesn't exist any sequence of strings which satisfies all of the conditions, so the answer is \"NO\".In the third test case, the sequence of strings $$$\\\\texttt{ab}, \\\\texttt{cb}$$$ satisfies all of the conditions.In the fourth test case, the sequence of strings $$$\\\\texttt{abca}, \\\\texttt{bcab}, \\\\texttt{cabc}$$$ satisfies all of the conditions.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6ecb0f39", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a string of lowercase letters, determine if it can be split into a sequence of substrings where:\n\n* The total length of the string is equal to the concatenation of all substrings.\n* The first character of each substring is different from the last character of the next substring.\n\nIf such a split is possible, output \"YES\".
