Maximum Balanced Circletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ people in a row. The height of the $$$i$$$-th person is $$$a_i$$$. You can chooseanysubset of these people and try to arrange them into abalanced circle.Abalanced circleis such an order of people that the difference between heights of any adjacent people is no more than $$$1$$$. For example, let heights of chosen people be $$$[a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\\\dots, a_{i_k}]$$$, where $$$k$$$ is the number of people you choose. Then the condition $$$|a_{i_j} - a_{i_{j + 1}}| \\\\le 1$$$ should be satisfied for all $$$j$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k-1$$$ and the condition $$$|a_{i_1} - a_{i_k}| \\\\le 1$$$ should be also satisfied. $$$|x|$$$ means the absolute value of $$$x$$$. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced.Your task is to choose the maximum number of people and construct abalanced circleconsisting of all chosen people. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced so the answer always exists.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of people.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the height of the $$$i$$$-th person.OutputIn the first line of the output print $$$k$$$ — the number of people in the maximumbalanced circle.In the second line print $$$k$$$ integers $$$res_1, res_2, \\\\dots, res_k$$$, where $$$res_j$$$ is theheightof the $$$j$$$-th person in the maximumbalanced circle. The condition $$$|res_{j} - res_{j + 1}| \\\\le 1$$$ should be satisfied for all $$$j$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k-1$$$ and the condition $$$|res_{1} - res_{k}| \\\\le 1$$$ should be also satisfied.ExamplesInput7 4 3 5 1 2 2 1Output5 2 1 1 2 3Input5 3 7 5 1 5Output2 5 5Input3 5 1 4Output2 4 5Input7 2 2 3 2 1 2 2Output7 1 2 2 2 2 3 2", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "630b8be0", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a line of $n$ people, each with a height $a_i$.
