That's why instead of Ded Moroz he was visited by his teammate Andrew, who solemnly presented him with a set ofndistinct primenumbers alongside with a simple task: Oleg is to find thek-th smallest integer, such thatallits prime divisors are in this set.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 16).The next line listsndistinct prime numbersp1,p2, ...,pn(2 ≤pi≤ 100) in ascending order.The last line gives a single integerk(1 ≤k).
