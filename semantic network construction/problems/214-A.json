But now Furik wants to get a good mark for math. For that Ms. Ivanova, his math teacher, gave him a new task. Furik solved the task immediately. Can you?You are given a system of equations:You should count, how many there are pairs of integers(a,b)(0 ≤a,b)which satisfy the system.InputA single line contains two integersn,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 1000)— the parameters of the system. The numbers on the line are separated by a space.OutputOn a single line print the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput9 3Output1Input14 28Output1Input4 20Output0NoteIn the first sample the suitable pair is integers(3, 0). In the second sample the suitable pair is integers(3, 5).
