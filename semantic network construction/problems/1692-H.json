The game at the casino works like this.Before each round, the player selects a number between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^9$$$. After that, a dice with $$$10^9$$$ faces is rolled so that a random number between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^9$$$ appears. If the player guesses the number correctly their total money is doubled, else their total money is halved.Marian predicted the future and knows all the numbers $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n$$$ that the dice will show in the next $$$n$$$ rounds.He will pick three integers $$$a$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$l \\\\leq r$$$). He will play $$$r-l+1$$$ rounds (rounds between $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ inclusive). In each of these rounds, he will guess the same number $$$a$$$. At the start (before the round $$$l$$$) he has $$$1$$$ dollar.Marian asks you to determine the integers $$$a$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a \\\\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq n$$$) such that he makes the most money at the end.Note that during halving and multiplying there is no rounding and there are no precision errors. So, for example during a game, Marian could have money equal to $$$\\\\dfrac{1}{1024}$$$, $$$\\\\dfrac{1}{128}$$$, $$$\\\\dfrac{1}{2}$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, etc. (any value of $$$2^t$$$, where $$$t$$$ is an integer of any sign).InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of rounds.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$), where $$$x_i$$$ is the number that will fall on the dice in the $$$i$$$-th round.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output three integers $$$a$$$, $$$l$$$, and $$$r$$$ such that Marian makes the most amount of money gambling with his strategy. If there are multiple answers, you may output any of them.ExampleInput454 4 3 4 4511 1 11 1 1111000000000108 8 8 9 9 6 6 9 6 6Output4 1 5 1 2 2 1000000000 1 1 6 6 10NoteFor the first test case, the best choice is $$$a=4$$$, $$$l=1$$$, $$$r=5$$$, and the game would go as follows.Marian starts with one dollar.After the first round, he ends up with $$$2$$$ dollars because the numbers coincide with the chosen one.After the second round, he ends up with $$$4$$$ dollars because the numbers coincide again.After the third round, he ends up with $$$2$$$ dollars because he guesses $$$4$$$ even though $$$3$$$ is the correct choice.After the fourth round, he ends up with $$$4$$$ dollars again.In the final round, he ends up $$$8$$$ dollars because he again guessed correctly.There are many possible answers for the second test case, but it can be proven that Marian will not end up with more than $$$2$$$ dollars, so any choice with $$$l = r$$$ with the appropriate $$$a$$$ is acceptable.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "07e23f15", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ integers, $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$, representing the outcomes of a dice roll in $n$ consecutive rounds.  \n\nYou need to choose three integers $a$, $l$, and $r$ ($1 \\le a \\le 10^9$, $1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$) to determine a gambling strategy.\n\nIn this strategy, you will:\n\n*  Choose a single number $a$ to guess in each round.\n*  Play $r-l+1$ rounds, starting from round $l$ and ending at round $r$.\n\nThe rules of the game are:\n\n* If your guess $a$ matches the dice roll $x_i$ in a round, your money doubles.\n* If your guess $a$ does not match the dice roll $x_i$ in a round, your money is halved.\n\nYou start with $1$ dollar.\n\nFind the values of $a$, $l$, and $r$ that maximize your final amount of money after playing the chosen rounds."}, {"prompt_md5": "787295c3", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a sequence of numbers.
