Divisible Pairstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp has two favorite integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ (they can be equal), and he has found an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.Polycarp considers a pair of indices $$$\\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n$$$)beautifulif:$$$a_i + a_j$$$ is divisible by $$$x$$$;$$$a_i - a_j$$$ is divisible by $$$y$$$.For example, if $$$x=5$$$, $$$y=2$$$, $$$n=6$$$, $$$a=$$$[$$$1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6$$$], then the onlybeautifulpairs are:$$$\\\\langle 1, 5 \\\\rangle$$$: $$$a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10$$$ ($$$10$$$ is divisible by $$$5$$$) and $$$a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8$$$ ($$$-8$$$ is divisible by $$$2$$$);$$$\\\\langle 4, 6 \\\\rangle$$$: $$$a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10$$$ ($$$10$$$ is divisible by $$$5$$$) and $$$a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2$$$ ($$$-2$$$ is divisible by $$$2$$$).Find the number ofbeautifulpairs in the array $$$a$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, and $$$y$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le x, y \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number ofbeautifulpairs in the array $$$a$$$.ExampleInput76 5 21 2 7 4 9 67 9 51 10 15 3 8 12 159 4 1014 10 2 2 11 11 13 5 69 5 610 7 6 7 9 7 7 10 109 6 24 9 7 1 2 2 13 3 159 2 314 6 1 15 12 15 8 2 1510 5 713 3 3 2 12 11 3 7 13 14Output2 0 1 3 5 7 0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ba3223ed", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a$ of length $n$ and two integers $x$ and $y$.  \n\nA pair of indices $(i, j)$ ($1 \\le i < j \\le n$) is considered \"beautiful\" if:\n\n* $a_i + a_j$ is divisible by $x$\n* $a_i - a_j$ is divisible by $y$\n\nFind the number of beautiful pairs in the array $a$."}, {"prompt_md5": "37a6b452", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given an array of numbers and two target numbers, count how many pairs of indices in the array result in the sum of the numbers at those indices being divisible by the first target number and the difference of the numbers at those indices being divisible by the second target number."}]}
