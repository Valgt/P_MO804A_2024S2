Dreamoon and Ranking Collectiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDreamoon is a big fan of the Codeforces contests.One day, he claimed that he will collect all the places from $$$1$$$ to $$$54$$$ after two more rated contests. It's amazing!Based on this, you come up with the following problem:There is a person who participated in $$$n$$$ Codeforces rounds. His place in the first round is $$$a_1$$$, his place in the second round is $$$a_2$$$, ..., his place in the $$$n$$$-th round is $$$a_n$$$.You are given a positive non-zero integer $$$x$$$.Please, find the largest $$$v$$$ such that this person can collect all the places from $$$1$$$ to $$$v$$$ after $$$x$$$ more rated contests.In other words, you need to find the largest $$$v$$$, such that it is possible, that after $$$x$$$ more rated contests, for each $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq v$$$, there will exist a contest where this person took the $$$i$$$-th place.For example, if $$$n=6$$$, $$$x=2$$$ and $$$a=[3,1,1,5,7,10]$$$ then answer is $$$v=5$$$, because if on the next two contest he will take places $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$, then he will collect all places from $$$1$$$ to $$$5$$$, so it is possible to get $$$v=5$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 5$$$) denoting the number of test cases in the input.Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers $$$n, x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, x \\\\leq 100$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ positive non-zero integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 100$$$).OutputFor each test case print one line containing the largest $$$v$$$, such that it is possible that after $$$x$$$ other contests, for each $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq v$$$, there will exist a contest where this person took the $$$i$$$-th place.ExampleInput5 6 2 3 1 1 5 7 10 1 100 100 11 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 57 80 60 40 20Output5 101 2 2 60NoteThe first test case is described in the statement.In the second test case, the person has one hundred future contests, so he can take place $$$1,2,\\\\ldots,99$$$ and place $$$101$$$ on them in some order, to collect places $$$1,2,\\\\ldots,101$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7eb36365", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, representing the places a person achieved in the first $n$ contests.
