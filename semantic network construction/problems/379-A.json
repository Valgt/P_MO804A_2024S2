Vasily is smart, so he can makebwent out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.InputThe single line contains two integers,aandb(1 ≤a≤ 1000; 2 ≤b≤ 1000).OutputPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.ExamplesInput4 2Output7Input6 3Output8NoteConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle.
