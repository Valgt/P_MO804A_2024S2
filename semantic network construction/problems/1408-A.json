You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.InputThe first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$): the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$$$): the number of elements in the given sequences.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 100$$$).The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq b_i \\\\leq 100$$$).The fourth line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq c_i \\\\leq 100$$$).It is guaranteed that $$$a_i \\\\neq b_i$$$, $$$a_i \\\\neq c_i$$$, $$$b_i \\\\neq c_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers: $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$p_i \\\\in \\\\{a_i, b_i, c_i\\\\}$$$, $$$p_i \\\\neq p_{i \\\\mod n + 1}$$$).If there are several solutions, you can print any.ExampleInput5 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 3 4 3 4 7 1 3 3 1 1 1 1 2 4 4 3 2 2 4 4 2 2 2 4 4 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 3 3 1 2 10 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3Output1 2 3 1 2 1 2 1 3 4 3 2 4 2 1 3 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 2NoteIn the first test case $$$p = [1, 2, 3]$$$.It is a correct answer, because:$$$p_1 = 1 = a_1$$$, $$$p_2 = 2 = b_2$$$, $$$p_3 = 3 = c_3$$$$$$p_1 \\\\neq p_2 $$$, $$$p_2 \\\\neq p_3 $$$, $$$p_3 \\\\neq p_1$$$All possible correct answers to this test case are: $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 3]$$$, $$$[2, 3, 1]$$$, $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$.In the second test case $$$p = [1, 2, 1, 2]$$$.In this sequence $$$p_1 = a_1$$$, $$$p_2 = a_2$$$, $$$p_3 = a_3$$$, $$$p_4 = a_4$$$.
