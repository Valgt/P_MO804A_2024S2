In other words, $$$g$$$($$$x$$$) is the largest non-negative integer $$$z$$$, such that $$${f(x)}^{z}$$$ does not exceed $$$x$$$.You are given $$$q$$$ queries. The $$$i$$$-th query consists of two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$. The answer to the query is the sum of $$$g$$$($$$k$$$) across all integers $$$k$$$, such that $$$l_i \\\\leq k \\\\leq r_i$$$.
