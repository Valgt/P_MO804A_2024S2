For example, the array $$$[1,6,3,2]$$$ is good since $$$1+3+2=6$$$. Furthermore, the array $$$[0]$$$ is also good. However, the arrays $$$[1,2,3,4]$$$ and $$$[1]$$$ are not good.Alex has an array $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$. Help him count the number of good non-empty prefixes of the array $$$a$$$. In other words, count the number of integers $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$) such that the length $$$i$$$ prefix (i.e. $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_i$$$) is good.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of good non-empty prefixes of the array $$$a$$$.ExampleInput7101141 1 2 050 1 2 1 471 1 0 3 5 2 1271000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 294967296100 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 589934592Output1 0 3 3 4 1 2NoteIn the fourth test case, the array has five prefixes:prefix $$$[0]$$$ is a good array, as mentioned in the statement;prefix $$$[0, 1]$$$ is not a good array, since $$$0 \\\\ne 1$$$;prefix $$$[0, 1, 2]$$$ is not a good array, since $$$0 \\\\ne 1 + 2$$$, $$$1 \\\\ne 0 + 2$$$ and $$$2 \\\\ne 0 + 1$$$;prefix $$$[0, 1, 2, 1]$$$ is a good array, since $$$2 = 0 + 1 + 1$$$;prefix $$$[0, 1, 2, 1, 4]$$$ is a good array, since $$$4 = 0 + 1 + 2 + 1$$$.As you can see, three of them are good, so the answer is $$$3$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "87fd31ac", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
