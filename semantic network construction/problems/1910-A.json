Usernametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOn the official website of Berland, each account has two parameters: username and ID.Username is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or digits, which contains at least one letter. For example,user0,1fox1,zzzzare correct usernames, but1337andUser22are not.The ID of the account for a given username is generated as follows: apositive integer without leading zeroesis appended to the end of the username. For example, the IDuser0125can be generated by the following usernames:user012,user01,user0; but neither byusernorus.You are given a string $$$s$$$ — a valid ID. Your task is to determine any valid username that can generate the given ID. If there are several correct usernames, you can print any of them.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 50$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or digits.Additional constraint on input: there is at least one valid username that can generate the given ID.OutputFor each test case on a separate line, print a string — any valid username that can generate the given ID.
