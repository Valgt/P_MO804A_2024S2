Euclid Guesstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's consider Euclid's algorithm for finding thegreatest common divisor, where $$$t$$$ is a list:function Euclid(a, b):if a < b:swap(a, b)if b == 0:return ar = reminder from dividing a by bif r > 0:append r to the back of treturn Euclid(b, r)There is an array $$$p$$$ of pairs of positive integers that are not greater than $$$m$$$. Initially, the list $$$t$$$ is empty. Then the function is run on each pair in $$$p$$$.
