Two distinct pointstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two segments $$$[l_1; r_1]$$$ and $$$[l_2; r_2]$$$ on the $$$x$$$-axis. It is guaranteed that $$$l_1 < r_1$$$ and $$$l_2 < r_2$$$. Segmentsmay intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other.The example of two segments on the $$$x$$$-axis.Your problem is to find twointegers$$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that $$$l_1 \\\\le a \\\\le r_1$$$, $$$l_2 \\\\le b \\\\le r_2$$$ and $$$a \\\\ne b$$$. In other words, you have to choose twodistinctinteger points in such a way that the first point belongs to the segment $$$[l_1; r_1]$$$ and the second one belongs to the segment $$$[l_2; r_2]$$$.It is guaranteed thatthe answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can printanyof them.You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 500$$$) — the number of queries.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains four integers $$$l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}$$$ and $$$r_{2_i}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} \\\\le 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}$$$) — the ends of the segments in the $$$i$$$-th query.OutputPrint $$$2q$$$ integers. For the $$$i$$$-th query print two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ — such numbers that $$$l_{1_i} \\\\le a_i \\\\le r_{1_i}$$$, $$$l_{2_i} \\\\le b_i \\\\le r_{2_i}$$$ and $$$a_i \\\\ne b_i$$$.
