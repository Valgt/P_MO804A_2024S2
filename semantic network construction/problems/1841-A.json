Game with Boardtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob play a game. They have a blackboard; initially, there are $$$n$$$ integers written on it, and each integer is equal to $$$1$$$.Alice and Bob take turns; Alice goes first. On their turn, the player has to choose several (at least two)equalintegers on the board, wipe them and write a new integer which is equal to their sum.For example, if the board currently contains integers $$$\\\\{1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3\\\\}$$$, then the following moves are possible:choose two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipe them and write an integer $$$2$$$, then the board becomes $$$\\\\{2, 2, 2, 2, 3\\\\}$$$;choose two integers equal to $$$2$$$, wipe them and write an integer $$$4$$$, then the board becomes $$$\\\\{1, 1, 2, 3, 4\\\\}$$$;choose three integers equal to $$$2$$$, wipe them and write an integer $$$6$$$, then the board becomes $$$\\\\{1, 1, 3, 6\\\\}$$$.If a player cannot make a move (all integers on the board are different), that playerwins the game.Determine who wins if both players play optimally.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 99$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of integers equal to $$$1$$$ on the board.OutputFor each test case, printAliceif Alice wins when both players play optimally. Otherwise, printBob.ExampleInput236OutputBob AliceNoteIn the first test case, $$$n = 3$$$, so the board initially contains integers $$$\\\\{1, 1, 1\\\\}$$$. We can show that Bob can always win as follows: there are two possible first moves for Alice.if Alice chooses two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$2$$$, the board becomes $$$\\\\{1, 2\\\\}$$$. Bob cannot make a move, so he wins;if Alice chooses three integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$3$$$, the board becomes $$$\\\\{3\\\\}$$$. Bob cannot make a move, so he wins.In the second test case, $$$n = 6$$$, so the board initially contains integers $$$\\\\{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\\\\}$$$. Alice can win by, for example, choosing two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wiping them and writing $$$2$$$ on the first turn. Then the board becomes $$$\\\\{1, 1, 1, 1, 2\\\\}$$$, and there are three possible responses for Bob:if Bob chooses four integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$4$$$, the board becomes $$$\\\\{2,4\\\\}$$$. Alice cannot make a move, so she wins;if Bob chooses three integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$3$$$, the board becomes $$$\\\\{1,2,3\\\\}$$$. Alice cannot make a move, so she wins;if Bob chooses two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$2$$$, the board becomes $$$\\\\{1, 1, 2, 2\\\\}$$$. Alice can continue by, for example, choosing two integers equal to $$$2$$$, wiping them and writing $$$4$$$. Then the board becomes $$$\\\\{1,1,4\\\\}$$$. The only possible response for Bob is to choose two integers equal to $$$1$$$ and write $$$2$$$ instead of them; then the board becomes $$$\\\\{2,4\\\\}$$$, Alice cannot make a move, so she wins.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "fb66bf2b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Two players take turns in a game.
