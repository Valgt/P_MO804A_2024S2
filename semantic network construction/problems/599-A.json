Patrick and Shoppingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputToday Patrick waits for a visit from his friend Spongebob. To prepare for the visit, Patrick needs to buy some goodies in two stores located near his house. There is ad1meter long road between his house and the first shop and ad2meter long road between his house and the second shop. Also, there is a road of lengthd3directly connecting these two shops to each other. Help Patrick calculate the minimum distance that he needs to walk in order to go to both shops and return to his house.Patrick always starts at his house. He should visit both shops moving only along the three existing roads and return back to his house. He doesn't mind visiting the same shop or passing the same road multiple times. The only goal is to minimize the total distance traveled.InputThe first line of the input contains three integersd1,d2,d3(1 ≤d1,d2,d3≤ 108) — the lengths of the paths.d1is the length of the path connecting Patrick's house and the first shop;d2is the length of the path connecting Patrick's house and the second shop;d3is the length of the path connecting both shops.OutputPrint the minimum distance that Patrick will have to walk in order to visit both shops and return to his house.ExamplesInput10 20 30Output60Input1 1 5Output4NoteThe first sample is shown on the picture in the problem statement.
