Each character in both string is 'a', 'b' or 'c'.In one move, you can perform one of the following actions:choose an occurrence of \"ab\" in $$$s$$$ and replace it with \"ba\";choose an occurrence of \"bc\" in $$$s$$$ and replace it with \"cb\".You are allowed to perform an arbitrary amount of moves (possibly, zero). Can you change string $$$s$$$ to make it equal to string $$$t$$$?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$.The second line contains string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Each character is 'a', 'b' or 'c'.The third line contains string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Each character is 'a', 'b' or 'c'.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print \"YES\" if you can change string $$$s$$$ to make it equal to string $$$t$$$ by performing an arbitrary amount of moves (possibly, zero).
