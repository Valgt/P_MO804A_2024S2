Bubble Sort Graphtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutIahub recently has learned Bubble Sort, an algorithm that is used to sort a permutation withnelementsa1,a2, ...,anin ascending order. He is bored of this so simple algorithm, so he invents his own graph. The graph (let's call itG) initially hasnvertices and 0 edges. During Bubble Sort execution, edges appear as described in the following algorithm (pseudocode).procedure bubbleSortGraph()build a graph G with n vertices and 0 edgesrepeatswapped = falsefor i = 1 to n - 1 inclusive do:if a[i] > a[i + 1] thenadd an undirected edge in G between a[i] and a[i + 1]swap( a[i], a[i + 1] )swapped = trueend ifend foruntil not swapped/* repeat the algorithm as long as swapped value is true. */end procedureFor a graph, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent (so there are no edges between vertices of an independent set). A maximum independent set is an independent set which has maximum cardinality. Given the permutation, find the size of the maximum independent set of graphG, if we use such permutation as the premutationain procedure bubbleSortGraph.InputThe first line of the input contains an integern(2 ≤n≤ 105).

Bubble sort swaps elements 3 and 1. We add edge (1, 3). Permutation is now [1, 3, 2]. Then bubble sort swaps elements 3 and 2. We add edge (2, 3). Permutation is now sorted. We have a graph with 3 vertices and 2 edges (1, 3) and (2, 3). Its maximal independent set is [1, 2].", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a87709d3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a permutation of $n$ distinct integers ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$).  \n\nBubble Sort is applied to this permutation.  \n\nDuring each pass of Bubble Sort, if two adjacent elements are out of order, an undirected edge is added between them in a graph.  \n\nAfter Bubble Sort completes, find the size of the largest possible set of vertices in the graph where no two vertices are connected by an edge."}, {"prompt_md5": "882364c8", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers.
