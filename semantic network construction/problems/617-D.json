Polylinetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are three points marked on the coordinate plane. The goal is to make a simple polyline, without self-intersections and self-touches, such that it passes through all these points. Also, the polyline must consist of only segments parallel to the coordinate axes. You are to find the minimum number of segments this polyline may consist of.InputEach of the three lines of the input contains two integers. Thei-th line contains integersxiandyi(- 109≤xi,yi≤ 109) — the coordinates of thei-th point.
