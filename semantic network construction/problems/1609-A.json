The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 15)$$$, the number of elements in William's array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le a_i < 16)$$$, the contents of William's array.OutputFor each test case output the maximal sum of array elements after performing an optimal sequence of operations.ExampleInput5 3 6 4 2 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 10 3 2 3 4 15 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8Output50 46 10 26 35184372088846NoteIn the first example test case the optimal sequence would be:Pick $$$i = 2$$$ and $$$j = 1$$$. After performing a sequence of operations $$$a_2 = \\\\frac{4}{2} = 2$$$ and $$$a_1 = 6 \\\\cdot 2 = 12$$$, making the array look as: [12, 2, 2].Pick $$$i = 2$$$ and $$$j = 1$$$. After performing a sequence of operations $$$a_2 = \\\\frac{2}{2} = 1$$$ and $$$a_1 = 12 \\\\cdot 2 = 24$$$, making the array look as: [24, 1, 2].Pick $$$i = 3$$$ and $$$j = 1$$$. After performing a sequence of operations $$$a_3 = \\\\frac{2}{2} = 1$$$ and $$$a_1 = 24 \\\\cdot 2 = 48$$$, making the array look as: [48, 1, 1].The final answer $$$48 + 1 + 1 = 50$$$.In the third example test case there is no way to change the sum of elements, so the answer is $$$10$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "3da27ae0", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
