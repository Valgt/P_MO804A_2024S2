LRUtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWhile creating high loaded systems one should pay a special attention to caching. This problem will be about one of the most popular caching algorithms called LRU (Least Recently Used).Suppose the cache may store no more thankobjects. At the beginning of the workflow the cache is empty. When some object is queried we check if it is present in the cache and move it here if it's not. If there are more thankobjects in the cache after this, the least recently used one should be removed. In other words, we remove the object that has the smallest time of the last query.Consider there arenvideos being stored on the server, all of the same size. Cache can store no more thankvideos and caching algorithm described above is applied. We know that any time a user enters the server he pick the videoiwith probabilitypi. The choice of the video is independent to any events before.The goal of this problem is to count for each of the videos the probability it will be present in the cache after10100queries.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandk(1 ≤k≤n≤ 20) — the number of videos and the size of the cache respectively. Next line containsnreal numberspi(0 ≤pi≤ 1), each of them is given with no more than two digits after decimal point.It's guaranteed that the sum of allpiis equal to1.OutputPrintnreal numbers, thei-th of them should be equal to the probability that thei-th video will be present in the cache after10100queries. You answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed10- 6.Namely: let's assume that your answer isa, and the answer of the jury isb.
