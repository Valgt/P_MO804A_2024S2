Initially, the $$$i$$$-th hero has $$$a_i$$$ health points.The fight in the arena takes place in several rounds. At the beginning of each round, each alive hero deals $$$1$$$ damage to all other heroes. Hits of all heroes occur simultaneously. Heroes whose health is less than $$$1$$$ at the end of the round are considered killed.If exactly $$$1$$$ hero remains alive after a certain round, then he is declared the winner. Otherwise, there is no winner.Your task is to calculate the number of ways to choose the initial health points for each hero $$$a_i$$$, where $$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le x$$$, so that there is no winner of the fight. The number of ways can be very large, so print it modulo $$$998244353$$$. Two ways are considered different if at least one hero has a different amount of health.
