A Tale of Two Landstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe legend of the foundation of Vectorland talks of two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Centuries ago, the array king placed two markers at points $$$|x|$$$ and $$$|y|$$$ on the number line and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Arrayland. Many years later, the vector king placed markers at points $$$|x - y|$$$ and $$$|x + y|$$$ and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Vectorland. He did so in such a way that the land of Arrayland was completely inside (including the endpoints) the land of Vectorland.Here $$$|z|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$z$$$.Now, Jose is stuck on a question of his history exam: \"What are the values of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$?\" Jose doesn't know the answer, but he believes he has narrowed the possible answers down to $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$. Now, he wants to know the number ofunorderedpairs formed by twodifferentelements from these $$$n$$$ integers such that the legend could be true if $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ were equal to these two values. Note that it is possible that Jose is wrong, and that no pairs could possibly make the legend true.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$)  — the number of choices.The second line contains $$$n$$$ pairwise distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the choices Jose is considering.OutputPrint a single integer number — the number of unordered pairs $$$\\\\{x, y\\\\}$$$ formed by different numbers from Jose's choices that could make the legend true.ExamplesInput3 2 5 -3Output2Input2 3 6Output1NoteConsider the first sample. For the pair $$$\\\\{2, 5\\\\}$$$, the situation looks as follows, with the Arrayland markers at $$$|2| = 2$$$ and $$$|5| = 5$$$, while the Vectorland markers are located at $$$|2 - 5| = 3$$$ and $$$|2 + 5| = 7$$$:The legend is not true in this case, because the interval $$$[2, 3]$$$ is not conquered by Vectorland. For the pair $$$\\\\{5, -3\\\\}$$$ the situation looks as follows, with Arrayland consisting of the interval $$$[3, 5]$$$ and Vectorland consisting of the interval $$$[2, 8]$$$:As Vectorland completely contains Arrayland, the legend is true. It can also be shown that the legend is true for the pair $$$\\\\{2, -3\\\\}$$$, for a total of two pairs.In the second sample, the only pair is $$$\\\\{3, 6\\\\}$$$, and the situation looks as follows:Note that even though Arrayland and Vectorland share $$$3$$$ as endpoint, we still consider Arrayland to be completely inside of Vectorland.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "aa3d8340", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
