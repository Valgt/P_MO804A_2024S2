Couple Covertime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputCouple Cover, a wildly popular luck-based game, is about to begin! Two players must work together to construct a rectangle. A bag withnballs, each with an integer written on it, is placed on the table. The first player reaches in and grabs a ball randomly (all balls have equal probability of being chosen) — the number written on this ball is the rectangle's width in meters. This ball is not returned to the bag, and the second player reaches into the bag and grabs another ball — the number written on this ball is the rectangle's height in meters. If the area of the rectangle is greater than or equal some thresholdpsquare meters, the players win. Otherwise, they lose.The organizers of the game are trying to select an appropriate value forpso that the probability of a couple winning is not too high and not too low, but they are slow at counting, so they have hired you to answer some questions for them. You are given a list of the numbers written on the balls, the organizers would like to know how many winning pairs of balls exist for different values ofp. Note that two pairs are different if either the first or the second ball is different between the two in pair, and two different balls with the same number are considered different.InputThe input begins with a single positive integernin its own line (1 ≤n≤ 106).The second line containsnpositive integers — thei-th number in this line is equal toai(1 ≤ai≤ 3·106), the number written on thei-th ball.The next line contains an integerm(1 ≤m≤ 106), the number of questions you are being asked.Then, the following line containsmpositive integers — thej-th number in this line is equal to the value ofp(1 ≤p≤ 3·106) in thej-th question you are being asked.OutputFor each question, print the number of winning pairs of balls that exist for the given value ofpin the separate line.ExamplesInput54 2 6 1 341 3 5 8Output20181410Input25 6230 31Output20", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8295e248", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a bag of $n$ balls, each with a distinct integer written on it.  \n\nTwo players take turns drawing a ball from the bag without replacement.
