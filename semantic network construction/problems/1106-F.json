Lunar New Year and a Recursive Sequencetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLunar New Year is approaching, and Bob received a gift from his friend recently — a recursive sequence!He loves this sequence very much and wants to play with it.Let $$$f_1, f_2, \\\\ldots, f_i, \\\\ldots$$$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers. Bob knows that for $$$i > k$$$, $$$f_i$$$ can be obtained by the following recursive equation:$$$$$$f_i = \\\\left(f_{i - 1} ^ {b_1} \\\\cdot f_{i - 2} ^ {b_2} \\\\cdot \\\\cdots \\\\cdot f_{i - k} ^ {b_k}\\\\right) \\\\bmod p,$$$$$$which in short is$$$$$$f_i = \\\\left(\\\\prod_{j = 1}^{k} f_{i - j}^{b_j}\\\\right) \\\\bmod p,$$$$$$where $$$p = 998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$ (a widely-used prime), $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_k$$$ are known integer constants, and $$$x \\\\bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder of $$$x$$$ divided by $$$y$$$.Bob lost the values of $$$f_1, f_2, \\\\ldots, f_k$$$, which is extremely troublesome – these are the basis of the sequence! Luckily, Bob remembers the first $$$k - 1$$$ elements of the sequence: $$$f_1 = f_2 = \\\\ldots = f_{k - 1} = 1$$$ and the $$$n$$$-th element: $$$f_n = m$$$. Please find any possible value of $$$f_k$$$. If no solution exists, just tell Bob that it is impossible to recover his favorite sequence, regardless of Bob's sadness.InputThe first line contains a positive integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 100$$$), denoting the length of the sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_k$$$.The second line contains $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq b_i < p$$$).The third line contains two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$k < n \\\\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq m < p$$$), which implies $$$f_n = m$$$.OutputOutput a possible value of $$$f_k$$$, where $$$f_k$$$ is a positive integer satisfying $$$1 \\\\leq f_k < p$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If no such $$$f_k$$$ makes $$$f_n = m$$$, output $$$-1$$$ instead.It is easy to show that if there are some possible values of $$$f_k$$$, there must be at least one satisfying $$$1 \\\\leq f_k < p$$$.ExamplesInput3 2 3 5 4 16Output4Input5 4 7 1 5 6 7 14187219Output6Input8 2 3 5 6 1 7 9 10 23333 1Output1Input1 2 88888 66666Output-1Input3 998244352 998244352 998244352 4 2Output-1Input10 283 463 213 777 346 201 463 283 102 999 2333333 6263423Output382480067NoteIn the first sample, we have $$$f_4 = f_3^2 \\\\cdot f_2^3 \\\\cdot f_1^5$$$.
