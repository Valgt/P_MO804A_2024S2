Nodes are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.The graph is consideredharmoniousif and only if the following property holds:For every triple of integers $$$(l, m, r)$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le l < m < r \\\\le n$$$, if there exists apathgoing from node $$$l$$$ to node $$$r$$$, then there exists apathgoing from node $$$l$$$ to node $$$m$$$.In other words, in a harmonious graph, if from a node $$$l$$$ we can reach a node $$$r$$$ through edges ($$$l < r$$$), then we should able to reach nodes $$$(l+1), (l+2), \\\\ldots, (r-1)$$$ too.What is the minimum number of edges we need to add to make the graph harmonious?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 200\\\\ 000$$$ and $$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 200\\\\ 000$$$).The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u_i, v_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$u_i \\\\neq v_i$$$), that mean that there's an edge between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.It is guaranteed that the given graph is simple (there is no self-loop, and there is at most one edge between every pair of nodes).OutputPrint the minimum number of edges we have to add to the graph to make it harmonious.ExamplesInput14 8 1 2 2 7 3 4 6 3 5 7 3 8 6 8 11 12Output1Input200000 3 7 9 9 8 4 5Output0NoteIn the first example, the given graph is not harmonious (for instance, $$$1 < 6 < 7$$$, node $$$1$$$ can reach node $$$7$$$ through the path $$$1 \\\\rightarrow 2 \\\\rightarrow 7$$$, but node $$$1$$$ can't reach node $$$6$$$).
