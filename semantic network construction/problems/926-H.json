Endless Roses Most Beautifultime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputArkady decided to buy roses for his girlfriend.A flower shop has white, orange and red roses, and the total amount of them isn. Arkady thinks that red roses are not good together with white roses, so he won't buy a bouquet containing both red and white roses. Also, Arkady won't buy a bouquet where all roses have the same color.Arkady wants to buy exactlykroses. For each rose in the shop he knows its beauty and color: the beauty of thei-th rose isbi, and its color isci('W' for a white rose, 'O' for an orange rose and 'R' for a red rose).Compute the maximum possible total beauty of a bouquet ofkroses satisfying the constraints above or determine that it is not possible to make such a bouquet.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤k≤n≤ 200 000) — the number of roses in the show and the number of roses Arkady wants to buy.The second line contains a sequence of integersb1,b2, ...,bn(1 ≤bi≤ 10 000), wherebiequals the beauty of thei-th rose.The third line contains a stringcof lengthn, consisting of uppercase English letters 'W', 'O' and 'R', wherecidenotes the color of thei-th rose: 'W' denotes white, 'O'  — orange, 'R' — red.OutputPrint the maximum possible total beauty of a bouquet ofkroses that satisfies the constraints above.
