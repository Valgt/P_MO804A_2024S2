Candiestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecently Vova found $$$n$$$ candy wrappers. He remembers that he bought $$$x$$$ candies during the first day, $$$2x$$$ candies during the second day, $$$4x$$$ candies during the third day, $$$\\\\dots$$$, $$$2^{k-1} x$$$ candies during the $$$k$$$-th day. But there is an issue: Vova remembers neither $$$x$$$ nor $$$k$$$ but he is sure that $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$ are positive integers and $$$k > 1$$$.Vova will be satisfied if you tell himany positiveinteger $$$x$$$ so there is an integer $$$k>1$$$ that $$$x + 2x + 4x + \\\\dots + 2^{k-1} x = n$$$. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.Note that $$$k > 1$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the number of candy wrappers Vova found. It is guaranteed that there is some positive integer $$$x$$$ and integer $$$k>1$$$ that $$$x + 2x + 4x + \\\\dots + 2^{k-1} x = n$$$.OutputPrint one integer —any positiveinteger value of $$$x$$$ so there is an integer $$$k>1$$$ that $$$x + 2x + 4x + \\\\dots + 2^{k-1} x = n$$$.ExampleInput7 3 6 7 21 28 999999999 999999984Output1 2 1 7 4 333333333 333333328NoteIn the first test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $$$x=1, k=2$$$.
