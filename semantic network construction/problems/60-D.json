He had a cunning plan — to destroy all the laughy mushrooms. He knows that the laughy mushrooms can easily burst when they laugh. Mushrooms grow on the lawns. There area[t]mushrooms on thet-th lawn.Misha knows that the lawns where the mushrooms grow have a unique ability. A lawn (say,i) can transfer laugh to other lawn (say,j) if there exists an integer (say,b) such, that some permutation of numbersa[i],a[j]andbis abeautiful triple(i≠j). A beautiful triple is such three pairwise coprime numbersx,y,z, which satisfy the following condition:x2+y2=z2.Misha wants to know on which minimal number of lawns he should laugh for all the laughy mushrooms to burst.InputThe first line contains one integern(1 ≤n≤ 106) which is the number of lawns.
