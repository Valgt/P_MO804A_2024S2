Remove the two numbers from $$$S$$$, and add $$$S_{\\\\text{max}} - S_{\\\\text{min}}$$$ into $$$S$$$.It's easy to show that there will be exactly one number left after $$$n-1$$$ operations. Output that number.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Their description follows.For each test case, one single line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the initial size of the multiset $$$S$$$.OutputFor each test case, output an integer denoting the only number left after $$$n-1$$$ operations.ExampleInput524715177567Output1 2 2 4 33914NoteWe show how the multiset $$$S$$$ changes for $$$n=4$$$.Operation $$$1$$$: $$$S=\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$$$, remove $$$4$$$, $$$1$$$, add $$$3$$$.Operation $$$2$$$: $$$S=\\\\{2,3,3\\\\}$$$, remove $$$3$$$, $$$2$$$, add $$$1$$$.Operation $$$3$$$: $$$S=\\\\{1,3\\\\}$$$, remove $$$3$$$, $$$1$$$, add $$$2$$$.Final: $$$S = \\\\{2\\\\}$$$.Thus, the answer for $$$n = 4$$$ is $$$2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "03138cf4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of numbers from 1 to $n$.
