Kevin and Permutationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor his birthday, Kevin received the set of pairwise distinct numbers $$$1, 2, 3, \\\\ldots, n$$$ as a gift.He is going to arrange these numbers in a way such that the minimum absolute difference between two consecutive numbers be maximum possible. More formally, if he arranges numbers in order $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$, he wants to maximize the value $$$$$$\\\\min \\\\limits_{i=1}^{n - 1} \\\\lvert p_{i + 1} - p_i \\\\rvert,$$$$$$ where $$$|x|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$x$$$.Help Kevin to do that.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\leq 1\\\\,000$$$) — the size of the set.OutputFor each test case print a single line containing $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$) describing the arrangement that maximizes the minimum absolute difference of consecutive elements.Formally, you have to print a permutation $$$p$$$ which maximizes the value $$$\\\\min \\\\limits_{i=1}^{n - 1} \\\\lvert p_{i + 1} - p_i \\\\rvert$$$.If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.ExampleInput243Output2 4 1 3 1 2 3NoteIn the first test case the minimum absolute difference of consecutive elements equals $$$\\\\min \\\\{\\\\lvert 4 - 2 \\\\rvert, \\\\lvert 1 - 4 \\\\rvert, \\\\lvert 3 - 1 \\\\rvert \\\\} = \\\\min \\\\{2, 3, 2\\\\} = 2$$$. It's easy to prove that this answer is optimal.In the second test case each permutation of numbers $$$1, 2, 3$$$ is an optimal answer. The minimum absolute difference of consecutive elements equals to $$$1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "39cd0e4a", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a set of distinct numbers from 1 to n.
