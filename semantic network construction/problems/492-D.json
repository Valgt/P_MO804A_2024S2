Vanya and Computer Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutVanya and his friend Vova play a computer game where they need to destroynmonsters to pass a level. Vanya's character performs attack with frequencyxhits per second and Vova's character performs attack with frequencyyhits per second. Each character spends fixed time to raise a weapon and then he hits (the time to raise the weapon is1 /xseconds for the first character and1 /yseconds for the second one). Thei-th monster dies after he receivesaihits.Vanya and Vova wonder who makes the last hit on each monster. If Vanya and Vova make the last hit at the same time, we assume that both of them have made the last hit.InputThe first line contains three integersn,x,y(1 ≤n≤ 105,1 ≤x,y≤ 106) — the number of monsters, the frequency of Vanya's and Vova's attack, correspondingly.Nextnlines contain integersai(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — the number of hits needed do destroy thei-th monster.OutputPrintnlines. In thei-th line print word \"Vanya\", if the last hit on thei-th monster was performed by Vanya, \"Vova\", if Vova performed the last hit, or \"Both\", if both boys performed it at the same time.ExamplesInput4 3 21234OutputVanyaVovaVanyaBothInput2 1 112OutputBothBothNoteIn the first sample Vanya makes the first hit at time1 / 3, Vova makes the second hit at time1 / 2, Vanya makes the third hit at time2 / 3, and both boys make the fourth and fifth hit simultaneously at the time1.In the second sample Vanya and Vova make the first and second hit simultaneously at time1.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c564e8da", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ monsters.
