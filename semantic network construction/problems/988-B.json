The number of letters in each string is from $$$1$$$ to $$$100$$$, inclusive. Each string consists of lowercase English letters.Some strings might be equal.OutputIf it is impossible to reorder $$$n$$$ given strings in required order, print \"NO\" (without quotes).Otherwise print \"YES\" (without quotes) and $$$n$$$ given strings in required order.ExamplesInput5aabaabacababaabaOutputYESabaabaabaabacabaInput5aabacababaabaababOutputNOInput3qwertyqwertyqwertyOutputYESqwertyqwertyqwertyNoteIn the second example you cannot reorder the strings because the string \"abab\" is not asubstringof the string \"abacaba\".", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d5c27cfb", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ strings.
