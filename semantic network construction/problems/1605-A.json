Deviationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA number $$$a_2$$$ is said to be the arithmetic mean of two numbers $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_3$$$, if the following condition holds: $$$a_1 + a_3 = 2\\\\cdot a_2$$$.We define an arithmetic mean deviation of three numbers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$ as follows: $$$d(a_1, a_2, a_3) = |a_1 + a_3 - 2 \\\\cdot a_2|$$$.Arithmetic means a lot to Jeevan. He has three numbers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$ and he wants to minimize the arithmetic mean deviation $$$d(a_1, a_2, a_3)$$$. To do so, he can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):Choose $$$i, j$$$ from $$$\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}$$$ such that $$$i \\\\ne j$$$ and increment $$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$ and decrement $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$Help Jeevan find out the minimum value of $$$d(a_1, a_2, a_3)$$$ that can be obtained after applying the operation any number of times.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le t \\\\le 5000)$$$  — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le a_1, a_2, a_3 \\\\le 10^{8})$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum value of $$$d(a_1, a_2, a_3)$$$ that can be obtained after applying the operation any number of times.ExampleInput3 3 4 5 2 2 6 1 6 5Output0 1 0NoteNote that after applying a few operations, the values of $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$ may become negative.In the first test case, $$$4$$$ is already the Arithmetic Mean of $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$.$$$d(3, 4, 5) = |3 + 5 - 2 \\\\cdot 4| = 0$$$In the second test case, we can apply the following operation:$$$(2, 2, 6)$$$ $$$\\\\xrightarrow[\\\\text{increment $$$a_2$$$}]{\\\\text{decrement $$$a_1$$$}}$$$ $$$(1, 3, 6)$$$$$$d(1, 3, 6) = |1 + 6 - 2 \\\\cdot 3| = 1$$$It can be proven that answer can not be improved any further.In the third test case, we can apply the following operations:$$$(1, 6, 5)$$$ $$$\\\\xrightarrow[\\\\text{increment $$$a_3$$$}]{\\\\text{decrement $$$a_2$$$}}$$$ $$$(1, 5, 6)$$$ $$$\\\\xrightarrow[\\\\text{increment $$$a_1$$$}]{\\\\text{decrement $$$a_2$$$}}$$$ $$$(2, 4, 6)$$$$$$d(2, 4, 6) = |2 + 6 - 2 \\\\cdot 4| = 0$$$", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "55daa807", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given three integers $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$, you can perform the following operation any number of times:\n\n* Choose two distinct indices $i$ and $j$ from {1, 2, 3}.\n* Increment $a_i$ by 1 and decrement $a_j$ by 1.\n\nThe arithmetic mean deviation of the three numbers is defined as:\n\n$d(a_1, a_2, a_3) = |a_1 + a_3 - 2a_2|$\n\nFind the minimum possible value of $d(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ after performing the operation any number of times.\n\n\nInput:\n\n* The first line contains an integer $t$ (1 ≤ $t$ ≤ 5000), the number of test cases.\n* Each test case contains three integers $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ (1 ≤ $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$ ≤ 10⁸).\n\nOutput:\n\n* For each test case, output the minimum possible value of $d(a_1, a_2, a_3)$."}, {"prompt_md5": "a816de2a", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given three numbers, you can repeatedly increase one number by 1 while decreasing another number by 1.
