Detective Booktime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIvan recently bought a detective book. The book is so interesting that each page of this book introduces some sort of a mystery, which will be explained later. The $$$i$$$-th page contains some mystery that will be explained on page $$$a_i$$$ ($$$a_i \\\\ge i$$$).Ivan wants to read the whole book. Each day, he reads the first page he didn't read earlier, and continues to read the following pages one by one, until all the mysteries he read about are explained and clear to him (Ivan stops if there does not exist any page $$$i$$$ such that Ivan already has read it, but hasn't read page $$$a_i$$$). After that, he closes the book and continues to read it on the following day from the next page.How many days will it take to read the whole book?InputThe first line contains single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of pages in the book.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$i \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the number of page which contains the explanation of the mystery on page $$$i$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the number of days it will take to read the whole book.ExampleInput9 1 3 3 6 7 6 8 8 9Output4NoteExplanation of the example test:During the first day Ivan will read only the first page. During the second day Ivan will read pages number $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$. During the third day — pages $$$4$$$-$$$8$$$. During the fourth (and the last) day Ivan will read remaining page number $$$9$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e73f9139", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ pages in a book.
