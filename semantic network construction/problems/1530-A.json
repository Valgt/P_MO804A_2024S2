Binary Decimaltime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call a number abinary decimalif it's a positive integer and all digits in its decimal notation are either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. For example, $$$1\\\\,010\\\\,111$$$ is a binary decimal, while $$$10\\\\,201$$$ and $$$787\\\\,788$$$ are not.Given a number $$$n$$$, you are asked to represent $$$n$$$ as a sum of some (not necessarily distinct) binary decimals. Compute the smallest number of binary decimals required for that.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$), denoting the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$), denoting the number to be represented.OutputFor each test case, output the smallest number of binary decimals required to represent $$$n$$$ as a sum.ExampleInput3 121 5 1000000000Output2 5 1NoteIn the first test case, $$$121$$$ can be represented as $$$121 = 110 + 11$$$ or $$$121 = 111 + 10$$$.In the second test case, $$$5$$$ can be represented as $$$5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1$$$.In the third test case, $$$1\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000$$$ is a binary decimal itself, thus the answer is $$$1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7140682a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a positive integer $n$.
