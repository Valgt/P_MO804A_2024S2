Array Shrinkingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times:Choose a pair of two neighboring equal elements $$$a_i = a_{i + 1}$$$ (if there is at least one such pair).Replace them by one element with value $$$a_i + 1$$$.After each such operation, the length of the array will decrease by one (and elements are renumerated accordingly). What is the minimum possible length of the array $$$a$$$ you can get?InputThe first line contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 500$$$) — the initial length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 1000$$$) — the initial array $$$a$$$.OutputPrint the only integer — the minimum possible length you can get after performing the operation described above any number of times.ExamplesInput5 4 3 2 2 3Output2Input7 3 3 4 4 4 3 3Output2Input3 1 3 5Output3Input1 1000Output1NoteIn the first test, this is one of the optimal sequences of operations: $$$4$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$2$$$ $$$2$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$5$$$ $$$3$$$.In the second test, this is one of the optimal sequences of operations: $$$3$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$5$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$5$$$ $$$5$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$6$$$ $$$4$$$.In the third and fourth tests, you can't perform the operation at all.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "88df4a56", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
