Petya and Coloringtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLittle Petya loves counting. He wants to count the number of ways to paint a rectangular checkered board of sizen×m(nrows,mcolumns) inkcolors. Besides, the coloring should have the following property: for any vertical line that passes along the grid lines and divides the board in two non-empty parts the number of distinct colors in both these parts should be the same. Help Petya to count these colorings.InputThe first line contains space-separated integersn,mandk(1 ≤n,m≤ 1000, 1 ≤k≤ 106) — the board's vertical and horizontal sizes and the number of colors respectively.OutputPrint the answer to the problem. As the answer can be quite a large number, you should print it modulo109+ 7(1000000007).ExamplesInput2 2 1Output1Input2 2 2Output8Input3 2 2Output40", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "80e55123", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a rectangular grid of size $n \\times m$ and $k$ colors.
