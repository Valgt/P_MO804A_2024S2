For example, string \"010\" has six substrings: \"0\", \"1\", \"0\", \"01\", \"10\", \"010\". Two substrings are considered different if their positions of occurrence are different. So, if some string occurs multiple times, we should consider it the number of times it occurs.You are given a binary strings.
