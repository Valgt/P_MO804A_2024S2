ConstructORtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$d$$$. Your task is to find any integer $$$x$$$ which satisfies all of the following conditions, or determine that no such integers exist:$$$0 \\\\le x \\\\lt 2^{60}$$$;$$$a|x$$$ is divisible by $$$d$$$;$$$b|x$$$ is divisible by $$$d$$$.Here, $$$|$$$ denotes thebitwise OR operation.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line, containing three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a,b,d \\\\lt 2^{30}$$$).OutputFor each test case print one integer. If there exists an integer $$$x$$$ which satisfies all of the conditions from the statement, print $$$x$$$. Otherwise, print $$$-1$$$.If there are multiple solutions, you may printanyof them.ExampleInput812 39 56 8 14100 200 2003 4 62 2 218 27 3420 666 69987654321 123456789 999999999Output18 14 -1 -1 0 11 25599 184470016815529983NoteIn the first test case, $$$x=18$$$ is one of the possible solutions, since $$$39|18=55$$$ and $$$12|18=30$$$, both of which are multiples of $$$d=5$$$.In the second test case, $$$x=14$$$ is one of the possible solutions, since $$$8|14=6|14=14$$$, which is a multiple of $$$d=14$$$.In the third and fourth test cases, we can show that there are no solutions.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "819de746", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given three numbers, a, b, and d.
