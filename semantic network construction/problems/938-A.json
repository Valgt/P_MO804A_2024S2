Word Correctiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVictor tries to write his own text editor, with word correction included. However, the rules of word correction are really strange.Victor thinks that if a word contains twoconsecutivevowels, then it's kinda weird and it needs to be replaced. So the word corrector works in such a way: as long as there are two consecutive vowels in the word, it deletes the first vowel in a word such that there isanother vowel right before it. If there are no two consecutive vowels in the word, it is considered to be correct.You are given a words. Can you predict what will it become after correction?In this problem lettersa,e,i,o,uandyare considered to be vowels.InputThe first line contains one integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of letters in wordsbefore the correction.The second line contains a stringsconsisting of exactlynlowercase Latin letters — the word before the correction.OutputOutput the wordsafter the correction.ExamplesInput5weirdOutputwerdInput4wordOutputwordInput5aaeaaOutputaNoteExplanations of the examples:There is only one replace: weirdwerd;No replace needed since there are no two consecutive vowels;aaeaaaeaaaaaaaa.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "82bdde86", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a word.  \n\nThe word follows these rules:\n\n* If a word has two vowels in a row, remove the first vowel.\n* If a word does not have two vowels in a row, it is considered correct.\n\nGiven a word, output the word after applying these rules.\n\nVowels are: a, e, i, o, u, y."}, {"prompt_md5": "40febd74", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a word, remove the first vowel if it is followed by another vowel.
