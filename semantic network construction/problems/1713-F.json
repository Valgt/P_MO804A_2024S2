Lost Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMy orzlers, we can optimize this problem from $$$O(S^3)$$$ to $$$O\\\\left(T^\\\\frac{5}{9}\\\\right)$$$!â€” Spyofgame, founder of Orzlim religionA long time ago, Spyofgame invented the famous array $$$a$$$ ($$$1$$$-indexed) of length $$$n$$$ that contains information about the world and life. After that, he decided to convert it into the matrix $$$b$$$ ($$$0$$$-indexed) of size $$$(n + 1) \\\\times (n + 1)$$$ which contains information about the world, life and beyond.Spyofgame converted $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$ with the following rules.$$$b_{i,0} = 0$$$ if $$$0 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$;$$$b_{0,i} = a_{i}$$$ if $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$;$$$b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} \\\\oplus b_{i-1,j}$$$ if $$$1 \\\\leq i, j \\\\leq n$$$.Here $$$\\\\oplus$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operation.Today, archaeologists have discovered the famous matrix $$$b$$$. However, many elements of the matrix has been lost. They only know the values of $$$b_{i,n}$$$ for $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$ (note that these are some elements of the lastcolumn, not the lastrow).The archaeologists want to know what a possible array of $$$a$$$ is. Can you help them reconstruct any array that could be $$$a$$$?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, \\\\ldots, b_{n,n}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq b_{i,n} < 2^{30}$$$).OutputIf some array $$$a$$$ is consistent with the information, print a line containing $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$. If there are multiple solutions, output any.If such an array does not exist, output $$$-1$$$ instead.ExamplesInput3 0 2 1Output1 2 3Input1 199633Output199633Input10 346484077 532933626 858787727 369947090 299437981 416813461 865836801 141384800 157794568 691345607Output725081944 922153789 481174947 427448285 516570428 509717938 855104873 280317429 281091129 1050390365NoteIf we let $$$a = [1,2,3]$$$, then $$$b$$$ will be:$$$\\\\bf{0}$$$$$$\\\\bf{1}$$$$$$\\\\bf{2}$$$$$$\\\\bf{3}$$$$$$\\\\bf{0}$$$$$$1$$$$$$3$$$$$$0$$$$$$\\\\bf{0}$$$$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$2$$$$$$\\\\bf{0}$$$$$$1$$$$$$3$$$$$$1$$$The values of $$$b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, \\\\ldots, b_{n,n}$$$ generated are $$$[0,2,1]$$$ which is consistent with what the archaeologists have discovered.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c08445bb", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array $b$ of size $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ where:\n\n* $b_{i,0} = 0$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq n$\n* $b_{0,i} = a_i$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq n$\n* $b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} \\oplus b_{i-1,j}$ for $1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$\n\nHere $\\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.\n\nYou are only given the values of $b_{i,n}$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\nYour task is to find a possible array $a$ that could have produced this matrix $b$.
