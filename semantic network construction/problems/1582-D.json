Vupsen, Pupsen and 0time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVupsen and Pupsen were gifted an integer array. Since Vupsen doesn't like the number $$$0$$$, he threw away all numbers equal to $$$0$$$ from the array. As a result, he got an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.Pupsen, on the contrary, likes the number $$$0$$$ and he got upset when he saw the array without zeroes. To cheer Pupsen up, Vupsen decided to come up with another array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that $$$\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i \\\\cdot b_i=0$$$. Since Vupsen doesn't like number $$$0$$$,the array $$$b$$$ must not contain numbers equal to $$$0$$$. Also, the numbers in that array must not be huge, sothe sum of their absolute values cannot exceed $$$10^9$$$. Please help Vupsen to find any such array $$$b$$$!InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The next $$$2 \\\\cdot t$$$ lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^4 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^4$$$, $$$a_i \\\\neq 0$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n$$$ — elements of the array $$$b$$$ ($$$|b_1|+|b_2|+\\\\ldots +|b_n| \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$b_i \\\\neq 0$$$, $$$\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i \\\\cdot b_i=0$$$).It can be shown that the answer always exists.ExampleInput3 2 5 5 5 5 -2 10 -9 4 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7Output1 -1 -1 5 1 -1 -1 -10 2 2 -3 5 -1 -1NoteIn the first test case, $$$5 \\\\cdot 1 + 5 \\\\cdot (-1)=5-5=0$$$. You could also print $$$3$$$ $$$-3$$$, for example, since $$$5 \\\\cdot 3 + 5 \\\\cdot (-3)=15-15=0$$$In the second test case, $$$5 \\\\cdot (-1) + (-2) \\\\cdot 5 + 10 \\\\cdot 1 + (-9) \\\\cdot (-1) + 4 \\\\cdot (-1)=-5-10+10+9-4=0$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6602a1c9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a$ of length $n$ where all elements are non-zero.
