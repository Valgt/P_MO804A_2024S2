Tenzing and Treetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTenzing has an undirected tree of $$$n$$$ vertices.Define thevalueof a tree with black and white vertices in the following way. Thevalueof an edge is the absolute difference between the number of black nodes in the two components of the tree after deleting the edge. The value of the tree is the sum of values over all edges.For all $$$k$$$ such that $$$0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n$$$, Tenzing wants to know the maximum value of the tree when $$$k$$$ vertices are painted black and $$$n-k$$$ vertices are painted white.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq 5000$$$) — the number of vertices.The following $$$n-1$$$ lines of the input contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq u_i, v_i \\\\leq n, u_i \\\\neq v_i$$$) — indicating an edge between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.OutputOutput $$$n+1$$$ numbers.
