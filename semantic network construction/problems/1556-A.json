A Variety of Operationstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWilliam has two numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ initially both equal tozero. William mastered performing three different operations with them quickly. Before performing each operation some positive integer $$$k$$$ is picked, which is then used to perform one of the following operations: (note, that for each operation you can choose anewpositive integer $$$k$$$)add number $$$k$$$ to both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, oradd number $$$k$$$ to $$$a$$$ and subtract $$$k$$$ from $$$b$$$, oradd number $$$k$$$ to $$$b$$$ and subtract $$$k$$$ from $$$a$$$.Note that after performing operations, numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ may become negative as well.William wants to find out the minimal number of operations he would have to perform to make $$$a$$$ equal to his favorite number $$$c$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal to his second favorite number $$$d$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ $$$(0 \\\\le c, d \\\\le 10^9)$$$, which are William's favorite numbers and which he wants $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ to be transformed into.OutputFor each test case output a single number, which is the minimal number of operations which William would have to perform to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$c$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal to $$$d$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to achieve this using the described operations.ExampleInput6 1 2 3 5 5 3 6 6 8 0 0 0Output-1 2 2 1 2 0NoteLet us demonstrate one of the suboptimal ways of getting a pair $$$(3, 5)$$$:Using an operation of the first type with $$$k=1$$$, the current pair would be equal to $$$(1, 1)$$$.Using an operation of the third type with $$$k=8$$$, the current pair would be equal to $$$(-7, 9)$$$.Using an operation of the second type with $$$k=7$$$, the current pair would be equal to $$$(0, 2)$$$.Using an operation of the first type with $$$k=3$$$, the current pair would be equal to $$$(3, 5)$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2fcf4c49", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two numbers,  $a$ and $b$, initially both equal to 0.
