Also an infinite spiral is painted on the plane. The spiral consists of segments:[(0, 0), (1, 0)],[(1, 0), (1, 1)],[(1, 1), ( - 1, 1)],[( - 1, 1), ( - 1,  - 1)],[( - 1,  - 1), (2,  - 1)],[(2,  - 1), (2, 2)]and so on. Thus, this infinite spiral passes through each integer point of the plane.Valera the horse lives on the plane at coordinates(0, 0). He wants to walk along the spiral to point(x,y).
