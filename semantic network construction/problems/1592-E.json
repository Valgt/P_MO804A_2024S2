Bored Bakrytime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBakry got bored of solving problems related to xor, so he asked you to solve this problem for him.You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers $$$[a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n]$$$.Let's call a subarray $$$a_{l}, a_{l+1}, a_{l+2}, \\\\ldots, a_r$$$goodif $$$a_l \\\\, \\\\& \\\\, a_{l+1} \\\\, \\\\& \\\\, a_{l+2} \\\\, \\\\ldots \\\\, \\\\& \\\\, a_r > a_l \\\\oplus a_{l+1} \\\\oplus a_{l+2} \\\\ldots \\\\oplus a_r$$$, where $$$\\\\oplus$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operationand $$$\\\\&$$$ denotes thebitwise AND operation.Find the length of the longest good subarray of $$$a$$$, or determine that no such subarray exists.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the length of the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$) — elements of the array.OutputPrint a single integer — the length of the longest good subarray.
