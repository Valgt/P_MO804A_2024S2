Strongly Connected Citytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutImagine a city withnhorizontal streets crossingmvertical streets, forming an(n- 1) × (m- 1)grid. In order to increase the traffic flow, mayor of the city has decided to make each street one way. This means in each horizontal street, the traffic moves only from west to east or only from east to west. Also, traffic moves only from north to south or only from south to north in each vertical street. It is possible to enter a horizontal street from a vertical street, or vice versa, at their intersection.The mayor has received some street direction patterns. Your task is to check whether it is possible to reach any junction from any other junction in the proposed street direction pattern.InputThe first line of input contains two integersnandm, (2 ≤n,m≤ 20), denoting the number of horizontal streets and the number of vertical streets.The second line contains a string of lengthn, made of characters '<' and '>', denoting direction of each horizontal street. If thei-th character is equal to '<', the street is directed from east to west otherwise, the street is directed from west to east. Streets are listed in order from north to south.The third line contains a string of lengthm, made of characters '^' and 'v', denoting direction of each vertical street. If thei-th character is equal to '^', the street is directed from south to north, otherwise the street is directed from north to south. Streets are listed in order from west to east.OutputIf the given pattern meets the mayor's criteria, print a single line containing \"YES\", otherwise print a single line containing \"NO\".ExamplesInput3 3><>v^vOutputNOInput4 6<><>v^v^v^OutputYESNoteThe figure above shows street directions in the second sample test case.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "95a6fcf2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "A city has $n$ horizontal streets and $m$ vertical streets, forming a grid.
