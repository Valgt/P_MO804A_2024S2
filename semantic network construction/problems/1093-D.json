Beautiful Graphtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an undirected unweighted graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges.You have to write a number on each vertex of the graph. Each number should be $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ or $$$3$$$. The graph becomes beautiful if for each edge the sum of numbers on vertices connected by this edge is odd.Calculate the number of possible ways to write numbers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ on vertices so the graph becomes beautiful. Since this number may be large, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.Note that you have to write exactly one number on each vertex.The graph does not have any self-loops or multiple edges.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of tests in the input.The first line of each test contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5, 0 \\\\le m \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively. Next $$$m$$$ lines describe edges: $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$ v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u_i, v_i \\\\le n; u_i \\\\neq v_i$$$) — indices of vertices connected by $$$i$$$-th edge.It is guaranteed that $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{t} n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ and $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{t} m \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test print one line, containing one integer — the number of possible ways to write numbers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ on the vertices of given graph so it becomes beautiful.
