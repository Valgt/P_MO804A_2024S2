Vanya and Scalestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVanya has a scales for weighing loads and weights of massesw0,w1,w2, ...,w100grams wherewis some integer not less than2(exactly one weight of each nominal value). Vanya wonders whether he can weight an item with massmusing the given weights, if the weights can be put on both pans of the scales. Formally speaking, your task is to determine whether it is possible to place an item of massmand some weights on the left pan of the scales, and some weights on the right pan of the scales so that the pans of the scales were in balance.InputThe first line contains two integersw,m(2 ≤w≤ 109,1 ≤m≤ 109) — the number defining the masses of the weights and the mass of the item.OutputPrint word 'YES' if the item can be weighted and 'NO' if it cannot.ExamplesInput3 7OutputYESInput100 99OutputYESInput100 50OutputNONoteNote to the first sample test.
