He wants to divide as many candies as possible between all $$$k$$$ kids. Santa can't divide one candy into parts but he is allowed to not use some candies at all.Suppose the kid who recieves the minimum number of candies has $$$a$$$ candies and the kid who recieves the maximum number of candies has $$$b$$$ candies. Then Santa will besatisfied, if the both conditions are met at the same time:$$$b - a \\\\le 1$$$ (it means $$$b = a$$$ or $$$b = a + 1$$$);the number of kids who has $$$a+1$$$ candies (note that $$$a+1$$$ not necessarily equals $$$b$$$) does not exceed $$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{k}{2}\\\\rfloor$$$ (less than or equal to $$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{k}{2}\\\\rfloor$$$).$$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{k}{2}\\\\rfloor$$$ is $$$k$$$ divided by $$$2$$$ and roundeddownto the nearest integer. For example, if $$$k=5$$$ then $$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{k}{2}\\\\rfloor=\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{5}{2}\\\\rfloor=2$$$.Your task is to find the maximum number of candies Santa can give to kids so that he will besatisfied.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases. The $$$i$$$-th test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, k \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the number of candies and the number of kids.OutputFor each test case print the answer on it — the maximum number of candies Santa can give to kids so that he will besatisfied.ExampleInput5 5 2 19 4 12 7 6 2 100000 50010Output5 18 10 6 75015NoteIn the first test case, Santa can give $$$3$$$ and $$$2$$$ candies to kids. There $$$a=2, b=3,a+1=3$$$.In the second test case, Santa can give $$$5, 5, 4$$$ and $$$4$$$ candies. There $$$a=4,b=5,a+1=5$$$. The answer cannot be greater because then the number of kids with $$$5$$$ candies will be $$$3$$$.In the third test case, Santa can distribute candies in the following way: $$$[1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]$$$. There $$$a=1,b=2,a+1=2$$$. He cannot distribute two remaining candies in a way to be satisfied.In the fourth test case, Santa can distribute candies in the following way: $$$[3, 3]$$$. There $$$a=3, b=3, a+1=4$$$. Santa distributed all $$$6$$$ candies.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2df9078a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ candies and need to distribute them among $k$ children.  \n\nThe distribution must satisfy these conditions:\n\n1.
