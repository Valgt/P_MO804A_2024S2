Wonderful Coloring - 2time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis problem is an extension of the problem \"Wonderful Coloring - 1\". It has quite many differences, so you should read this statement completely.Recently, Paul and Mary have found a new favorite sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$. They want to paint it using pieces of chalk of $$$k$$$ colors. The coloring of a sequence is calledwonderfulif the following conditions are met:each element of the sequence is either painted in one of $$$k$$$ colors or isn't painted;each two elements which are painted in the same color are different (i. e. there's no two equal values painted in the same color);let's calculate for each of $$$k$$$ colors the number of elements painted in the color — all calculated numbers must be equal;the total number of painted elements of the sequence is themaximumamong all colorings of the sequence which meet the first three conditions.E. g. consider a sequence $$$a=[3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 3, 10, 10, 2]$$$ and $$$k=3$$$. One of the wonderful colorings of the sequence is shown in the figure.The example of a wonderful coloring of the sequence $$$a=[3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 3, 10, 10, 2]$$$ and $$$k=3$$$. Note that one of the elements isn't painted.Help Paul and Mary to find a wonderful coloring of a given sequence $$$a$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case consists of two lines. The first one contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$) — the length of a given sequence and the number of colors, respectively. The second one contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of them must contain a description of a wonderful coloring for the corresponding test case.Each wonderful coloring must be printed as a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le c_i \\\\le k$$$) separated by spaces where$$$c_i=0$$$, if $$$i$$$-th element isn't painted;$$$c_i>0$$$, if $$$i$$$-th element is painted in the $$$c_i$$$-th color.Remember that you need to maximize the total count of painted elements for the wonderful coloring. If there are multiple solutions, print any one.ExampleInput6 10 3 3 1 1 1 1 10 3 10 10 2 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 13 1 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9 13 2 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9 13 3 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9Output1 1 0 2 3 2 2 1 3 3 4 2 1 3 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 0 2 2 1 1 3 2 1 3 3 1 2 2 3 2 0NoteIn the first test case, the answer is shown in the figure in the statement.
