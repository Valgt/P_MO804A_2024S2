Basil's Gardentime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ flowers in a row, the $$$i$$$-th of them initially has a positive height of $$$h_i$$$ meters.Every second, the wind will blow from the left, causing the height of some flowers to decrease.Specifically, every second, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, in this order, the following happens:If $$$i = n$$$ or $$$h_i > h_{i + 1}$$$, the value of $$$h_i$$$ changes to $$$\\\\max(0, h_i - 1)$$$.How many seconds will pass before $$$h_i=0$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$ for the first time?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of flowers.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\\\ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le h_i \\\\le 10 ^ 9$$$) — the heights of the flowers.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of seconds that will pass before $$$h_i=0$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$.ExampleInput431 1 223 11957 4 4 3 2Output4 3 9 7NoteIn the first test case, the flower heights change as follows: $$$[1, 1, 2] \\\\rightarrow [1, 1, 1] \\\\rightarrow [1, 1, 0] \\\\rightarrow [1, 0, 0] \\\\rightarrow [0, 0, 0]$$$.In the second test case, the flower heights change as follows: $$$[3, 1] \\\\rightarrow [2, 0] \\\\rightarrow [1, 0] \\\\rightarrow [0, 0]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6f54ffe8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of positive integers representing the heights of $n$ flowers.
