Vasya and Golden Tickettime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $$$n$$$ digits $$$a_1a_2\\\\dots a_n$$$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $$$350178$$$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $$$350$$$, $$$17$$$ and $$$8$$$: $$$3+5+0=1+7=8$$$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong toexactlyone segment.Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of digits in the ticket.The second line contains $$$n$$$ digits $$$a_1 a_2 \\\\dots a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 9$$$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.OutputIf the golden ticket is lucky then print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (both case insensitive).ExamplesInput573452OutputYESInput41248OutputNONoteIn the first example the ticket can be divided into $$$7$$$, $$$34$$$ and $$$52$$$: $$$7=3+4=5+2$$$.In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "063a9599", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of digits.
