Luckily, you can help them out by uploading some of your RAM!You want to upload $$$n$$$ GBs of RAM. Every second, you will upload either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ GB of RAM. However, there is a restriction on your network speed: in any $$$k$$$ consecutive seconds, you can upload only at most $$$1$$$ GB of RAM in total.Find the minimum number of seconds needed to upload $$$n$$$ GBs of RAM!InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, k \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of GBs that you want to upload and the length of the time window respectively.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of seconds needed to upload $$$n$$$ GBs of RAM.ExampleInput65 12 22 31 711 5100 100Output5 3 4 1 51 9901NoteIn the first test case, you can upload $$$1$$$ GB of RAM per second, so to upload $$$5$$$ GBs, you need $$$5$$$ seconds.In the second test case, you can upload $$$1$$$ GB in the first second, $$$0$$$ GBs in the second second, and $$$1$$$ GB in the third second, which in total adds up to exactly $$$2$$$ GBs of uploaded RAM.In the third test case, you can upload $$$1$$$ GB in the first second, $$$0$$$ GBs in the second second, $$$0$$$ GBs in the third second, and $$$1$$$ GB in the fourth second, which in total adds up to exactly $$$2$$$ GBs of uploaded RAM.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e2bdc759", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You need to upload $n$ GB of RAM.
