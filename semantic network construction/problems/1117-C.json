Magic Shiptime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou a captain of a ship. Initially you are standing in a point $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ (obviously, all positions in the sea can be described by cartesian plane) and you want to travel to a point $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$.You know the weather forecast — the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of lettersU,D,LandR. The letter corresponds to a direction of wind. Moreover, the forecast is periodic, e.g. the first day wind blows to the side $$$s_1$$$, the second day — $$$s_2$$$, the $$$n$$$-th day — $$$s_n$$$ and $$$(n+1)$$$-th day — $$$s_1$$$ again and so on.Ship coordinates change the following way:if wind blows the directionU, then the ship moves from $$$(x, y)$$$ to $$$(x, y + 1)$$$;if wind blows the directionD, then the ship moves from $$$(x, y)$$$ to $$$(x, y - 1)$$$;if wind blows the directionL, then the ship moves from $$$(x, y)$$$ to $$$(x - 1, y)$$$;if wind blows the directionR, then the ship moves from $$$(x, y)$$$ to $$$(x + 1, y)$$$.The ship can also either go one of the four directions or stay in place each day. If it goes then it's exactly 1 unit of distance. Transpositions of the ship and the wind add up. If the ship stays in place, then only the direction of wind counts. For example, if wind blows the directionUand the ship moves the directionL, then from point $$$(x, y)$$$ it will move to the point $$$(x - 1, y + 1)$$$, and if it goes the directionU, then it will move to the point $$$(x, y + 2)$$$.You task is to determine the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the point $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$x_1, y_1$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le x_1, y_1 \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the initial coordinates of the ship.The second line contains two integers $$$x_2, y_2$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le x_2, y_2 \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the coordinates of the destination point.It is guaranteed that the initial coordinates and destination point coordinates are different.The third line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.The fourth line contains the string $$$s$$$ itself, consisting only of lettersU,D,LandR.OutputThe only line should contain the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the point $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$.If it's impossible then print \"-1\".ExamplesInput0 0 4 6 3 UUUOutput5Input0 3 0 0 3 UDDOutput3Input0 0 0 1 1 LOutput-1NoteIn the first example the ship should perform the following sequence of moves: \"RRRRU\".

Then its coordinates will change accordingly: $$$(0, 3)$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$(0, 3)$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$(0, 1)$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$(0, 0)$$$.In the third example the ship can never reach the point $$$(0, 1)$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b9bb0094", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a starting point $(x_1, y_1)$ and a destination point $(x_2, y_2)$ on a 2D plane.
