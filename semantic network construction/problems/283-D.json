Cows and Cool Sequencestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutBessie and the cows have recently been playing with \"cool\" sequences and are trying to construct some. Unfortunately they are bad at arithmetic, so they need your help!A pair(x,y)of positive integers is \"cool\" ifxcan be expressed as the sum ofyconsecutive integers (not necessarily positive). A sequence(a1,a2, ...,an)is \"cool\" if the pairs(a1,a2), (a2,a3), ..., (an- 1,an)are all cool.The cows have a sequence ofnpositive integers,a1,a2, ...,an. In one move, they may replace someaiwith any other positive integer (there are no other limits on the new value ofai). Determine the smallest number of moves needed to make the resulting sequence cool.InputThe first line contains a single integer,n(2 ≤n≤ 5000). The next line containsnspace-separated integers,a1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 1015).Please do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.OutputA single integer, the minimum number ofaithat must be changed to make the sequence cool.ExamplesInput36 4 1Output0Input420 6 3 4Output2NoteIn the first sample, the sequence is already cool, so we don't need to change any elements. In the second sample, we can changea2to 5 anda3to 10 to make (20, 5, 10, 4) which is cool.
