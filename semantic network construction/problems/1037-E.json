Tripstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ persons who initially don't know each other. On each morning, two of them, who were not friends before, become friends.We want to plan a trip for every evening of $$$m$$$ days. On each trip, you have to select a group of people that will go on the trip. For every person, one of the following should hold:Either this person does not go on the trip,Or at least $$$k$$$ of his friends also go on the trip.Note that the friendship is not transitive. That is, if $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are friends and $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ are friends, it does not necessarily imply that $$$a$$$ and $$$c$$$ are friends.For each day, find the maximum number of people that can go on the trip on that day.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5, 1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k < n$$$) — the number of people, the number of days and the number of friends each person on the trip should have in the group.The $$$i$$$-th ($$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq m$$$) of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq x, y\\\\leq n$$$, $$$x\\\\ne y$$$), meaning that persons $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ become friends on the morning of day $$$i$$$.
