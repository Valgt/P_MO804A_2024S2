A-B Palindrometime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of the characters '0', '1', and '?'. You need to replace all the characters with '?' in the string $$$s$$$ by '0' or '1' so that the string becomes a palindrome and hasexactly$$$a$$$ characters '0' andexactly$$$b$$$ characters '1'. Note that each of the characters '?' is replacedindependentlyfrom the others.A string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is called a palindrome if the equality $$$t[i] = t[n-i+1]$$$ is true for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$).For example, if $$$s=$$$\"01?????0\", $$$a=4$$$ and $$$b=4$$$, then you can replace the characters '?' in the following ways:\"01011010\";\"01100110\".For the given string $$$s$$$ and the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, replace all the characters with '?' in the string $$$s$$$ by '0' or '1' so that the string becomes a palindrome and hasexactly$$$a$$$ characters '0' andexactly$$$b$$$ characters '1'.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$a + b \\\\ge 1$$$).The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$a+b$$$, consisting of the characters '0', '1', and '?'.It is guaranteed that the sum of the string lengths of $$$s$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output:\"-1\", if you can't replace all the characters '?' in the string $$$s$$$ by '0' or '1' so that the string becomes a palindrome and that it containsexactly$$$a$$$ characters '0' andexactly$$$b$$$ characters '1';the string that is obtained as a result of the replacement, otherwise.If there are several suitable ways to replace characters, you can output any.ExampleInput9 4 4 01?????0 3 3 ?????? 1 0 ? 2 2 0101 2 2 01?0 0 1 0 0 3 1?1 2 2 ?00? 4 3 ??010?0Output01011010 -1 0 -1 0110 -1 111 1001 0101010", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0d045eef", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a string with '0', '1', and '?'.
