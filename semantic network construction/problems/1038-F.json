For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considereddifferentcyclical strings.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 40$$$) — the length of the target string $$$t$$$.The next line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le n$$$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $$$t$$$.
