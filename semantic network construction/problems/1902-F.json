Trees and XOR Queries Againtime limit per test6.5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. There is an integer written on each vertex; the $$$i$$$-th vertex has integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it.You have to process $$$q$$$ queries. The $$$i$$$-th query consists of three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ and $$$k_i$$$. For this query, you have to answer if it is possible to choose a set of vertices $$$v_1, v_2, \\\\dots, v_m$$$ (possibly empty) such that:every vertex $$$v_j$$$ is on the simple path between $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ (endpoints can be used as well);$$$a_{v_1} \\\\oplus a_{v_2} \\\\oplus \\\\dots \\\\oplus a_{v_m} = k_i$$$, where $$$\\\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operator.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2^{20} - 1$$$).Then $$$n-1$$$ lines follow. Each of them contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u, v \\\\le n$$$; $$$u \\\\ne v$$$) denoting an edge of the tree.The next line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the number of queries.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow.
