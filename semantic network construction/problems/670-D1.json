Magic Powder - 1time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis problem is given in two versions that differ only by constraints. If you can solve this problem in large constraints, then you can just write a single solution to the both versions. If you find the problem too difficult in large constraints, you can write solution to the simplified version only.Waking up in the morning, Apollinaria decided to bake cookies. To bake one cookie, she needsningredients, and for each ingredient she knows the valueai— how many grams of this ingredient one needs to bake a cookie. To prepare one cookie Apollinaria needs to use allningredients.Apollinaria hasbigram of thei-th ingredient. Also she haskgrams of a magic powder. Each gram of magic powder can be turned to exactly1gram of any of theningredients and can be used for baking cookies.Your task is to determine the maximum number of cookies, which Apollinaria is able to bake using the ingredients that she has and the magic powder.InputThe first line of the input contains two positive integersnandk(1 ≤n,k≤ 1000) — the number of ingredients and the number of grams of the magic powder.The second line contains the sequencea1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 1000), where thei-th number is equal to the number of grams of thei-th ingredient, needed to bake one cookie.The third line contains the sequenceb1,b2, ...,bn(1 ≤bi≤ 1000), where thei-th number is equal to the number of grams of thei-th ingredient, which Apollinaria has.OutputPrint the maximum number of cookies, which Apollinaria will be able to bake using the ingredients that she has and the magic powder.ExamplesInput3 12 1 411 3 16Output4Input4 34 3 5 611 12 14 20Output3NoteIn the first sample it is profitably for Apollinaria to make the existing1gram of her magic powder to ingredient with the index2, then Apollinaria will be able to bake4cookies.In the second sample Apollinaria should turn1gram of magic powder to ingredient with the index1and1gram of magic powder to ingredient with the index3. Then Apollinaria will be able to bake3cookies. The remaining1gram of the magic powder can be left, because it can't be used to increase the answer.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "62e7f1a9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ ingredients needed to bake cookies.
