Circle of Studentstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ students standing in a circle in some order. The index of the $$$i$$$-th student is $$$p_i$$$. It is guaranteed that all indices of students are distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (i. e. they form a permutation).Students want to start a round dance. Aclockwiseround dance can be started if the student $$$2$$$ comes right after the student $$$1$$$ in clockwise order (there are no students between them), the student $$$3$$$ comes right after the student $$$2$$$ in clockwise order, and so on, and the student $$$n$$$ comes right after the student $$$n - 1$$$ in clockwise order. Acounterclockwiseround dance is almost the same thing — the only difference is that the student $$$i$$$ should be right after the student $$$i - 1$$$ in counterclockwise order (this condition should be met for every $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$n$$$).For example, if the indices of students listed in clockwise order are $$$[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]$$$, then they can start a clockwise round dance. If the students have indices $$$[3, 2, 1, 4]$$$ in clockwise order, then they can start a counterclockwise round dance.Your task is to determine whether it is possible to start a round dance. Note that the students cannot change their positions before starting the dance; they cannot swap or leave the circle, and no other student can enter the circle.You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 200$$$) — the number of queries. Then $$$q$$$ queries follow.The first line of the query contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 200$$$) — the number of students.The second line of the query contains a permutation of indices $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is the index of the $$$i$$$-th student (in clockwise order). It is guaranteed that all $$$p_i$$$ are distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (i. e. they form a permutation).OutputFor each query, print the answer on it. If a round dance can be started with the given order of students, print \"YES\". Otherwise print \"NO\".ExampleInput5 4 1 2 3 4 3 1 3 2 5 1 2 3 5 4 1 1 5 3 2 1 5 4OutputYES YES NO YES YES", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "95693288", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a circle of $n$ students, where each student has a unique index from 1 to $n$.
