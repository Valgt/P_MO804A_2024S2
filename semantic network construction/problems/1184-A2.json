Heidi Learns Hashing (Medium)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAfter learning about polynomial hashing, Heidi decided to learn about shift-xor hashing. In particular, she came across this interesting problem.Given a bitstring $$$y \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\}^n$$$ find out the number of different $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq k < n$$$) such that there exists $$$x \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\}^n$$$ for which $$$y = x \\\\oplus \\\\mbox{shift}^k(x).$$$In the above, $$$\\\\oplus$$$ is the xor operation and $$$\\\\mbox{shift}^k$$$ is the operation of shifting a bitstring cyclically to the right $$$k$$$ times. For example, $$$001 \\\\oplus 111 = 110$$$ and $$$\\\\mbox{shift}^3(00010010111000) = 00000010010111$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$), the length of the bitstring $$$y$$$.The second line contains the bitstring $$$y$$$.OutputOutput a single integer: the number of suitable values of $$$k$$$.ExampleInput4 1010Output3NoteIn the first example:$$$1100\\\\oplus \\\\mbox{shift}^1(1100) = 1010$$$$$$1000\\\\oplus \\\\mbox{shift}^2(1000) = 1010$$$$$$0110\\\\oplus \\\\mbox{shift}^3(0110) = 1010$$$There is no $$$x$$$ such that $$$x \\\\oplus x = 1010$$$, hence the answer is $$$3$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ed60f71d", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a sequence of 0s and 1s, find the number of positions you can shift the sequence to the right so that the shifted sequence XORed with the original sequence results in the given sequence."}, {"prompt_md5": "8561415f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a binary string $y$ of length $n$, find the number of integers $k$ ($0 \\leq k < n$) such that there exists a binary string $x$ of length $n$ where:\n\n$y = x \\oplus \\text{shift}^k(x)$\n\nHere, $\\oplus$ represents the bitwise XOR operation, and $\\text{shift}^k(x)$ represents the cyclic right shift of the string $x$ by $k$ positions. \n\n\nFor example, if $y = 1010$, the possible values of $k$ are 1, 2, and 3."}]}
