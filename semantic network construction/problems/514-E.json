Darth Vader and Treetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutWhen Darth Vader gets bored, he sits down on the sofa, closes his eyes and thinks of an infinite rooted tree where each node has exactlynsons, at that for each node, the distance between it an itsi-th left child equals todi. The Sith Lord loves counting the number of nodes in the tree that are at a distance at mostxfrom the root. The distance is the sum of the lengths of edges on the path between nodes.But he has got used to this activity and even grew bored of it. 'Why does he do that, then?' — you may ask. It's just that he feels superior knowing that only he can solve this problem.Do you want to challenge Darth Vader himself? Count the required number of nodes. As the answer can be rather large, find it modulo109+ 7.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandx(1 ≤n≤ 105, 0 ≤x≤ 109) — the number of children of each node and the distance from the root within the range of which you need to count the nodes.The next line containsnspace-separated integersdi(1 ≤di≤ 100) — the length of the edge that connects each node with itsi-th child.OutputPrint a single number — the number of vertexes in the tree at distance from the root equal to at mostx.ExamplesInput3 31 2 3Output8NotePictures to the sample (the yellow color marks the nodes the distance to which is at most three)", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4a68b883", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a rooted tree where each node has $n$ children and the distance between a node and its $i$-th left child is $d_i$, find the number of nodes in the tree that are at a distance of at most $x$ from the root.
