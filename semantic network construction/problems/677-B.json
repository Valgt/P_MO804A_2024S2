At the end of the second there is only amount of height2remaining inside.Now Vanya puts the piece of potato of height4. At the end of the second there is amount of height3remaining.Vanya puts the piece of height3inside and again there are only3centimeters remaining at the end of this second.Vanya finally puts the pieces of height2and1inside. At the end of the second the height of potato in the processor is equal to3.During this second processor finally smashes all the remaining potato and the process finishes.In the second sample, Vanya puts the piece of height5inside and waits for2seconds while it is completely smashed. Then he repeats the same process for4other pieces. The total time is equal to2·5 = 10seconds.In the third sample, Vanya simply puts all the potato inside the processor and waits2seconds.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ba284cba", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a food processor with a maximum height of $h$ and a smashing power of $k$ centimeters per second.
