For simplicity, we call their kindpollywogs. Dart andx- 1other pollywogs are playing a game. There arenstones in a row, numbered from1throughnfrom left to right. At most1pollywog may be sitting on each stone at a time. Initially, the pollywogs are sitting on the firstxstones (one pollywog on each stone).Dart and his friends want to end up on the lastxstones. At each second, the leftmost pollywog should jump to the right. A pollywog can jump at mostkstones; more specifically, a pollywog can jump from stone numberito stonesi+ 1,i+ 2, ...i+k.
