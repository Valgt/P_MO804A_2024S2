Can you help her?If there are many answers print any. We can show that answer always exists for the given constraints.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of elements in the list $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 50$$$) — the elements of $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100$$$.OutputFor each test case:Output $$$n+1$$$ lines. In the $$$i$$$-th line print string $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s_i| \\\\le 200$$$),consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Length of the longest common prefix of strings $$$s_i$$$ and $$$s_{i+1}$$$ has to be equal to $$$a_i$$$.If there are many answers print any.
