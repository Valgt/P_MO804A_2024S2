He thinks it's particularly funny to create two new words by swapping the first character of $$$a$$$ with the first character of $$$b$$$. He wants you to output $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ after the swap.Note that the new words may not necessarily be different.InputThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$)  — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$3$$$. The strings only contain lowercase Latin letters.OutputFor each test case, after the swap, output $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, separated by a space.ExampleInput6bit setcat doghot doguwu owocat catzzz zzzOutputsit bet dat cog dot hog owu uwo cat cat zzz zzz", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1f842df0", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $t$ pairs of 3-letter strings.
