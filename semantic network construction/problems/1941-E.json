Rudolf and k Bridgestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his friend solve this problem.The river is a grid of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. The intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column contains the number $$$a_{i,j}$$$ — the depth in the corresponding cell. All cells in thefirstandlastcolumns correspond to the river banks, so the depth for them is $$$0$$$.The river may look like this.Rudolf can choose the row $$$(i,1), (i,2), \\\\ldots, (i,m)$$$ and build a bridge over it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost of installing a support in the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ is $$$a_{i,j}+1$$$. Supports must be installed so that the following conditions are met:A support must be installed in cell $$$(i,1)$$$;A support must be installed in cell $$$(i,m)$$$;The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must beno more than$$$d$$$. The distance between supports $$$(i, j_1)$$$ and $$$(i, j_2)$$$ is $$$|j_1 - j_2| - 1$$$.Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build $$$k$$$ bridges onconsecutiverows of the river, that is, to choose some $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n - k + 1$$$) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows $$$i, i + 1, \\\\ldots, i + k - 1$$$. Help Rudolfminimizethe total cost of installing supports.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3)$$$ — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$, $$$3 \\\\le m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le d \\\\le m$$$) — the number of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports.Then follow $$$n$$$ lines, $$$i$$$-th line contains $$$m$$$ positive integers $$$a_{i, j}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_{i, j} \\\\le 10^6$$$, $$$a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0$$$) — the depths of the river cells.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\\\cdot m$$$ for all sets of input data does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of supports installation.ExampleInput53 11 1 40 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 00 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 00 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 04 4 2 10 3 3 00 2 1 00 1 2 00 3 3 04 5 2 50 1 1 1 00 2 2 2 00 2 1 1 00 3 2 1 01 8 1 10 10 4 8 4 4 2 04 5 3 20 8 4 4 00 3 4 8 00 8 1 10 00 10 1 5 0Output4 8 4 15 14NoteIn the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second row.It is not a top view, butside view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river bottom.In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells $$$(2, 3)$$$, $$$(3, 2)$$$, and on the river banks.In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b6ed8070", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a grid of size $n \\times m$ representing a river.
