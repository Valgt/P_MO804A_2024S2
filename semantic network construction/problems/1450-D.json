Rating Compressiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOn the competitive programming platform CodeCook, every person has a rating graph described by an array of integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You are now updating the infrastructure, so you've created a program to compress these graphs.The program works as follows. Given an integer parameter $$$k$$$, the program takes the minimum of each contiguous subarray of length $$$k$$$ in $$$a$$$.More formally, for an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$, define the $$$k$$$-compression array of $$$a$$$ as an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n-k+1$$$, such that $$$$$$b_j =\\\\min_{j\\\\le i\\\\le j+k-1}a_i$$$$$$For example, the $$$3$$$-compression array of $$$[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]$$$ is $$$[\\\\min\\\\{1, 3, 4\\\\}, \\\\min\\\\{3, 4, 5\\\\}, \\\\min\\\\{4, 5, 2\\\\}]=[1, 3, 2].$$$A permutation of length $$$m$$$ is an array consisting of $$$m$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$m=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).A $$$k$$$-compression array will make CodeCook users happy if it will be a permutation. Given an array $$$a$$$, determine for all $$$1\\\\leq k\\\\leq n$$$ if CodeCook users will be happy after a $$$k$$$-compression of this array or not.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t\\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq 3\\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line of the description of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq a_i\\\\leq n$$$) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed, that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$3\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a binary string of length $$$n$$$.The $$$k$$$-th character of the string should be $$$1$$$ if CodeCook users will be happy after a $$$k$$$-compression of the array $$$a$$$, and $$$0$$$ otherwise.ExampleInput5 5 1 5 3 4 2 4 1 3 2 1 5 1 3 3 3 2 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 3 3 3 2Output10111 0001 00111 1111111111 000NoteIn the first test case, $$$a=[1, 5, 3, 4, 2]$$$.The $$$1$$$-compression of $$$a$$$ is $$$[1, 5, 3, 4, 2]$$$ and it is a permutation.The $$$2$$$-compression of $$$a$$$ is $$$[1, 3, 3, 2]$$$ and it is not a permutation, since $$$3$$$ appears twice.The $$$3$$$-compression of $$$a$$$ is $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$ and it is a permutation.The $$$4$$$-compression of $$$a$$$ is $$$[1, 2]$$$ and it is a permutation.The $$$5$$$-compression of $$$a$$$ is $$$[1]$$$ and it is a permutation.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "fe5767ee", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a$ of length $n$.
