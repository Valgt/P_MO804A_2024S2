Divide and Sumtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$2n$$$. Consider a partition of array $$$a$$$ into two subsequences $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ of length $$$n$$$ each (each element of array $$$a$$$ should be in exactly one subsequence: either in $$$p$$$ or in $$$q$$$).Let's sort $$$p$$$ in non-decreasing order, and $$$q$$$ in non-increasing order, we can denote the sorted versions by $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, respectively. Then thecostof a partition is defined as $$$f(p, q) = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n |x_i - y_i|$$$.Find the sum of $$$f(p, q)$$$ over all correct partitions of array $$$a$$$.
