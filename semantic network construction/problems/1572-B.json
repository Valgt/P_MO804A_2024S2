Xor of 3time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of $$$0$$$s and $$$1$$$s.You can perform the following operation on this sequence:Pick an index $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-2$$$ (inclusive).Change all of $$$a_{i}$$$, $$$a_{i+1}$$$, $$$a_{i+2}$$$ to $$$a_{i} \\\\oplus a_{i+1} \\\\oplus a_{i+2}$$$ simultaneously, where $$$\\\\oplus$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operationFind a sequence ofat most$$$n$$$ operations that changes all elements of $$$a$$$ to $$$0$$$s or report that it's impossible.We can prove that if there exists a sequence of operations of any length that changes all elements of $$$a$$$ to $$$0$$$s, then there is also such a sequence of length not greater than $$$n$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$).The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i = 0$$$ or $$$a_i = 1$$$) — elements of $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, do the following:if there is no way of making all the elements of $$$a$$$ equal to $$$0$$$ after performing the above operation some number of times, print \"NO\".otherwise, in the first line print \"YES\", in the second line print $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$) — the number of operations that you want to perform on $$$a$$$, and in the third line print a sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le n - 2$$$) — the indices on which the operation should be applied.If there are multiple solutions, you may print any.ExampleInput3 3 0 0 0 5 1 1 1 1 0 4 1 0 0 1OutputYES 0 YES 2 3 1 NONoteIn the first example, the sequence contains only $$$0$$$s so we don't need to change anything.In the second example, we can transform $$$[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]$$$ to $$$[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]$$$ and then to $$$[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ by performing the operation on the third element of $$$a$$$ and then on the first element of $$$a$$$.In the third example, no matter whether we first perform the operation on the first or on the second element of $$$a$$$ we will get $$$[1, 1, 1, 1]$$$, which cannot be transformed to $$$[0, 0, 0, 0]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4779a197", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of 0s and 1s.
