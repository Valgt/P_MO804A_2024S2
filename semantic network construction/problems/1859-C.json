That's why he came up with a strange problem about permutations$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$ and asks you to solve it. Can you do it?Let's call thecostof a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ the value of the expression:$$$(\\\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} p_i \\\\cdot i) - (\\\\max_{j = 1}^{n} p_j \\\\cdot j)$$$.Find the maximum cost among all permutations of length $$$n$$$.$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 30$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 250$$$) — the length of the permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum cost among all permutations of length $$$n$$$.ExampleInput52431020Output2 17 7 303 2529NoteIn the first test case, the permutation with the maximum cost is $$$[2, 1]$$$. The cost is equal to $$$2 \\\\cdot 1 + 1 \\\\cdot 2 - \\\\max (2 \\\\cdot 1, 1 \\\\cdot 2)= 2 + 2 - 2 = 2$$$.In the second test case, the permutation with the maximum cost is $$$[1, 2, 4, 3]$$$.
