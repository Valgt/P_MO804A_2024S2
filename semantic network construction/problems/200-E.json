Tractor Collegetime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutWhile most students still sit their exams, the tractor college has completed the summer exam session. In fact, students study only one subject at this college — the Art of Operating a Tractor. Therefore, at the end of a term a student gets only one mark, a three (satisfactory), a four (good) or a five (excellent). Those who score lower marks are unfortunately expelled.The college hasnstudents, and oddly enough, each of them can be on scholarship. The size of the scholarships varies each term. Since the end-of-the-term exam has just ended, it's time to determine the size of the scholarship to the end of next term.The monthly budget for the scholarships of the Tractor college issrubles. To distribute the budget optimally, you must follow these rules:The students who received the same mark for the exam, should receive the same scholarship;Let us denote the size of the scholarship (in roubles) for students who have received marks3,4and5for the exam, ask3,k4andk5, respectively. The valuesk3,k4andk5must be integers and satisfy the inequalities0 ≤k3≤k4≤k5;Let's assume thatc3,c4,c5show how many students received marks3,4and5for the exam, respectively. The budget of the scholarship should be fully spent on them, that is,c3·k3+c4·k4+c5·k5=s;Let's introduce function— the value that shows how well the scholarships are distributed between students. In the optimal distribution functionf(k3,k4,k5)takes theminimumpossible value.Given the results of the exam, and the budget sizes, you have to find the optimal distribution of the scholarship.InputThe first line has two integersn,s(3 ≤n≤ 300, 1 ≤s≤ 3·105) — the number of students and the budget size for the scholarship, respectively. The second line containsnintegers, where thei-th number represents the mark that thei-th student got for the exam. It is guaranteed that at each mark was given to at least one student.OutputOn a single line print three integersk3,k4andk5— the sought values that represent the optimal distribution of the scholarships. If there are multiple optimal answers, print any of them. If there is no answer, print -1.ExamplesInput5 113 4 3 5 5Output1 3 3Input6 155 3 3 4 4 5Output-1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9a2c1043", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ students and a budget of $s$ rubles to distribute as scholarships.
