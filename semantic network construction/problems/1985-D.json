Manhattan Circletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven a $$$n$$$ by $$$m$$$ grid consisting of '.' and '#' characters, there exists a whole manhattan circle on the grid. The top left corner of the grid has coordinates $$$(1,1)$$$, and the bottom right corner has coordinates $$$(n, m)$$$.Point ($$$a, b$$$) belongs to the manhattan circle centered at ($$$h, k$$$) if $$$|h - a| + |k - b| < r$$$, where $$$r$$$ is a positive constant.On the grid, the set of points that are part of the manhattan circle is marked as '#'. Find the coordinates of the center of the circle.InputThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$)  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the height and width of the grid, respectively.The next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ characters '.' or '#'. If the character is '#', then the point is part of the manhattan circle.It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n \\\\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, and there is a whole manhattan circle on the grid.OutputFor each test case, output the two integers, the coordinates of the center of the circle.ExampleInput65 5............#............5 5..#...###.#####.###...#..5 6.............#....###....#....1 1#5 6...#....###..#####..###....#..2 10.............#......Output3 3 3 3 4 2 1 1 3 4 2 4", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2c4bf221", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a grid of size $n \\times m$ filled with '.' and '#' characters.
