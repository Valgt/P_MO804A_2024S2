Yui and Mahjong Settime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problem.Yui is a girl who enjoys playing Mahjong.She has a mysterious set which consists of tiles (this set can be empty). Each tile has an integer value between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, andat most $$$n$$$ tilesin the set have the same value. So the set can contain at most $$$n^2$$$ tiles.You want to figure out which values are on the tiles. But Yui is shy, she prefers to play a guessing game with you.Let's call a set consisting ofthreetilestripletif their values are the same. For example, $$$\\\\{2,\\\\,2,\\\\,2\\\\}$$$ is a triplet, but $$$\\\\{2,\\\\,3,\\\\,3\\\\}$$$ is not.Let's call a set consisting ofthreetilesstraightif their values are consecutive integers. For example, $$$\\\\{2,\\\\,3,\\\\,4\\\\}$$$ is a straight, but $$$\\\\{1,\\\\,3,\\\\,5\\\\}$$$ is not.At first, Yui gives you the number of triplet subsets and straight subsets of the initial set respectively. After that, you can insert a tile with an integer value between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ into the setat most $$$n$$$ times. Every time you insert a tile, you will get the number of triplet subsets and straight subsets of the current set as well.Note that two tiles with the same value are treated different. In other words, in the set $$$\\\\{1,\\\\,1,\\\\,2,\\\\,2,\\\\,3\\\\}$$$ you can find $$$4$$$ subsets $$$\\\\{1,\\\\,2,\\\\,3\\\\}$$$.Try to guess the number of tiles in the initial set with value $$$i$$$ for all integers $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$).The second line contains two integers which represent the number of triplet subsets and straight subsets of the initial set respectively.OutputWhen you are ready to answer, print a single line of form \"! $$$a_1$$$ $$$a_2$$$ $$$\\\\ldots$$$ $$$a_n$$$\" ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is equal to the number of tiles in the initial set with value $$$i$$$.InteractionTo insert a tile, print a single line of form \"+ $$$x$$$\" ($$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le n$$$), where $$$x$$$ is the value of the tile you insert. Then you should read two integers which represent the number of triplet subsets and straight subsets of the current set respectively.After printing a line, do not forget to flush the output. Otherwise, you will getIdleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:fflush(stdout)orcout.flush()in C++;System.out.flush()in Java;flush(output)in Pascal;stdout.flush()in Python;see documentation for other languages.You will getWrong answerif you insert more than $$$n$$$ tiles.HacksTo make a hack you should provide a test in such format:The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$)  — $$$a_i$$$ is equal to the number of tiles with value $$$i$$$ in the set.ExampleInput5 1 6 2 9 5 12 5 24 6 24Output+ 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 ! 2 1 3 0 2NoteIn the first test, the initial set of tiles is $$$\\\\{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5\\\\}$$$. It has only one triplet subset $$$\\\\{3, 3, 3\\\\}$$$ and six straight subsets, all equal to $$$\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}$$$. After inserting a tile with value $$$1$$$ the set of tiles will be $$$\\\\{1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5\\\\}$$$ and will have two triplet subsets $$$\\\\{1, 1, 1\\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\{3, 3, 3\\\\}$$$ and nine straight subsets, all equal to $$$\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "918e6a28", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of tiles with integer values between 1 and $n$.
