Make Them Equaltime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$positiveintegers, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation no more than $$$3n$$$ times:choose three integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i, j \\\\le n$$$; $$$0 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^9$$$);assign $$$a_i := a_i - x \\\\cdot i$$$, $$$a_j := a_j + x \\\\cdot i$$$.After each operation, all elements of the array should benon-negative.Can you find a sequence of no more than $$$3n$$$ operations after which all elements of the array are equal?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.OutputFor each test case print the answer to it as follows:if there is no suitable sequence of operations, print $$$-1$$$;otherwise, print one integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le 3n$$$) — the number of operations in the sequence. Then print $$$k$$$ lines, the $$$m$$$-th of which should contain three integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i, j \\\\le n$$$; $$$0 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^9$$$) for the $$$m$$$-th operation.If there are multiple suitable sequences of operations, print any of them. Note that you don't have to minimize $$$k$$$.ExampleInput3 4 2 16 4 18 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 11 19 1 1 3Output2 4 1 2 2 3 3 -1 4 1 2 4 2 4 5 2 3 3 4 5 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "fd4fa311", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ positive integers.
