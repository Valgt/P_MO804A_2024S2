It is known that Vus has exactly $$$m$$$ pens and $$$k$$$ notebooks.Determine whether the Cossack can rewardallparticipants, giving each of them at least one pen and at least one notebook.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, m, k \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of participants, the number of pens, and the number of notebooks respectively.OutputPrint \"Yes\" if it possible to reward all the participants.

The Cossack has $$$8$$$ pens and $$$6$$$ notebooks. Therefore, he has enough pens and notebooks.In the second example, there are $$$3$$$ participants. The Cossack has $$$9$$$ pens and $$$3$$$ notebooks. He has more than enough pens but only the minimum needed number of notebooks.In the third example, there are $$$8$$$ participants but only $$$5$$$ pens. Since the Cossack does not have enough pens, the answer is \"No\".", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1497ffc4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given three numbers: $n$, $m$, and $k$.  \n\n* $n$ is the number of people.\n* $m$ is the number of pens.\n* $k$ is the number of notebooks.\n\nDetermine if it is possible to give each of the $n$ people at least one pen and at least one notebook. \n\nIf it is possible, print \"Yes\".
