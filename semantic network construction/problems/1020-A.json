New Building for SIStime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are looking at the floor plan of the Summer Informatics School's new building. You were tasked with SIS logistics, so you really care about travel time between different locations: it is important to know how long it would take to get from the lecture room to the canteen, or from the gym to the server room.The building consists ofntowers,hfloors each, where the towers are labeled from1ton, the floors are labeled from1toh. There is a passage between any two adjacent towers (two towersiandi+ 1for alli:1 ≤i≤n- 1) on every floorx, wherea≤x≤b. It takes exactly one minute to walk between any two adjacent floors of a tower, as well as between any two adjacent towers, provided that there is a passage on that floor. It is not permitted to leave the building.The picture illustrates the first example.You have givenkpairs of locations(ta,fa),(tb,fb): floorfaof towertaand floorfbof towertb. For each pair you need to determine the minimum walking time between these locations.InputThe first line of the input contains following integers:n: the number of towers in the building (1 ≤n≤ 108),h: the number of floors in each tower (1 ≤h≤ 108),aandb: the lowest and highest floor where it's possible to move between adjacent towers (1 ≤a≤b≤h),k: total number of queries (1 ≤k≤ 104).Nextklines contain description of the queries. Each description consists of four integersta,fa,tb,fb(1 ≤ta,tb≤n,1 ≤fa,fb≤h). This corresponds to a query to find the minimum travel time betweenfa-th floor of theta-th tower andfb-th floor of thetb-th tower.OutputFor each query print a single integer: the minimum walking time between the locations in minutes.ExampleInput3 6 2 3 31 2 1 31 4 3 41 2 2 3Output142", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a3d05807", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "A building has $n$ towers, with $h$ floors in each tower.
