Paint Chargestime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA horizontal grid strip of $$$n$$$ cells is given. In the $$$i$$$-th cell, there is a paint charge of size $$$a_i$$$. This charge can be:either used to the left — then all cells to the left at a distance less than $$$a_i$$$ (from $$$\\\\max(i - a_i + 1, 1)$$$ to $$$i$$$ inclusive) will be painted,or used to the right — then all cells to the right at a distance less than $$$a_i$$$ (from $$$i$$$ to $$$\\\\min(i + a_i - 1, n)$$$ inclusive) will be painted,or not used at all.Note that a charge can be used no more than once (that is, itcannotbe used simultaneously to the left and to the right). It is allowed for a cell to be painted more than once.What is the minimum number of times a charge needs to be used to paint all the cells of the strip?InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. This is followed by descriptions of $$$t$$$ test cases.Each test case is specified by two lines. The first one contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of cells in the strip. The second line contains $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the size of the paint charge in the $$$i$$$-th cell from the left of the strip.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ in the test does not exceed $$$1000$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum number of times the charges need to be used to paint all the cells of the strip.ExampleInput131121 122 121 222 231 1 133 1 231 3 171 2 3 1 2 4 272 1 1 1 2 3 1102 2 5 1 6 1 8 2 8 262 1 2 1 1 261 1 4 1 3 2Output1 2 1 1 1 3 1 2 3 4 2 3 3NoteIn the third test case of the example, it is sufficient to use the charge from the $$$1$$$-st cell to the right, then it will cover both cells $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$.In the ninth test case of the example, you need to:use the charge from the $$$3$$$-rd cell to the left, covering cells from the $$$1$$$-st to the $$$3$$$-rd;use the charge from the $$$5$$$-th cell to the left, covering cells from the $$$4$$$-th to the $$$5$$$-th;use the charge from the $$$7$$$-th cell to the left, covering cells from the $$$6$$$-th to the $$$7$$$-th.In the eleventh test case of the example, you need to:use the charge from the $$$5$$$-th cell to the right, covering cells from the $$$5$$$-th to the $$$10$$$-th;use the charge from the $$$7$$$-th cell to the left, covering cells from the $$$1$$$-st to the $$$7$$$-th.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b8846f4b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a line of $n$ cells, each with a paint charge of size $a_i$.
