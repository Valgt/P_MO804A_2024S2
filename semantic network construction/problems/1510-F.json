Fiber Shapetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputImagine a board with $$$n$$$ pins put into it, the $$$i$$$-th pin is located at $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$. For simplicity, we will restrict the problem to the case where the pins are placed in vertices of a convex polygon.Then, take a non-stretchable string of length $$$l$$$, and put it around all the pins. Place a pencil inside the string and draw a curve around the pins, trying to pull the string in every possible direction. The picture below shows an example of a string tied around the pins and pulled by a pencil (a point $$$P$$$).Your task is to find an area inside this curve. Formally, for a given convex polygon $$$S$$$ and a length $$$l$$$ let's define afiber shape$$$F(S, l)$$$ as a set of points $$$t$$$ such that the perimeter of the convex hull of $$$S \\\\cup \\\\{t\\\\}$$$ does not exceed $$$l$$$. Find an area of $$$F(S, l)$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$l$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^4$$$; $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le 8 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices of the polygon $$$S$$$ and the length of the string. Next $$$n$$$ lines contain integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le 10^5$$$) — coordinates of polygon's vertices in counterclockwise order. All internal angles of the polygon are strictly less than $$$\\\\pi$$$. The length $$$l$$$ exceeds the perimeter of the polygon by at least $$$10^{-3}$$$.OutputOutput a single floating-point number — the area of the fiber shape $$$F(S, l)$$$. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.ExamplesInput3 4 0 0 1 0 0 1Output3.012712585980357Input4 5 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1Output5.682061989789656Input5 17 0 0 2 -1 3 0 4 3 -1 4Output37.719371276930820NoteThe following pictures illustrate the example tests.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d78c8576", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a polygon and a string.
