Puzzlestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe end of the school year is near and Ms. Manana, the teacher, will soon have to say goodbye to a yet another class. She decided to prepare a goodbye present for hernstudents and give each of them a jigsaw puzzle (which, as wikipedia states, is a tiling puzzle that requires the assembly of numerous small, often oddly shaped, interlocking and tessellating pieces).The shop assistant told the teacher that there arempuzzles in the shop, but they might differ in difficulty and size. Specifically, the first jigsaw puzzle consists off1pieces, the second one consists off2pieces and so on.Ms. Manana doesn't want to upset the children, so she decided that the difference between the numbers of pieces in her presents must be as small as possible. LetAbe the number of pieces in the largest puzzle that the teacher buys andBbe the number of pieces in the smallest such puzzle. She wants to choose suchnpuzzles thatA-Bis minimum possible. Help the teacher and find the least possible value ofA-B.InputThe first line contains space-separated integersnandm(2 ≤n≤m≤ 50).

The class has 4 students. The shop sells 6 puzzles. If Ms. Manana buys the first four puzzles consisting of 10, 12, 10 and 7 pieces correspondingly, then the difference between the sizes of the largest and the smallest puzzle will be equal to 5. It is impossible to obtain a smaller difference. Note that the teacher can also buy puzzles 1, 3, 4 and 5 to obtain the difference 5.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "48ca3fa1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers, $n$ and $m$ (where $2 \\le n \\le m \\le 50$).
