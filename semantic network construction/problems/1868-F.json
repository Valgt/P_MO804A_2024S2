LIS?time limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEntering senior high school life, Tom is attracted by LIS problems, not only the Longest Increasing Subsequence problem, but also the Largest Interval Sum problem. Now he gets a really interesting problem from his friend Daniel. However, it seems too hard for him to solve it, so he asks you for help.Given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.In one operation, you do the following:Select an interval $$$[l,r]$$$ ($$$1\\\\le l\\\\le r\\\\le n$$$), such that the sum of the interval is the largest amongall intervalsin the array $$$a$$$. More formally, $$$\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=l}^r a_i=\\\\max_{1\\\\le l'\\\\le r'\\\\le n}\\\\sum_{i=l'}^{r'} a_i$$$.Then subtract $$$1$$$ from all elements $$$a_l,a_{l+1},\\\\ldots,a_r$$$.Find the minimum number of operations you need to perform to make $$$a_i<0$$$ for every $$$1\\\\le i\\\\le n$$$.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$-10^6\\\\le a_i\\\\le 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum number of operations.ExamplesInput5 1 2 3 4 5Output6Input6 -1 -5 -4 -1 -4 -7Output0Input11 0 1000000 1 -50000 2 998353 3 -100007 4 200943 0Output1936973NoteIn the first example, you can do operations on intervals $$$[1,5],[1,5],[2,5],[3,5],[4,5],[5,5]$$$ in such order. You may also do operations on intervals $$$[1,5],[2,5],[3,5],[4,5],[5,5],[1,5]$$$ in such order.In the second example, it's already satisfied that $$$a_i<0$$$ for every $$$1\\\\le i\\\\le n$$$. So you do not need to perform any operations.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ab45f5e1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a$ of length $n$.
