Digital Logarithmtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's define $$$f(x)$$$ for a positive integer $$$x$$$ as the length of the base-10 representation of $$$x$$$ without leading zeros. I like to call it a digital logarithm. Similar to a digital root, if you are familiar with that.You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, each containing $$$n$$$ positive integers. In one operation, you do the following:pick some integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$;assign either $$$f(a_i)$$$ to $$$a_i$$$ or $$$f(b_i)$$$ to $$$b_i$$$.Two arrays are considered similar to each other if you can rearrange the elements in both of them, so that they are equal (e. g. $$$a_i = b_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$).What's the smallest number of operations required to make $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ similar to each other?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of the testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in each of the arrays.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i < 10^9$$$).The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_j < 10^9$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print the smallest number of operations required to make $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ similar to each other.ExampleInput411100041 2 3 43 1 4 232 9 31 100 91075019 709259 5 611271314 9024533 81871864 9 3 6 48659503 2 371245467 6 7 37376159 8 364036498 52295554 169Output2 0 2 18NoteIn the first testcase, you can apply the digital logarithm to $$$b_1$$$ twice.In the second testcase, the arrays are already similar to each other.In the third testcase, you can first apply the digital logarithm to $$$a_1$$$, then to $$$b_2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "93e22608", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two arrays,  *a* and *b*, each containing *n* positive integers.  \n\nYou can perform the following operation:\n\n* Choose an index *i* from 1 to *n*.\n* Assign either *f(a<sub>i</sub>)* or *f(b<sub>i</sub>)* to *a<sub>i</sub>* or *b<sub>i</sub>* respectively.\n\nHere, *f(x)* is the number of digits in the base-10 representation of *x* (without leading zeros).\n\nTwo arrays are considered similar if you can rearrange their elements to make them equal.\n\nFind the minimum number of operations required to make the arrays *a* and *b* similar."}, {"prompt_md5": "74e6c524", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You have two lists of numbers.
