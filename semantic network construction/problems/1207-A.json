Calculate the maximum profit you can achieve.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent queries.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) – the number of queries.The first line of each query contains three integers $$$b$$$, $$$p$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b, ~p, ~f \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of buns, beef patties and chicken cutlets in your restaurant.The second line of each query contains two integers $$$h$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le h, ~c \\\\le 100$$$) — the hamburger and chicken burger prices in your restaurant.OutputFor each query print one integer — the maximum profit you can achieve.ExampleInput3 15 2 3 5 10 7 5 2 10 12 1 100 100 100 100Output40 34 0NoteIn first query you have to sell two hamburgers and three chicken burgers. Your income is $$$2 \\\\cdot 5 + 3 \\\\cdot 10 = 40$$$.In second query you have to ell one hamburgers and two chicken burgers. Your income is $$$1 \\\\cdot 10 + 2 \\\\cdot 12 = 34$$$.In third query you can not create any type of burgers because because you have only one bun.
