DIY Wooden Laddertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's denote a $$$k$$$-step ladder as the following structure: exactly $$$k + 2$$$ wooden planks, of whichtwo planks of lengthat least$$$k+1$$$ — the base of the ladder;$$$k$$$ planks of lengthat least$$$1$$$ — the steps of the ladder;Note that neither the base planks, nor the steps planks are required to be equal.For example, ladders $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ are correct $$$2$$$-step ladders and ladder $$$2$$$ is a correct $$$1$$$-step ladder. On the first picture the lengths of planks are $$$[3, 3]$$$ for the base and $$$[1]$$$ for the step. On the second picture lengths are $$$[3, 3]$$$ for the base and $$$[2]$$$ for the step. On the third picture lengths are $$$[3, 4]$$$ for the base and $$$[2, 3]$$$ for the steps.You have $$$n$$$ planks. The length of the $$$i$$$-th planks is $$$a_i$$$. You don't have a saw, so you can't cut the planks you have. Though you have a hammer and nails, so you can assemble the improvised \"ladder\" from the planks.The question is: what is the maximum number $$$k$$$ such that you can choose some subset of the given planks and assemble a $$$k$$$-step ladder using them?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of queries. The queries are independent.Each query consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of planks you have.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the lengths of the corresponding planks.It's guaranteed that the total number of planks from all queries doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$T$$$ integers — one per query. The $$$i$$$-th integer is the maximum number $$$k$$$, such that you can choose some subset of the planks given in the $$$i$$$-th query and assemble a $$$k$$$-step ladder using them.Print $$$0$$$ if you can't make even $$$1$$$-step ladder from the given set of planks.ExampleInput4 4 1 3 1 3 3 3 3 2 5 2 3 3 4 2 3 1 1 2Output2 1 2 0NoteExamples for the queries $$$1-3$$$ are shown at the image in the legend section.The Russian meme to express the quality of the ladders:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e88c1fc0", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of wooden planks, each with a specific length.
