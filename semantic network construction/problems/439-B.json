Devu, the Dumb Guytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutDevu is a dumb guy, his learning curve is very slow. You are supposed to teach himnsubjects, theithsubject hascichapters. When you teach him, you are supposed to teach all the chapters of a subject continuously.Let us say that his initial per chapter learning power of a subject isxhours. In other words he can learn a chapter of a particular subject inxhours.Well Devu is not complete dumb, there is a good thing about him too. If you teach him a subject, then time required to teach any chapter of the next subject will require exactly 1 hour less than previously required (see the examples to understand it more clearly). Note that his per chapter learning power can not be less than 1 hour.You can teach him thensubjects in any possible order. Find out minimum amount of time (in hours) Devu will take to understand all the subjects and you will be free to do some enjoying task rather than teaching a dumb guy.Please be careful that answer might not fit in 32 bit data type.InputThe first line will contain two space separated integersn,x(1 ≤n,x≤ 105). The next line will containnspace separated integers:c1,c2, ...,cn(1 ≤ci≤ 105).OutputOutput a single integer representing the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput2 34 1Output11Input4 25 1 2 1Output10Input3 31 1 1Output6NoteLook at the first example. Consider the order of subjects:1,2. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him3hours per chapter, so it will take12hours to teach first subject. After teaching first subject, his per chapter learning time will be2hours. Now teaching him second subject will take2 × 1 = 2hours. Hence you will need to spend12 + 2 = 14hours.Consider the order of subjects:2,1. When you teach Devu the second subject, then it will take him3hours per chapter, so it will take3 × 1 = 3hours to teach the second subject. After teaching the second subject, his per chapter learning time will be2hours. Now teaching him the first subject will take2 × 4 = 8hours. Hence you will need to spend11hours.So overall, minimum of both the cases is11hours.Look at the third example. The order in this example doesn't matter. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him3hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the second subject, it will take him2hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the third subject, it will take him1hours per chapter.
