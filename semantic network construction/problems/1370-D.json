Odd-Even Subsequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAshish has an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$.A subsequence of $$$a$$$ is defined as a sequence that can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by deleting some elements (possibly none), without changing the order of the remaining elements.Consider a subsequence $$$s$$$ of $$$a$$$. He defines the cost of $$$s$$$ as the minimum between:The maximum among all elements at odd indices of $$$s$$$.The maximum among all elements at even indices of $$$s$$$.Note that the index of an element is its index in $$$s$$$, rather than its index in $$$a$$$. The positions are numbered from $$$1$$$. So, the cost of $$$s$$$ is equal to $$$min(max(s_1, s_3, s_5, \\\\ldots), max(s_2, s_4, s_6, \\\\ldots))$$$.For example, the cost of $$$\\\\{7, 5, 6\\\\}$$$ is $$$min( max(7, 6), max(5) ) = min(7, 5) = 5$$$.Help him find the minimum cost of a subsequence of size $$$k$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$)  — the size of the array $$$a$$$ and the size of the subsequence.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$)  — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputOutput a single integer  — the minimum cost of a subsequence of size $$$k$$$.ExamplesInput4 2 1 2 3 4Output1Input4 3 1 2 3 4Output2Input5 3 5 3 4 2 6Output2Input6 4 5 3 50 2 4 5Output3NoteIn the first test, consider the subsequence $$$s$$$ = $$$\\\\{1, 3\\\\}$$$.
