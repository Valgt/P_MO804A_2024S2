Clique Partitiontime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. There is a graph on $$$n$$$ vertices, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, which initially has no edges.You have to assign each vertex an integer; let $$$a_i$$$ be the integer on the vertex $$$i$$$. All $$$a_i$$$ should be distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices $$$(i, j)$$$, you add an edge between them if $$$|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \\\\le k$$$.Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum possible (for the given values of $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$) number of cliques. Each vertex of the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve the problem \"given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques\". So we also ask you to print the partition itself.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1600$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 40$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 2n$$$).OutputFor each test case, print three lines:the first line should contain $$$n$$$distinctintegers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$) — the values you assign to the vertices;the second line should contain one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le n$$$) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into;the third line should contain $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le q$$$) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ are in the same clique if $$$c_u = c_v$$$.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExampleInput32 35 48 16Output2 1 1 1 1 3 1 5 2 4 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d8c2f9d9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers, $n$ and $k$.
