Pair the integers $$$1$$$ to $$$2n$$$ (i.e. each integer should be in exactly one pair) so that each sum of matched pairs is consecutive and distinct.Formally, let $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$ be the pairs that you matched. $$$\\\\{a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \\\\ldots, a_n, b_n\\\\}$$$ should be a permutation of $$$\\\\{1, 2, \\\\ldots, 2n\\\\}$$$. Let the sorted list of $$$\\\\{a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2, \\\\ldots, a_n+b_n\\\\}$$$ be $$$s_1 < s_2 < \\\\ldots < s_n$$$.

The description of the test cases follows.For each test case, a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$) is given.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, if it is impossible to make such a pairing, print \"No\".Otherwise, print \"Yes\" followed by $$$n$$$ lines.At each line, print two integers that are paired.You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower).
