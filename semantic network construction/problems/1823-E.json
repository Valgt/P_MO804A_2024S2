Removing Graphtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob are playing a game on a graph. They have an undirected graph without self-loops and multiple edges. All vertices of the graph havedegree equal to $$$2$$$. The graph may consist of several components. Note that if such graph has $$$n$$$ vertices, it will have exactly $$$n$$$ edges.Alice and Bob take turn. Alice goes first. In each turn, the player can choose $$$k$$$ ($$$l \\\\le k \\\\le r$$$; $$$l < r$$$) vertices that forma connected subgraphand erase these vertices from the graph, including all incident edges.The player who can't make a step loses.For example, suppose they are playing on the given graph with given $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 3$$$:A valid vertex set for Alice to choose at the first move is one of the following:$$$\\\\{1, 2\\\\}$$$$$$\\\\{1, 3\\\\}$$$$$$\\\\{2, 3\\\\}$$$$$$\\\\{4, 5\\\\}$$$$$$\\\\{4, 6\\\\}$$$$$$\\\\{5, 6\\\\}$$$$$$\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}$$$$$$\\\\{4, 5, 6\\\\}$$$Suppose, Alice chooses subgraph $$$\\\\{4, 6\\\\}$$$.Then a valid vertex set for Bob to choose at the first move is one of the following:$$$\\\\{1, 2\\\\}$$$$$$\\\\{1, 3\\\\}$$$$$$\\\\{2, 3\\\\}$$$$$$\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}$$$Suppose, Bob chooses subgraph $$$\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}$$$.Alice can't make a move, so she loses.You are given a graph of size $$$n$$$ and integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$.

The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u_i, v_i \\\\le n$$$; $$$u_i \\\\neq v_i$$$) — description of the $$$i$$$-th edge.It's guaranteed that the degree of each vertex of the given graph is equal to $$$2$$$.OutputPrintAlice(case-insensitive) if Alice wins, orBobotherwise.ExamplesInput6 2 3 1 2 2 3 3 1 4 5 5 6 6 4OutputBobInput6 1 2 1 2 2 3 3 1 4 5 5 6 6 4OutputBobInput12 1 3 1 2 2 3 3 1 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 4 8 9 9 10 10 11 11 12 12 8OutputAliceNoteIn the first test the same input as in legend is shown.In the second test the same graph as in legend is shown, but with $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "13800b14", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a graph with $n$ vertices and $n$ edges.
