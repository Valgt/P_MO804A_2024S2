Inversion SwapSorttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMadeline has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. A pair $$$(u, v)$$$ of integers forms an inversion in $$$a$$$ if:$$$1 \\\\le u < v \\\\le n$$$.$$$a_u > a_v$$$.Madeline recently found a magical paper, which allows her to write two indices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ and swap the values $$$a_u$$$ and $$$a_v$$$. Being bored, she decided to write a list of pairs $$$(u_i, v_i)$$$ with the following conditions:all the pairs in the list are distinct and form an inversion in $$$a$$$.all the pairs that form an inversion in $$$a$$$ are in the list.Starting from the given array, if you swap the values at indices $$$u_1$$$ and $$$v_1$$$, then the values at indices $$$u_2$$$ and $$$v_2$$$ and so on, then after all pairs are processed, the array $$$a$$$ will be sorted innon-decreasing order.Construct such a list or determine that no such list exists. If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$) — the length of the array.Next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,...,a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9)$$$  — elements of the array.OutputPrint-1if no such list exists. Otherwise in the first line you should print a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le m \\\\le \\\\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}$$$) — number of pairs in the list.The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$u_i, v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u_i < v_i\\\\le n$$$).If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.ExamplesInput3 3 1 2Output2 1 3 1 2Input4 1 8 1 6Output2 2 4 2 3Input5 1 1 1 2 2Output0NoteIn the first sample test case the array will change in this order $$$[3,1,2] \\\\rightarrow [2,1,3] \\\\rightarrow [1,2,3]$$$.In the second sample test case it will be $$$[1,8,1,6] \\\\rightarrow [1,6,1,8] \\\\rightarrow [1,1,6,8]$$$.In the third sample test case the array is already sorted.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "579a853d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
