Currency System in Geraldiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA magic island Geraldion, where Gerald lives, has its own currency system. It uses banknotes of several values. But the problem is, the system is not perfect and sometimes it happens that Geraldionians cannot express a certain sum of money with any set of banknotes. Of course, they can use any number of banknotes of each value. Such sum is calledunfortunate. Gerald wondered: what is the minimumunfortunatesum?InputThe first line contains numbern(1 ≤n≤ 1000) — the number of values of the banknotes that used in Geraldion.The second line containsndistinct space-separated numbersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 106) — the values of the banknotes.OutputPrint a single line — the minimumunfortunatesum.
