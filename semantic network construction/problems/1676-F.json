Longest Striketime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$, you are tasked to find any two numbers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$l \\\\leq r$$$) such that:For each $$$x$$$ $$$(l \\\\leq x \\\\leq r)$$$, $$$x$$$ appears in $$$a$$$ at least $$$k$$$ times (i.e. $$$k$$$ or more array elements are equal to $$$x$$$).The value $$$r-l$$$ is maximized.If no numbers satisfy the conditions, output-1.For example, if $$$a=[11, 11, 12, 13, 13, 14, 14]$$$ and $$$k=2$$$, then:for $$$l=12$$$, $$$r=14$$$ the first condition fails because $$$12$$$ does not appear at least $$$k=2$$$ times.for $$$l=13$$$, $$$r=14$$$ the first condition holds, because $$$13$$$ occurs at least $$$k=2$$$ times in $$$a$$$ and $$$14$$$ occurs at least $$$k=2$$$ times in $$$a$$$.for $$$l=11$$$, $$$r=11$$$ the first condition holds, because $$$11$$$ occurs at least $$$k=2$$$ times in $$$a$$$.A pair of $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ for which the first condition holds and $$$r-l$$$ is maximal is $$$l = 13$$$, $$$r = 14$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains the integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the minimum amount of times each number in the range $$$[l, r]$$$ should appear respectively.Then a single line follows, containing $$$n$$$ integers describing the array $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case output $$$2$$$ numbers, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ that satisfy the conditions, or \"-1\" if no numbers satisfy the conditions.If multiple answers exist, you can output any.ExampleInput47 211 11 12 13 13 14 145 16 3 5 2 16 44 3 4 3 3 414 21 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4Output13 14 1 3 -1 1 4", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "07eec67e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an array $a$ of length $n$ and an integer $k$, find two numbers $l$ and $r$ ($l \\leq r$) such that:\n\n* For each $x$ ($l \\leq x \\leq r$), the number $x$ appears in the array $a$ at least $k$ times.\n\nThe value $r-l$ should be as large as possible.
