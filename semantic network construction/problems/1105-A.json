Salem and Stickstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSalem gave you $$$n$$$ sticks with integer positive lengths $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$.For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ is $$$|a - b|$$$, where $$$|x|$$$ means the absolute value of $$$x$$$.A stick length $$$a_i$$$ is calledalmost goodfor some integer $$$t$$$ if $$$|a_i - t| \\\\le 1$$$.Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $$$t$$$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $$$t$$$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer.As an answer, print the value of $$$t$$$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $$$t$$$, print any of them.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of sticks.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 100$$$) — the lengths of the sticks.OutputPrint the value of $$$t$$$ and the minimum possible cost.
