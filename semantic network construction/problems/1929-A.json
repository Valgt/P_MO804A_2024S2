Sasha and the Beautiful Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSasha decided to give his girlfriend an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$. He found out that his girlfriend evaluates thebeautyof the array as the sum of the values $$$(a_i - a_{i - 1})$$$ for all integers $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$n$$$.Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array $$$a$$$ that he can obtain, if he can rearrange its elements in any way.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array $$$a$$$ that can be obtained.ExampleInput532 1 3369 69 695100 54 80 43 9043 4 3 322 1Output2 0 57 1 1NoteIn the first test case, the elements of the array $$$a$$$ can be rearranged to make $$$a = [1, 2, 3]$$$. Then its beauty will be equal to $$$(a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) = (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2$$$.In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the array $$$a$$$. Then its beauty will be equal to $$$0$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "43ec2fc5", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers.
