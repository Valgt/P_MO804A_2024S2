Luntik and Subsequencestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLuntik came out for a morning stroll and found an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. He calculated the sum $$$s$$$ of the elements of the array ($$$s= \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i$$$). Luntik calls a subsequence of the array $$$a$$$nearly fullif the sum of the numbers in that subsequence is equal to $$$s-1$$$.Luntik really wants to know the number ofnearly fullsubsequences of the array $$$a$$$. But he needs to come home so he asks you to solve that problem!A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The next $$$2 \\\\cdot t$$$ lines contain descriptions of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 60$$$) — the length of the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case print the number ofnearly fullsubsequences of the array.ExampleInput5 5 1 2 3 4 5 2 1000 1000 2 1 0 5 3 0 2 1 1 5 2 1 0 3 0Output1 0 2 4 4NoteIn the first test case, $$$s=1+2+3+4+5=15$$$, only $$$(2,3,4,5)$$$ is a nearly full subsequence among all subsequences, the sum in it is equal to $$$2+3+4+5=14=15-1$$$.In the second test case, there are no nearly full subsequences.In the third test case, $$$s=1+0=1$$$, the nearly full subsequences are $$$(0)$$$ and $$$()$$$ (the sum of an empty subsequence is $$$0$$$).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "19e2ea29", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
