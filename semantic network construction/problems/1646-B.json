Initially, all the elements of the sequence are unpainted. You can paint each number $$$\\\\RED$$$ or $$$\\\\BLUE$$$ (but not both), orleave it unpainted.For a color $$$c$$$, $$$\\\\text{Count}(c)$$$ is the number of elements in the sequence painted with that color and $$$\\\\text{Sum}(c)$$$ is the sum of the elements in the sequence painted with that color.For example, if the given sequence is $$$[2, 8, 6, 3, 1]$$$ and it is painted this way: $$$[\\\\myblue{2}, 8, \\\\myred{6}, \\\\myblue{3}, 1]$$$ (where $$$6$$$ is painted red, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ are painted blue, $$$1$$$ and $$$8$$$ are unpainted) then $$$\\\\text{Sum}(\\\\RED)=6$$$, $$$\\\\text{Sum}(\\\\BLUE)=2+3=5$$$, $$$\\\\text{Count}(\\\\RED)=1$$$, and $$$\\\\text{Count}(\\\\BLUE)=2$$$.Determine if it is possible to paint the sequence so that $$$\\\\text{Sum}(\\\\RED) > \\\\text{Sum}(\\\\BLUE)$$$ and $$$\\\\text{Count}(\\\\RED) < \\\\text{Count}(\\\\BLUE)$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3\\\\le n\\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the given sequence.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0\\\\le a_i\\\\le 10^9$$$) — the given sequence.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, printYESif it is possible to paint the given sequence satisfying the above requirements, andNOotherwise.You can outputYESandNOin any case (for example, stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput431 2 352 8 6 3 143 5 4 251000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000OutputNO YES NO NONoteIn the first test case, there is no possible way to paint the sequence. For example, if you paint the sequence this way: $$$[\\\\myblue{1},\\\\myblue{2},\\\\myred{3}]$$$ (where $$$3$$$ is painted red, $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ are painted blue) then $$$\\\\text{Count}(\\\\RED)=1 < \\\\text{Count}(\\\\BLUE)=2$$$, but $$$\\\\text{Sum}(\\\\RED)=3 \\\\ngtr \\\\text{Sum}(\\\\BLUE)=3$$$. So, this is not a possible way to paint the sequence.In the second test case, a possible way to paint the sequence is described in the statement. We can see that $$$\\\\text{Sum}(\\\\RED)=6 > \\\\text{Sum}(\\\\BLUE)=5$$$ and $$$\\\\text{Count}(\\\\RED)=1 < \\\\text{Count}(\\\\BLUE)=2$$$.In the third test case, there is no possible way to paint the sequence. For example, if you paint the sequence this way: $$$[\\\\myred{3},\\\\myred{5},\\\\myblue{4}, \\\\myblue{2}]$$$ (where $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ are painted red, $$$4$$$ and $$$2$$$ are painted blue) then $$$\\\\text{Sum}(\\\\RED) = 8 > \\\\text{Sum}(\\\\BLUE) = 6$$$ but $$$\\\\text{Count}(\\\\RED) = 2 \\\\nless \\\\text{Count}(\\\\BLUE) = 2$$$. So, this is not a possible way to paint the sequence.In the fourth test case, it can be proven that there is no possible way to paint the sequence satisfying sum and count constraints.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5b374a4e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ non-negative integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
