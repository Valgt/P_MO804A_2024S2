Any two cities are joined by no more than one path. No path joins a city with itself. According to a well-known tradition, the road network was built so that it would be impossible to choose three cities from each of which one can get to any other one directly. That is, there was no cycle exactly as long as 3. Unfortunately, the road map has not been preserved till nowadays. Now the scientists are interested how much developed a country Ancient Berland was. Help them - find, what maximal number of roads could be in the country. You also have to restore any of the possible road maps.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of cities in Berland.OutputOn the first line must be printed numberm— the maximal number of roads in Berland. Then printmlines containing two numbers each — the numbers of cities that the given road joins. The cities are numbered with integers from1ton. If there are several variants of solving the problem, print any of them.ExamplesInput3Output21 22 3Input4Output41 22 33 44 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d2f5d8c3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$ representing the number of cities.  \n\nFind the maximum number of roads that can connect these cities such that there are no sets of three cities where each city can be directly reached from the other two.\n\nOutput the maximum number of roads and then list each road as a pair of city numbers. \n\nFor example, if $n=3$, the output could be:\n\n2\n1 2\n2 3"}, {"prompt_md5": "df7eb1f2", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a number of cities.
