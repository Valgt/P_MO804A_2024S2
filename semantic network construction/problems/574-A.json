Bear and Electionstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLimak is a grizzly bear who desires power and adoration. He wants to win in upcoming elections and rule over the Bearland.There arencandidates, including Limak. We know how many citizens are going to vote for each candidate. Nowi-th candidate would getaivotes. Limak is candidate number1. To win in elections, he must get strictly more votes than any other candidate.Victory is more important than everything else so Limak decided to cheat. He will steal votes from his opponents by bribing some citizens. To bribe a citizen, Limak must give him or her one candy - citizens are bears and bears like candies. Limak doesn't have many candies and wonders - how many citizens does he have to bribe?InputThe first line contains single integern(2 ≤n≤ 100) - number of candidates.The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 1000) - number of votes for each candidate. Limak is candidate number1.Note that after bribing number of votes for some candidate might be zero or might be greater than1000.OutputPrint the minimum number of citizens Limak must bribe to have strictly more votes than any other candidate.ExamplesInput55 1 11 2 8Output4Input41 8 8 8Output6Input27 6Output0NoteIn the first sample Limak has5votes. One of the ways to achieve victory is to bribe4citizens who want to vote for the third candidate. Then numbers of votes would be9, 1, 7, 2, 8(Limak would have9votes). Alternatively, Limak could steal only3votes from the third candidate and1vote from the second candidate to get situation9, 0, 8, 2, 8.In the second sample Limak will steal2votes from each candidate. Situation will be7, 6, 6, 6.In the third sample Limak is a winner without bribing any citizen.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "47d7bbff", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ candidates running in an election.
