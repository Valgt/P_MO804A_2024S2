Find any such rectangular matrix of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$ that satisfies all of the following conditions:each row of the matrix contains exactly $$$a$$$ ones;each column of the matrix contains exactly $$$b$$$ ones;all other elements are zeros.If the desired matrix does not exist, indicate this.For example, for $$$n=3$$$, $$$m=6$$$, $$$a=2$$$, $$$b=1$$$, there exists a matrix satisfying the conditions above:$$$$$$ \\\\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\end{vmatrix} $$$$$$InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case is described by four positive integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$; $$$1 \\\\le a \\\\le m \\\\le 50$$$), where $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ are the sizes of the matrix, and $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are the number of ones for rows and columns, respectively.OutputFor each test case print:\"YES\" (without quotes) and the required matrix (if there are several answers, print any) if it exists, or\"NO\" (without quotes) if it does not exist.To print the matrix $$$n \\\\times m$$$, print $$$n$$$ rows, each of which consists of $$$m$$$ numbers $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ describing a row of the matrix.
