In particular, one of the nights impressed her deeply, giving her the illusion that all her fancies would be realized.On that night, Sengoku constructed a permutationp1,p2, ...,pnof integers from1toninclusive, with each integer representing a colour, wishing for the colours to see in the coming meteor outburst. Two incredible outbursts then arrived, each withnmeteorids, colours of which being integer sequencesa1,a2, ...,anandb1,b2, ...,bnrespectively. Meteoroids' colours were also between1andninclusive, and the two sequences were not identical, that is, at least onei(1 ≤i≤n) exists, such thatai≠biholds.Well, she almost had it all — each of the sequencesaandbmatched exactlyn- 1elements in Sengoku's permutation. In other words, there is exactly onei(1 ≤i≤n) such thatai≠pi, and exactly onej(1 ≤j≤n) such thatbj≠pj.For now, Sengoku is able to recover the actual colour sequencesaandbthrough astronomical records, but her wishes have been long forgotten. You are to reconstruct any possible permutation Sengoku could have had on that night.InputThe first line of input contains a positive integern(2 ≤n≤ 1 000) — the length of Sengoku's permutation, being the length of both meteor outbursts at the same time.The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤n) — the sequence of colours in the first meteor outburst.The third line containsnspace-separated integersb1,b2, ...,bn(1 ≤bi≤n) — the sequence of colours in the second meteor outburst. At least onei(1 ≤i≤n) exists, such thatai≠biholds.OutputOutputnspace-separated integersp1,p2, ...,pn, denoting a possible permutation Sengoku could have had.
