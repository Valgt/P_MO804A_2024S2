Each group must contain two apples, and the greatest common divisor of numbers of the apples in each group must be greater than 1. Of course, each apple can be part of at most one group.Jzzhu wonders how to get the maximum possible number of groups. Can you help him?InputA single integern(1 ≤n≤ 105), the number of the apples.OutputThe first line must contain a single integerm, representing the maximum number of groups he can get.
