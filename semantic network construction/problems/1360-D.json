Buying Shovelstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp wants to buyexactly$$$n$$$ shovels. The shop sells packages with shovels. The store has $$$k$$$ types of packages: the package of the $$$i$$$-th type consists of exactly $$$i$$$ shovels ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le k$$$). The store has an infinite number of packages of each type.Polycarp wants to chooseonetype of packages and then buy several (one or more) packages of this type. What is the smallest number of packages Polycarp will have to buy to get exactly $$$n$$$ shovels?For example, if $$$n=8$$$ and $$$k=7$$$, then Polycarp will buy $$$2$$$ packages of $$$4$$$ shovels.Help Polycarp find the minimum number of packages that he needs to buy, given that he:will buy exactly $$$n$$$ shovels in total;the sizes ofallpackages he will buy are all the same and the number of shovels in each package is an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, inclusive.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then, $$$t$$$ test cases follow, one per line.Each test case consists of two positive integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the number of shovels and the number of types of packages.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ answers to the test cases.
