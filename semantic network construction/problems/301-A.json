Yaroslav and Sequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYaroslav has an array, consisting of(2·n- 1)integers. In a single operation Yaroslav can change the sign of exactlynelements in the array. In other words, in one operation Yaroslav can select exactlynarray elements, and multiply each of them by -1.Yaroslav is now wondering: what maximum sum of array elements can be obtained if it is allowed to perform any number of described operations?Help Yaroslav.InputThe first line contains an integern(2 ≤n≤ 100). The second line contains(2·n- 1)integers — the array elements. The array elements do not exceed1000in their absolute value.OutputIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum sum that Yaroslav can get.ExamplesInput250 50 50Output150Input2-1 -100 -1Output100NoteIn the first sample you do not need to change anything. The sum of elements equals150.In the second sample you need to change the sign of the first two elements. Then we get the sum of the elements equal to100.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0d9cae28", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $2n-1$ integers.
