Beautiful Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputStanley defines the beauty of an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, which containsnon-negative integers, as follows: $$$$$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{a_{i}}{k} \\\\right \\\\rfloor,$$$$$$ which means that we divide each element by $$$k$$$, round it down, and sum up the resulting values.Stanley told Sam the integer $$$k$$$ and asked him to find an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers, such that the beauty is equal to $$$b$$$ and the sum of elements is equal to $$$s$$$. Help Sam — find any of the arrays satisfying the conditions above.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^{5}$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 10^{9}$$$, $$$0 \\\\leq b \\\\leq 10^{9}$$$, $$$0 \\\\leq s \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print $$$-1$$$ if such array $$$a$$$ does not exist. Otherwise print $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_{i} \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$) — the answer.ExampleInput81 6 3 1003 6 3 123 6 3 195 4 7 385 4 7 8099978 1000000000 100000000 10000000000000000001 1 0 04 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000000000000Output-1 -1 0 0 19 0 3 3 3 29 -1 -1 0 0 0 0 1000000000000000000NoteIn the first, the second, the fifth and the sixth test cases of the example it is possible to show that such array does not exist.In the third testcase of the example $$$a = [0, 0, 19]$$$.
