Traveling Salesman Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are living on an infinite plane with the Cartesian coordinate system on it. In one move you can go to any of the four adjacent points (left, right, up, down).More formally, if you are standing at the point $$$(x, y)$$$, you can:go left, and move to $$$(x - 1, y)$$$, orgo right, and move to $$$(x + 1, y)$$$, orgo up, and move to $$$(x, y + 1)$$$, orgo down, and move to $$$(x, y - 1)$$$.There are $$$n$$$ boxes on this plane. The $$$i$$$-th box has coordinates $$$(x_i,y_i)$$$. It is guaranteed that the boxes are either on the $$$x$$$-axis or the $$$y$$$-axis. That is, either $$$x_i=0$$$ or $$$y_i=0$$$.You can collect a box if you and the box are at the same point. Find the minimum number of moves you have to perform to collect all of these boxes if you have tostart and finishat the point $$$(0,0)$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of boxes.The $$$i$$$-th line of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-100 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le 100$$$) — the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th box. It is guaranteed that either $$$x_i=0$$$ or $$$y_i=0$$$.Do note that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases is not bounded.OutputFor each test case output a single integer — the minimum number of moves required.ExampleInput340 -21 0-1 00 230 2-3 00 -110 0Output12 12 0NoteIn the first test case, a possible sequence of moves that uses the minimum number of moves required is shown below.$$$$$$(0,0) \\\\to (1,0) \\\\to (1,1) \\\\to (1, 2) \\\\to (0,2) \\\\to (-1,2) \\\\to (-1,1) \\\\to (-1,0) \\\\to (-1,-1) \\\\to (-1,-2) \\\\to (0,-2) \\\\to (0,-1) \\\\to (0,0)$$$$$$In the second test case, a possible sequence of moves that uses the minimum number of moves required is shown below.$$$$$$(0,0) \\\\to (0,1) \\\\to (0,2) \\\\to (-1, 2) \\\\to (-2,2) \\\\to (-3,2) \\\\to (-3,1) \\\\to (-3,0) \\\\to (-3,-1) \\\\to (-2,-1) \\\\to (-1,-1) \\\\to (0,-1) \\\\to (0,0)$$$$$$In the third test case, we can collect all boxes without making any moves.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5e04dd7b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are on a grid with an infinite number of points.
