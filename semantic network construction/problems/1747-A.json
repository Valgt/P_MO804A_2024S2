Two Groupstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. You want to distribute these $$$n$$$ integers into two groups $$$s_1$$$ and $$$s_2$$$ (groups can be empty) so that the following conditions are satisfied:For each $$$i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n)$$$, $$$a_i$$$ goes into exactly one group.The value $$$|sum(s_1)| - |sum(s_2)|$$$ is the maximum possible among all such ways to distribute the integers.Here $$$sum(s_1)$$$ denotes the sum of the numbers in the group $$$s_1$$$, and $$$sum(s_2)$$$ denotes the sum of the numbers in the group $$$s_2$$$.Determine the maximum possible value of $$$|sum(s_1)| - |sum(s_2)|$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^4)$$$  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5)$$$  — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2 \\\\ldots a_n$$$ $$$(-10^9 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9)$$$  — elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer  — the maximum possible value of $$$|sum(s_1)| - |sum(s_2)|$$$.ExampleInput4210 -104-2 -1 11 032 3 25-9 2 0 0 -4Output0 8 7 11NoteIn thefirst testcase, we can distribute as $$$s_1 = \\\\{10\\\\}$$$, $$$s_2 = \\\\{-10\\\\}$$$.
