The cell $$$(x, y)$$$ is calledNash equilibriumif both of the following conditions hold:for each $$$x_1 \\\\neq x$$$ $$$A_{xy} > A_{x_1y}$$$;for each $$$y_1 \\\\neq y$$$ $$$A_{xy} < A_{xy_1}$$$.Find a Nash equilibrium in $$$A$$$. If there exist several equilibria, print the one with minimum $$$x$$$. If still there are several possible answers, print the one with minimum $$$y$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n, m \\\\leq 1000$$$), denoting the size of the table.Each of next $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ space-separated integers $$$A_{ij}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq A_{ij} \\\\leq 10^9$$$).OutputOutput $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ â€” the coordinates of the lexicographically minimum Nash equilibrium in the table. In case there is no answer, print two zeroes instead.ExamplesInput4 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 5 1 2 3 6 2 3 5 7Output1 4Input3 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7Output0 0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f378d0a5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a 2-dimensional table of integers with $n$ rows and $m$ columns.
