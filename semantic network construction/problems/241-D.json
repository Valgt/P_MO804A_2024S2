Numberstime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYou have a sequence ofndistinct integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤n). You want to remove some integers in such a way that the resulting sequence of integers satisfies the following three conditions:the resulting sequence is not empty;the exclusive or (xoroperation) of all the integers in the resulting sequence equals0;if you write all the integers of the resulting sequence (from beginning to the end) in a row in the decimal numeral system and without any spaces, the written number is divisible byp.You are given the sequence ofnintegersaand a prime numberp, find a way to satisfy the described conditions.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandp(1 ≤n,p≤ 50000). Next line containsnspace-separated distinct integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤n).It is guaranteed thatpis a prime number.OutputIf there is no solution for the given input, print \"No\" (without quotes) in the only line of the output.Otherwise print \"Yes\" in the first line of output. The second line should contain an integerk(k> 0)specifying the number of remaining elements and the third line should containkdistinct integersx1,x2, ...,xk(1 ≤xi≤n). These integers mean that you should remove all integers from the sequence except integersax1,ax2, ...,axkto satisfy the described conditions.If there are multiple solutions, any of them will be accepted.ExamplesInput3 31 2 3OutputYes31 2 3Input3 51 2 3OutputNo", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "849e4d74", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of distinct numbers and a prime number.
