Jumping Through the Arraytime limit per test8 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array of integers $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ and a permutation $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$. There are $$$q$$$ queries of three types coming to you:For given numbers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, calculate the sum in array $$$a$$$ on the segment from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$: $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=l}^{r} a_i$$$.You are given two numbers $$$v$$$ and $$$x$$$. Let's build a directed graph from the permutation $$$p$$$: it has $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$n$$$ edges $$$i \\\\to p_i$$$. Let $$$C$$$ be the set of vertices that are reachable from $$$v$$$ in this graph. You should add $$$x$$$ to all $$$a_u$$$ such that $$$u$$$ is in $$$C$$$.You are given indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$. You should swap $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$.The graph corresponding to the permutation $$$[2, 3, 1, 5, 4]$$$.Please, process all queries and print answers to queries of type $$$1$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array and permutation.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^8 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^8$$$).The third line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$).The fourth line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ — the number of queries ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).Next $$$q$$$ lines contain description of queries. The $$$i$$$-th of them starts with an integer $$$t_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t_i \\\\le 3$$$) — the query type.If $$$t_i = 1$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th line also contains two integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$).If $$$t_i = 2$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th line also contains two integers $$$v$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v \\\\le n$$$, $$$-10^8 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^8$$$).If $$$t_i = 3$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th line also contains also two integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i, j \\\\le n$$$).OutputFor every first type query, print a single integer — the answer to this query.ExamplesInput5 6 9 -5 3 0 2 3 1 5 4 6 1 1 5 2 1 1 1 1 5 3 1 5 2 1 -1 1 1 5Output13 16 11Input8 -15 52 -4 3 5 9 0 5 2 4 6 8 1 3 5 7 10 2 2 2 2 5 -1 1 1 8 1 1 5 1 5 8 3 1 6 2 1 50 1 1 8 2 6 -20 1 1 8Output61 45 22 461 301Input1 1 1 1 1 1 1Output1NoteIn the first example:The graph corresponding to the initial permutation.There are $$$6$$$ queries.The sum on the segment from $$$1$$$ to $$$5$$$ is $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 6 + 9 + (-5) + 3 + 0 = 13$$$.If we start from $$$1$$$, we can reach $$$\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}$$$. After this query $$$a$$$ is: $$$[7, 10, -4, 3, 0]$$$.The sum on the segment from $$$1$$$ to $$$5$$$ is $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 6 + 9 + (-5) + 3 + 0 = 16$$$.After this query $$$p = [4, 3, 1, 5, 2]$$$.The graph corresponding to the new permutation.If we start from $$$2$$$, we can reach $$$\\\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\\\}$$$. After this query $$$a$$$ is: $$$[6, 9, -5, 2, -1]$$$.The sum on the segment from $$$1$$$ to $$$5$$$ is $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 6 + 9 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) = 11$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c53cf75c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a$ of size $n$ and a permutation $p$ of size $n$.
