These lines contain two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le u,v \\\\le n-1$$$) denoting an edge between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$u \\\\neq v$$$).It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.It is also guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^{5}$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$n+1$$$ integers: the number of paths in the tree, such that the MEX of all the node labels in that path is $$$k$$$ for each $$$k$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$.ExampleInput2 4 0 1 0 2 2 3 2 1 0Output1 2 1 1 1  0 0 1NoteIn example case $$$1$$$,For $$$k = 0$$$, there is $$$1$$$ path that is from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ as $$$MEX([2, 3]) = 0$$$.For $$$k = 1$$$, there are $$$2$$$ paths that is from $$$0$$$ to $$$2$$$ as $$$MEX([0, 2]) = 1$$$ and $$$0$$$ to $$$3$$$ as $$$MEX([0, 2, 3]) = 1$$$.For $$$k = 2$$$, there is $$$1$$$ path that is from $$$0$$$ to $$$1$$$ as $$$MEX([0, 1]) = 2$$$.For $$$k = 3$$$, there is $$$1$$$ path that is from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$ as $$$MEX([1, 0, 2]) = 3$$$For $$$k = 4$$$, there is $$$1$$$ path that is from $$$1$$$ to $$$3$$$ as $$$MEX([1, 0, 2, 3]) = 4$$$.In example case $$$2$$$,For $$$k = 0$$$, there are no such paths.For $$$k = 1$$$, there are no such paths.For $$$k = 2$$$, there is $$$1$$$ path that is from $$$0$$$ to $$$1$$$ as $$$MEX([0, 1]) = 2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c9088aed", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ nodes, numbered from 0 to $n-1$.
