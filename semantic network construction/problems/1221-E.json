Game With Stringtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\dots, s_n$$$, consisting of only characters.andX. They take alternating turns, and Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a contiguous substring consisting only of characters.and replaces each of them withX. Alice must select a substing of length $$$a$$$, and Bob must select a substring of length $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$a > b$$$.For example, if $$$s =$$$...X..and $$$a = 3$$$, $$$b = 2$$$, then after Alice's move string can turn only intoXXXX... And if it's Bob's turn and the string $$$s =$$$...X.., then after Bob's move the string can turn intoXX.X..,.XXX..or...XXX.Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who wins if they both play optimally.You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the number of queries.The first line of each query contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b < a \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each query contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$), consisting of only characters.andX.It is guaranteed that sum of all $$$|s|$$$ over all queries not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case printYESif Alice can win andNOotherwise.You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill all be recognized as positive answer).ExampleInput3 3 2 XX......XX...X 4 2 X...X.X..X 5 3 .......X..XOutputYES NO YESNoteIn the first query Alice can select substring $$$s_3 \\\\dots s_5$$$. After that $$$s$$$ turns intoXXXXX...XX...X. After that, no matter what move Bob makes, Alice can make the move (this will be her second move), but Bob can't make his second move.In the second query Alice can not win because she cannot even make one move.In the third query Alice can choose substring $$$s_2 \\\\dots s_6$$$.
