Logo Turtletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutA lot of people associate Logo programming language with turtle graphics. In this case the turtle moves along the straight line and accepts commands \"T\" (\"turn around\") and \"F\" (\"move 1 unit forward\").You are given a list of commands that will be given to the turtle. You have to change exactlyncommands from the list (one command can be changed several times). How far from the starting point can the turtle move after it followsallthe commands of the modified list?InputThe first line of input contains a stringcommands— the original list of commands. The stringcommandscontains between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, and contains only characters \"T\" and \"F\".The second line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 50) — the number of commands you have to change in the list.OutputOutput the maximum distance from the starting point to the ending point of the turtle's path. The ending point of the turtle's path is turtle's coordinate after it followsallthe commands of the modified list.ExamplesInputFT1Output2InputFFFTFFF2Output6NoteIn the first example the best option is to change the second command (\"T\") to \"F\" — this way the turtle will cover a distance of 2 units.In the second example you have to change two commands. One of the ways to cover maximal distance of 6 units is to change the fourth command and first or last one.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d79628d9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of commands, where each command is either \"T\" (turn around) or \"F\" (move 1 unit forward).
