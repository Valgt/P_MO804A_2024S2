Yet Another Counting Problemtime limit per test3.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and $$$q$$$ queries. The $$$i$$$-th query consists of two numbers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$, and the answer to it is the number of integers $$$x$$$ such that $$$l_i \\\\le x \\\\le r_i$$$, and $$$((x \\\\bmod a) \\\\bmod b) \\\\ne ((x \\\\bmod b) \\\\bmod a)$$$. Calculate the answer for each query.Recall that $$$y \\\\bmod z$$$ is the remainder of the division of $$$y$$$ by $$$z$$$. For example, $$$5 \\\\bmod 3 = 2$$$, $$$7 \\\\bmod 8 = 7$$$, $$$9 \\\\bmod 4 = 1$$$, $$$9 \\\\bmod 9 = 0$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 200$$$; $$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 500$$$).Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, each containing two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le 10^{18}$$$) for the corresponding query.OutputFor each test case, print $$$q$$$ integers — the answers to the queries of this test case in the order they appear.ExampleInput2 4 6 5 1 1 1 3 1 5 1 7 1 9 7 10 2 7 8 100 200Output0 0 0 2 4  0 91", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0e2af7bb", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers $a$ and $b$, and $q$ queries.
