But believe, the earnest and serious people are the ones who have the last laugh... But even then, I won't give you a present.—Santa,Hayate no Gotoku!Since Hayate didn't get any Christmas presents from Santa, he is instead left solving a tree query problem.Hayate has a tree with $$$n$$$ nodes.Hayate now wants you to answer $$$q$$$ queries. Each query consists of a node $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$ other additional nodes $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_k$$$. These $$$k+1$$$ nodes are guaranteed to be all distinct.For each query, you must find the length of the longest simple path starting at node $$$x^\\\\dagger$$$ after removing nodes $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_k$$$ along with all edges connected to at least one of nodes $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_k$$$.$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ A simple path of length $$$k$$$ starting at node $$$x$$$ is a sequence ofdistinctnodes $$$x=u_0,u_1,\\\\ldots,u_k$$$ such that there exists a edge between nodes $$$u_{i-1}$$$ and $$$u_i$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq k$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes of the tree and the number of queries.The following $$$n - 1$$$ lines contain two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u, v \\\\le n$$$, $$$u \\\\ne v$$$) — denoting an edge between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.The following $$$q$$$ lines describe the queries. Each line contains the integers $$$x$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x \\\\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\\\leq k < n$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq n$$$) — the starting node, the number of removed nodes and the removed nodes.It is guaranteed that for each query, $$$x,a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_k$$$ are all distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all queries will not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each query, output a single integer denoting the answer for that query.ExamplesInput7 7 1 2 1 3 3 4 2 5 2 6 6 7 2 0 2 1 1 2 2 1 6 3 1 4 3 1 1 5 0 5 2 1 6Output3 2 1 4 1 4 1Input4 4 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 1 3 3 1 4 2 1 4 2 3 1 3 4Output1 2 2 0NoteIn the first example, the tree is as follows:In the first query, no nodes are missing. The longest simple path starting from node $$$2$$$ is $$$2 \\\\to 1 \\\\to 3 \\\\to 4$$$. Thus, the answer is $$$3$$$.In the third query, nodes $$$1$$$ and $$$6$$$ are missing and the tree is shown below. The longest simple path starting from node $$$2$$$ is $$$2 \\\\to 5$$$. Thus, the answer is $$$1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "693178d1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ nodes.
