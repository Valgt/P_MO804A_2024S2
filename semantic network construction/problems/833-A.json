Its rules are very simple: in each round, a natural numberkis chosen. Then, the one who says (or barks) it faster than the other wins theround. After that, the winner's score is multiplied byk2, and the loser's score is multiplied byk. In the beginning of thegame, both Slastyona and Pushok have scores equal to one.Unfortunately, Slastyona had lost her notepad where the history of allngameswas recorded. She managed to recall the final results for each games, though, but all of her memories of them are vague.
