Game with Multisettime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn this problem, you are initially given an empty multiset. You have to process two types of queries:ADD$$$x$$$ — add an element equal to $$$2^{x}$$$ to the multiset;GET$$$w$$$ — say whether it is possible to take the sum of some subset of the current multiset and get a value equal to $$$w$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, each of which contains two integers $$$t_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$, denoting the $$$i$$$-th query. If $$$t_i = 1$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th query isADD$$$v_i$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le v_i \\\\le 29$$$). If $$$t_i = 2$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th query isGET$$$v_i$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le v_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor eachGETquery, printYESif it is possible to choose a subset with sum equal to $$$w$$$, orNOif it is impossible.ExamplesInput51 01 01 02 32 4OutputYES NOInput71 01 11 21 102 42 62 7OutputYES YES YES", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "bdf89c0c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an empty set of numbers.
