Max GEQ Sumtime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. You are asked to find out if the inequality $$$$$$\\\\max(a_i, a_{i + 1}, \\\\ldots, a_{j - 1}, a_{j}) \\\\geq a_i + a_{i + 1} + \\\\dots + a_{j - 1} + a_{j}$$$$$$ holds for all pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$, where $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$)  — the size of the array.The next line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, on a new line output \"YES\" if the condition is satisfied for the given array, and \"NO\" otherwise.
