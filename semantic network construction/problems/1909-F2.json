Small Permutation Problem (Hard Version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAndy Tunstall - MiniBoss⠀In the easy version, the $$$a_i$$$ are in the range $$$[0, n]$$$; in the hard version, the $$$a_i$$$ are in the range $$$[-1, n]$$$ and the definition of good permutation is slightly different. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.You are given an integer $$$n$$$ and an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ of integers in the range $$$[-1, n]$$$.A permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$$$ of $$$[1, 2, \\\\dots, n]$$$ is good if, for each $$$i$$$, the following condition is true:if $$$a_i \\\\neq -1$$$, the number of values $$$\\\\leq i$$$ in $$$[p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_i]$$$ is exactly $$$a_i$$$.Count the good permutations of $$$[1, 2, \\\\dots, n]$$$, modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$), which describe the conditions for a good permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of good permutations, modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.ExampleInput105-1 -1 -1 -1 -151 2 3 4 560 2 2 2 -1 -16-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 56-1 -1 3 2 -1 -1150 0 -1 -1 -1 2 2 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 11 13 1560 2 2 2 4 660 1 3 4 5 561 2 3 2 4 6150 0 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 11 13 15Output120 1 4 0 0 494403526 4 0 0 532305727NoteIn the first test case, all the permutations of length $$$5$$$ are good, so there are $$$120$$$ good permutations.In the second test case, the only good permutation is $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$$$.In the third test case, there are $$$4$$$ good permutations: $$$[2, 1, 5, 6, 3, 4]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 5, 6, 4, 3]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 6, 5, 3, 4]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 3]$$$. For example, $$$[2, 1, 5, 6, 3, 4]$$$ is good because:$$$a_1 = 0$$$, and there are $$$0$$$ values $$$\\\\leq 1$$$ in $$$[p_1] = [2]$$$;$$$a_2 = 2$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ values $$$\\\\leq 2$$$ in $$$[p_1, p_2] = [2, 1]$$$;$$$a_3 = 2$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ values $$$\\\\leq 3$$$ in $$$[p_1, p_2, p_3] = [2, 1, 5]$$$;$$$a_4 = 2$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ values $$$\\\\leq 4$$$ in $$$[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4] = [2, 1, 5, 6]$$$;$$$a_5 = -1$$$, so there are no restrictions on $$$[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5]$$$;$$$a_6 = -1$$$, so there are no restrictions on $$$[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "3e259954", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$ and an array $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ of integers in the range $[-1, n]$.\n\nA permutation $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$ of $[1, 2, ..., n]$ is good if, for each $i$, the following condition is true:\n\n* If $a_i \\neq -1$, the number of values $\\leq i$ in $[p_1, p_2, ..., p_i]$ is exactly $a_i$.\n\nCount the number of good permutations of $[1, 2, ..., n]$, modulo 998244353."}, {"prompt_md5": "ff35d481", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers.
