The first of them contains some balls ofndifferent colors.Ivan wants to play a strange game. He wants to distribute the balls into boxes in such a way that for everyi(1 ≤i≤n)i-th box will contain all balls with colori.In order to do this, Ivan will make some turns. Each turn he does the following:Ivan chooses any non-empty box and takes all balls from this box;Then Ivan chooses anykempty boxes (the box from the first step becomes empty, and Ivan is allowed to choose it), separates the balls he took on the previous step intoknon-empty groups and puts each group into one of the boxes. He should put each group into a separate box. He can choose eitherk= 2ork= 3.Thepenaltyof the turn is the number of balls Ivan takes from the box during the first step of the turn. Andpenaltyof the game is the totalpenaltyof turns made by Ivan until he distributes all balls to corresponding boxes.Help Ivan to determine the minimum possiblepenaltyof the game!InputThe first line contains one integer numbern(1 ≤n≤ 200000) — the number of boxes and colors.The second line containsninteger numbersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109), whereaiis the number of balls with colori.OutputPrint one number — the minimum possiblepenaltyof the game.ExamplesInput31 2 3Output6Input42 3 4 5Output19NoteIn the first example you take all the balls from the first box, choosek= 3and sort all colors to corresponding boxes. Penalty is6.In the second example you make two turns:Take all the balls from the first box, choosek= 3, put balls of color3to the third box, of color4— to the fourth box and the rest put back into the first box.
