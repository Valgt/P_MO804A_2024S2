Frog Jumpingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA frog is initially at position $$$0$$$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 10^9, 1 \\\\leq a,b \\\\leq 10^5$$$).OutputPrint a single integer, the desired sum.ExamplesInput7 5 3Output19Input1000000000 1 2019Output500000001500000001Input100 100000 1Output101Input6 4 5Output10NoteIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "64a66e71", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "A frog starts at position 0 on a number line.
