Scaletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTina has a square grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. Each cell in the grid is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.Tina wants to reduce the grid by a factor of $$$k$$$ ($$$k$$$ is adivisorof $$$n$$$). To do this, Tina splits the grid into $$$k \\\\times k$$$ nonoverlapping blocks of cells such that every cell belongs to exactly one block.Tina then replaces each block of cells with a single cell equal to the value of the cells in the block.It is guaranteed that every cell in the same block has the same value.For example, the following demonstration shows a grid being reduced by factor of $$$3$$$.Original grid$$$0$$$$$$0$$$$$$0$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$0$$$$$$0$$$$$$0$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$0$$$$$$0$$$$$$0$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$0$$$$$$0$$$$$$0$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$0$$$$$$0$$$$$$0$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$0$$$$$$0$$$$$$0$$$Reduced grid$$$0$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$0$$$Help Tina reduce the grid by a factor of $$$k$$$.InputThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) – the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1000$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$,$$$k$$$ is adivisorof $$$n$$$) — the number of rows and columns of the grid, and the factor that Tina wants to reduce the grid by.Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$n$$$ characters describing the cells of the grid.
