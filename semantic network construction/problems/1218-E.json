He was given an array $$$A = {a_1,a_2,...,a_N }$$$ of length $$$N$$$, and a number $$$K$$$.Define array $$$B$$$ as $$$B(q, A) = $$$ { $$$q-a_1, q-a_2, ..., q-a_N$$$ }. Define function $$$F$$$ as $$$F(B,K)$$$ being sum of products of all $$$K$$$-tuples of elements in array $$$B$$$. For example, if the array $$$B$$$ is $$$[2,3,4,5]$$$, and with $$$K=3$$$, sum of products of all 3-tuples is $$$$$$F(B, 3) = 2*3*4+2*3*5+3*4*5+2*4*5$$$$$$He was then given a number Q, number of queries of two types:Type 1: Given $$$q$$$, $$$i$$$, and $$$d$$$ calculate $$$F(B(q, A), K)$$$ where we make change to initial array as $$$A[i] = d$$$.Type 2: Given $$$q$$$, $$$L$$$, $$$R$$$, and $$$d$$$ calculate $$$F(B(q, A), K)$$$ where we make change to initial array as $$$A[i] = A[i] + d$$$ for all $$$i$$$ in range $$$[L, R]$$$ inclusive.All changes are temporarily made to initial array, and don't propagate to following queries.

Then follows number $$$Q$$$ ($$$Q \\\\leq 10$$$), number of queries. In the next $$$Q$$$ lines come queries of the form:1 q i d, for type 1,2 q L R d, for type 2,as explained above ($$$0 \\\\leq q, d \\\\leq 10^9, 1 \\\\leq i,L,R \\\\leq N$$$)OutputPrint $$$Q$$$ lines, the answers to queries, modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExampleInput5 2 1 2 3 4 5 3 1 6 1 1 1 6 5 2 2 6 2 3 1Output85 127 63NoteIn the first query array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], B = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], sum of products of 2-tuples = 85.In second query array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2], B = [5, 4, 3, 2, 4], sum of products of 2-tuples = 127In third query array A = [1, 3, 4, 4, 5], B = [5, 3, 2, 2, 1], sum of products of 2-tuples = 63", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e3648b01", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array $A$ of length $N$ and a number $K$. \n\nDefine a function $B(q, A)$ as follows:\n\n$B(q, A) = \\{q - a_1, q - a_2, ..., q - a_N\\}$\n\nDefine a function $F(B, K)$ as the sum of products of all $K$-tuples of elements in array $B$.\n\nYou are given $Q$ queries of two types:\n\n* **Type 1:** Given $q$, $i$, and $d$, calculate $F(B(q, A), K)$ where $A[i] = d$.\n* **Type 2:** Given $q$, $L$, $R$, and $d$, calculate $F(B(q, A), K)$ where $A[i] = A[i] + d$ for all $i$ in the range $[L, R]$ inclusive.\n\nAll changes are temporary and do not affect subsequent queries.\n\nFor each query, output the answer modulo $998244353$."}, {"prompt_md5": "25b5b60e", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given an array of numbers and a target size for groups.
