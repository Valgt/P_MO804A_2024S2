Worms Evolutiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutProfessor Vasechkin is studying evolution of worms. Recently he put forward hypotheses that all worms evolve by division. There arenforms of worms. Worms of these forms have lengthsa1,a2, ...,an. To prove his theory, professor needs to find 3 different forms that the length of the first form is equal to sum of lengths of the other two forms. Help him to do this.InputThe first line contains integern(3 ≤n≤ 100) — amount of worm's forms. The second line containsnspace-separated integersai(1 ≤ai≤ 1000) — lengths of worms of each form.OutputOutput 3 distinct integersijk(1 ≤i,j,k≤n) — such indexes of worm's forms thatai=aj+ak. If there is no such triple, output-1. If there are several solutions, output any of them. It possible thataj=ak.ExamplesInput51 2 3 5 7Output3 2 1Input51 8 1 5 1Output-1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7d523c78", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of $n$ integers ($3 \\le n \\le 100$) representing the lengths of different worm forms.
