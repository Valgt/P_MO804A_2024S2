You have to choose exactly 4 different points to build a polyline possibly with self-intersections and self-touching. This polyline should be as long as possible.A polyline defined by pointsp1,p2,p3,p4consists of the line segmentsp1p2,p2p3,p3p4, and its length is the sum of the lengths of the individual line segments.InputThe only line of the input contains two integersnandm(0 ≤n,m≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that grid contains at least 4 different points.OutputPrint 4 lines with two integers per line separated by space — coordinates of pointsp1,p2,p3,p4in order which represent the longest possible polyline.Judge program compares your answer and jury's answer with10- 6precision.ExamplesInput1 1Output1 10 01 00 1Input0 10Output0 10 100 00 9", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "69091402", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a grid of points from $(0,0)$ to $(n,m)$ inclusive.
