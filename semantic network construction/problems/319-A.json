Malek Dance Club has2nmembers and coincidentally Natalia Fan Club also has2nmembers. Each member of MDC is assigned a unique idifrom0to2n- 1. The same holds for each member of NFC.One of the parts of this tradition is one by one dance, where each member of MDC dances with a member of NFC. A dance pair is a pair of numbers(a,b)such that memberafrom MDC dances with memberbfrom NFC.The complexity of a pairs' assignment is the number of pairs of dancing pairs(a,b)and(c,d)such thata<candb>d.You are given a binary number of lengthnnamedx.
