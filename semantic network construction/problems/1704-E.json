The graph has exactly one node that has no out edges. The $$$i$$$-th node has an integer $$$a_i$$$ on it.Every second the following happens:Let $$$S$$$ be the set of nodes $$$x$$$ that have $$$a_x > 0$$$.For all $$$x \\\\in S$$$, $$$1$$$ is subtracted from $$$a_x$$$, and then for each node $$$y$$$, such that there is an edge from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$, $$$1$$$ is added to $$$a_y$$$.Find the first moment of time when all $$$a_i$$$ become $$$0$$$. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, m \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the integer on vertices.Each line of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x, y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x, y \\\\leq n$$$), represent a directed edge from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$.
