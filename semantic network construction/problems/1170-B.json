Bad Daystime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEvery day Kotlin heroes analyze the statistics of their website. For $$$n$$$ days, they wrote out $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the number of visits on the $$$i$$$-th day.They believe that a day is bad if there are at least $$$2$$$ days before it with a strictly greater number of visits. For example, if $$$n=8$$$ and $$$a=[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]$$$, then the day $$$4$$$ is bad (because $$$a_4=1$$$, but there are $$$a_1=3$$$ and $$$a_3=4$$$). Also, the day with the number $$$7$$$ is bad too.Write a program that finds the number of bad days.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$), where $$$n$$$ is the number of days. The second line contains $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the number of website visits on the $$$i$$$-th day.OutputPrint the number of bad days, i.e. such days that there are at least two days before it with a strictly greater number of visits.ExamplesInput8 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6Output2Input5 1 1 1 1 1Output0Input13 2 7 1 8 2 8 1 8 2 8 4 5 9Output6", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b2f59439", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, where each integer represents the number of website visits on a particular day.  \n\nDetermine the number of days that are considered \"bad\".
