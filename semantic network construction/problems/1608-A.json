Find Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven $$$n$$$, find any array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ of integers such that all of the following conditions hold:$$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$ for every $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.$$$a_1 < a_2 < \\\\ldots <a_n$$$For every $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$n$$$, $$$a_i$$$ isn't divisible by $$$a_{i-1}$$$It can be shown that such an array always exists under the constraints of the problem.InputThe first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.OutputFor each test case print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ â€” the array you found. If there are multiple arrays satisfying all the conditions, print any of them.ExampleInput3 1 2 7Output1 2 3 111 1111 11111 111111 1111111 11111111 111111111NoteIn the first test case, array $$$[1]$$$ satisfies all the conditions.In the second test case, array $$$[2, 3]$$$ satisfies all the conditions, as $$$2<3$$$ and $$$3$$$ is not divisible by $$$2$$$.In the third test case, array $$$[111, 1111, 11111, 111111, 1111111, 11111111, 111111111]$$$ satisfies all the conditions, as it's increasing and $$$a_i$$$ isn't divisible by $$$a_{i-1}$$$ for any $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$7$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "cdf35861", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a positive integer $n$, find a sequence of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n*  $1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$ for all $i$ from 1 to $n$.\n*  $a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n$\n*  For every $i$ from 2 to $n$, $a_i$ is not divisible by $a_{i-1}$. \n\n\n\nYou can print any sequence that works."}, {"prompt_md5": "f25bc4cc", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number *n*, find a list of *n* numbers where:\n\n* Each number is between 1 and 1 billion.\n* The numbers are in increasing order.\n* Each number is not divisible by the number before it."}]}
