Berland Minerstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe biggest gold mine in Berland consists ofncaves, connected byn- 1transitions. The entrance to the mine leads to the cave number1, it is possible to go from it to any remaining cave of the mine by moving along the transitions.The mine is being developed by the InMine Inc.,kminers work for it. Each day the corporation sorts miners into caves so that each cave has at most one miner working there.For each cave we know the height of its ceilinghiin meters, and for each miner we know his heightsj, also in meters. If a miner's height doesn't exceed the height of the cave ceiling where he is, then he can stand there comfortably, otherwise, he has to stoop and that makes him unhappy.Unfortunately, miners typically go on strike in Berland, so InMine makes all the possible effort to make miners happy about their work conditions. To ensure that no miner goes on strike, you need make sure that no miner has to stoop at any moment on his way from the entrance to the mine to his cave (in particular, he must be able to stand comfortably in the cave where he works).To reach this goal, you can choose exactly one cave and increase the height of its ceiling by several meters. However enlarging a cave is an expensive and complex procedure. That's why InMine Inc. asks you either to determine the minimum number of meters you should raise the ceiling of some cave so that it is be possible to sort the miners into the caves and keep all miners happy with their working conditions or to determine that it is impossible to achieve by raising ceiling in exactly one cave.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 5·105) — the number of caves in the mine.Then follows a line consisting ofnpositive integersh1,h2, ...,hn(1 ≤hi≤ 109), wherehiis the height of the ceiling in thei-th cave.Nextn- 1lines contain the descriptions of transitions between the caves. Each line has the formai,bi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi), whereaiandbiare the numbers of the caves connected by a path.The next line contains integerk(1 ≤k≤n).The last line containskintegerss1,s2, ...,sk(1 ≤sj≤ 109), wheresjis thej-th miner's height.OutputIn the single line print the minimum number of meters that you need to raise the ceiling by in some cave so that all miners could be sorted into caves and be happy about the work conditions. If it is impossible to do, print- 1. If it is initially possible and there's no need to raise any ceiling, print0.ExamplesInput65 8 4 6 3 121 21 34 22 56 367 4 2 5 3 11Output6Input710 14 7 12 4 50 11 22 32 45 16 51 767 3 4 8 8 10Output0Input34 2 81 21 3217 15Output-1NoteIn the first sample test we should increase ceiling height in the first cave from5to11.
