Ehab and a weird weight formulatime limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou're given a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ nodes. Every node $$$u$$$ has a weight $$$a_u$$$. It is guaranteed that there is only one node with minimum weight in the tree. For every node $$$u$$$ (except for the node with the minimum weight), it must have a neighbor $$$v$$$ such that $$$a_v<a_u$$$. You should construct a tree to minimize the weight $$$w$$$ calculated as follows:For every node $$$u$$$, $$$deg_u \\\\cdot a_u$$$ is added to $$$w$$$ ($$$deg_u$$$ is the number of edges containing node $$$u$$$).For every edge $$$\\\\{ u,v \\\\}$$$, $$$\\\\lceil log_2(dist(u,v)) \\\\rceil \\\\cdot min(a_u,a_v)$$$ is added to $$$w$$$, where $$$dist(u,v)$$$ is the number of edges in the path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ in the given tree.InputThe first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5)$$$, the number of nodes in the tree.The second line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9)$$$, the weights of the nodes.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines, each contains 2 space-separated integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le u,v \\\\le n)$$$ which means there's an edge between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.OutputOutput one integer, the minimum possible value for $$$w$$$.ExamplesInput31 2 31 21 3Output7Input54 5 3 7 81 21 33 44 5Output40NoteIn the first sample, the tree itself minimizes the value of $$$w$$$.In the second sample, the optimal tree is:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "058f683d", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ nodes, each having a weight.
