Maximums and Minimumstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ of positive integers.Find the number of pairs of indices $$$(l, r)$$$, where $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$, that pass the check. The check is performed in the following manner:The minimum and maximum numbers are found among $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\\\ldots, a_r$$$.The check is passed if the maximum number is divisible by the minimum number.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.Each test case consists of two lines.The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the number of pairs of indices that pass the check.ExampleInput61122 422 342 4 7 14716 5 18 7 7 12 14616 14 2 6 16 2Output1 3 2 7 10 19NoteBelow $$$x \\\\mid y$$$ denotes that $$$y$$$ is divisible by $$$x$$$.In the first test case, there is one pair $$$(1, 1)$$$, the maximum for this pair is $$$1$$$, the minimum is also $$$1$$$, $$$1 \\\\mid 1$$$, so the check is passed, and the answer is $$$1$$$.In the second test case, there are $$$3$$$ segments:$$$(1, 1)$$$: the maximum is $$$2$$$, the minimum is $$$2$$$, $$$2 \\\\mid 2$$$, so the check is passed.$$$(1, 2)$$$: the maximum is $$$4$$$, the minimum is $$$2$$$, $$$2 \\\\mid 4$$$, so the check is passed.$$$(2, 2)$$$: the maximum is $$$4$$$, the minimum is $$$4$$$, $$$4 \\\\mid 4$$$, so the check is passed.In the third test case, there are $$$3$$$ segments:$$$(1, 1)$$$: the maximum is $$$2$$$, the minimum is $$$2$$$, $$$2 \\\\mid 2$$$, so the check is passed.$$$(1, 2)$$$: the maximum is $$$3$$$, the minimum is $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ isn't divisible by $$$2$$$, so the check is failed.$$$(2, 2)$$$: the maximum is $$$3$$$, the minimum is $$$3$$$, $$$3 \\\\mid 3$$$, so the check is passed.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "017003a1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of positive integers.
