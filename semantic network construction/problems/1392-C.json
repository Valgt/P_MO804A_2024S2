Omkar and Waterslidetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOmkar is building a waterslide in his water park, and he needs your help to ensure that he does it as efficiently as possible.Omkar currently has $$$n$$$ supports arranged in a line, the $$$i$$$-th of which has height $$$a_i$$$. Omkar wants to build his waterslide from the right to the left, so his supports must be nondecreasing in height in order to support the waterslide. In $$$1$$$ operation, Omkar can do the following: take anycontiguous subsegmentof supports which isnondecreasing by heightsand add $$$1$$$ to each of their heights.Help Omkar find the minimum number of operations he needs to perform to make his supports able to support his waterslide!An array $$$b$$$ is a subsegment of an array $$$c$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$c$$$ by deletion of several (possibly zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly zero or all) elements from the end.An array $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ is called nondecreasing if $$$b_i\\\\le b_{i+1}$$$ for every $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of supports Omkar has.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}$$$ $$$(0 \\\\leq a_{i} \\\\leq 10^9)$$$ — the heights of the supports.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations Omkar needs to perform to make his supports able to support his waterslide.ExampleInput3 4 5 3 2 5 5 1 2 3 5 3 3 1 1 1Output3 2 0NoteThe subarray with which Omkar performs the operation is bolded.In the first test case:First operation:$$$[5, 3, \\\\textbf{2}, 5] \\\\to [5, 3, \\\\textbf{3}, 5]$$$Second operation:$$$[5, \\\\textbf{3}, \\\\textbf{3}, 5] \\\\to [5, \\\\textbf{4}, \\\\textbf{4}, 5]$$$Third operation:$$$[5, \\\\textbf{4}, \\\\textbf{4}, 5] \\\\to [5, \\\\textbf{5}, \\\\textbf{5}, 5]$$$In the third test case, the array is already nondecreasing, so Omkar does $$$0$$$ operations.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "eadfc30c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, representing the heights of supports.
