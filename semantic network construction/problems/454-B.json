Little Pony and Sort by Shifttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutOne day, Twilight Sparkle is interested in how to sort a sequence of integersa1,a2, ...,anin non-decreasing order. Being a young unicorn, the only operation she can perform is a unit shift. That is, she can move the last element of the sequence to its beginning:a1,a2, ...,an→an,a1,a2, ...,an- 1.Help Twilight Sparkle to calculate: what is the minimum number of operations that she needs to sort the sequence?InputThe first line contains an integern(2 ≤n≤ 105). The second line containsninteger numbersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 105).OutputIf it's impossible to sort the sequence output-1. Otherwise output the minimum number of operations Twilight Sparkle needs to sort it.ExamplesInput22 1Output1Input31 3 2Output-1Input21 2Output0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "efbe87a9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ integers ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$).
