Favorite Sequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp has a favorite sequence $$$a[1 \\\\dots n]$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. He wrote it out on the whiteboard as follows:he wrote the number $$$a_1$$$ to the left side (at the beginning of the whiteboard);he wrote the number $$$a_2$$$ to the right side (at the end of the whiteboard);then as far to the left as possible (but to the right from $$$a_1$$$), he wrote the number $$$a_3$$$;then as far to the right as possible (but to the left from $$$a_2$$$), he wrote the number $$$a_4$$$;Polycarp continued to act as well, until he wrote out the entire sequence on the whiteboard.The beginning of the result looks like this (of course, if $$$n \\\\ge 4$$$).For example, if $$$n=7$$$ and $$$a=[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]$$$, then Polycarp will write a sequence on the whiteboard $$$[3, 4, 5, 2, 9, 1, 1]$$$.You saw the sequence written on the whiteboard and now you want to restore Polycarp's favorite sequence.InputThe first line contains a single positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 300$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 300$$$) — the length of the sequence written on the whiteboard.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2,\\\\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the sequence written on the whiteboard.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ answers to the test cases. Each answer — is a sequence $$$a$$$ that Polycarp wrote out on the whiteboard.ExampleInput6 7 3 4 5 2 9 1 1 4 9 2 7 1 11 8 4 3 1 2 7 8 7 9 4 2 1 42 2 11 7 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1Output3 1 4 1 5 9 2  9 1 2 7  8 2 4 4 3 9 1 7 2 8 7  42  11 7  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1NoteIn the first test case, the sequence $$$a$$$ matches the sequence from the statement.
