There are $$$n$$$ — an even number — artists in the troupe. It is known whether the $$$i$$$-th artist can perform as a clown (if yes, then $$$c_i = 1$$$, otherwise $$$c_i = 0$$$), and whether they can perform as an acrobat (if yes, then $$$a_i = 1$$$, otherwise $$$a_i = 0$$$).Split the artists into two performances in such a way that:each artist plays in exactly one performance,the number of artists in the two performances is equal (i.e. equal to $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$),the number of artists that can perform as clowns in the first performance is the same as the number of artists that can perform as acrobats in the second performance.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 5\\\\,000$$$, $$$n$$$ is even) — the number of artists in the troupe.The second line contains $$$n$$$ digits $$$c_1 c_2 \\\\ldots c_n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th of which is equal to $$$1$$$ if the $$$i$$$-th artist can perform as a clown, and $$$0$$$ otherwise.The third line contains $$$n$$$ digits $$$a_1 a_2 \\\\ldots a_n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th of which is equal to $$$1$$$, if the $$$i$$$-th artist can perform as an acrobat, and $$$0$$$ otherwise.OutputPrint $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ distinct integers — the indices of the artists that should play in the first performance.If there are multiple answers, print any.If there is no solution, print a single integer $$$-1$$$.ExamplesInput4 0011 0101Output1 4Input6 000000 111111Output-1Input4 0011 1100Output4 3Input8 00100101 01111100Output1 2 3 6NoteIn the first example, one of the possible divisions into two performances is as follows: in the first performance artists $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ should take part. Then the number of artists in the first performance who can perform as clowns is equal to $$$1$$$. And the number of artists in the second performance who can perform as acrobats is $$$1$$$ as well.In the second example, the division is not possible.In the third example, one of the possible divisions is as follows: in the first performance artists $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ should take part. Then in the first performance there are $$$2$$$ artists who can perform as clowns. And the number of artists in the second performance who can perform as acrobats is $$$2$$$ as well.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9d6bb5d5", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You have an even number of people.
