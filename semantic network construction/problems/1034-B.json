Little C Loves 3 IItime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLittle C loves number «3» very much. He loves all things about it.Now he is playing a game on a chessboard of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$. The cell in the $$$x$$$-th row and in the $$$y$$$-th column is called $$$(x,y)$$$. Initially, The chessboard is empty. Each time, he places two chessmen on two different empty cells, the Manhattan distance between which is exactly $$$3$$$. The Manhattan distance between two cells $$$(x_i,y_i)$$$ and $$$(x_j,y_j)$$$ is defined as $$$|x_i-x_j|+|y_i-y_j|$$$.He want to place as many chessmen as possible on the chessboard. Please help him find the maximum number of chessmen he can place.InputA single line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n,m \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of rows and the number of columns of the chessboard.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum number of chessmen Little C can place.ExamplesInput2 2Output0Input3 3Output8NoteIn the first example, the Manhattan distance between any two cells is smaller than $$$3$$$, so the answer is $$$0$$$.In the second example, a possible solution is $$$(1,1)(3,2)$$$, $$$(1,2)(3,3)$$$, $$$(2,1)(1,3)$$$, $$$(3,1)(2,3)$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0c6e3cb8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a chessboard of size $n \\times m$.
