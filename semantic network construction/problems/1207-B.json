Square Fillingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two matrices $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$. Each matrix contains exactly $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. Each element of $$$A$$$ is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$; each element of $$$B$$$ is initially $$$0$$$.You may perform some operations with matrix $$$B$$$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $$$B$$$ having size $$$2 \\\\times 2$$$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $$$1$$$. In other words, you choose two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le x < n$$$ and $$$1 \\\\le y < m$$$, and then set $$$B_{x, y}$$$, $$$B_{x, y + 1}$$$, $$$B_{x + 1, y}$$$ and $$$B_{x + 1, y + 1}$$$ to $$$1$$$.Your goal is to make matrix $$$B$$$ equal to matrix $$$A$$$. Two matrices $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $$$A$$$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $$$B$$$.Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $$$B$$$ equal to $$$A$$$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 50$$$).Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, each containing $$$m$$$ integers. The $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$i$$$-th line is $$$A_{i, j}$$$. Each integer is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.OutputIf it is impossible to make $$$B$$$ equal to $$$A$$$, print one integer $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $$$B$$$ into $$$A$$$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $$$k$$$ â€” the number of operations, and then $$$k$$$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ for the corresponding operation (set $$$B_{x, y}$$$, $$$B_{x, y + 1}$$$, $$$B_{x + 1, y}$$$ and $$$B_{x + 1, y + 1}$$$ to $$$1$$$). The condition $$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le 2500$$$ should hold.ExamplesInput3 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1Output3 1 1 1 2 2 2Input3 3 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0Output-1Input3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0Output0NoteThe sequence of operations in the first example:$$$\\\\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \\\\rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \\\\rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\end{matrix}$$$", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ef03d8b3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two square matrices,  $A$ and $B$, both with dimensions $n \\times m$.  \n\n* Matrix $A$ has elements that are either 0 or 1.\n* Matrix $B$ has all elements initially set to 0.\n\nYou can perform the following operation on matrix $B$:\n\n1.
