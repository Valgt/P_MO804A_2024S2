We Were Both Childrentime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMihai and Slavic were looking at a group of $$$n$$$ frogs, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, all initially located at point $$$0$$$. Frog $$$i$$$ has a hop length of $$$a_i$$$.Each second, frog $$$i$$$ hops $$$a_i$$$ units forward. Before any frogs start hopping, Slavic and Mihai can placeexactly onetrap in a coordinate in order to catch all frogs that will ever pass through the corresponding coordinate.However, the children can't go far away from their home so they can only place a trap in the first $$$n$$$ points (that is, in a point with a coordinate between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$) and the children can't place a trap in point $$$0$$$ since they are scared of frogs.Can you help Slavic and Mihai find out what is the maximum number of frogs they can catch using a trap?InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of frogs, which equals the distance Slavic and Mihai can travel to place a trap.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the lengths of the hops of the corresponding frogs.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case output a single integer — the maximum number of frogs Slavic and Mihai can catch using a trap.ExampleInput751 2 3 4 532 2 263 1 3 4 9 1091 3 2 4 2 3 7 8 511087 11 6 8 12 4 4 8109 11 9 12 1 7 2 5 8 10Output3 3 3 5 0 4 4NoteIn the first test case, the frogs will hop as follows:Frog 1: $$$0 \\\\to 1 \\\\to 2 \\\\to 3 \\\\to \\\\mathbf{\\\\color{red}{4}} \\\\to \\\\cdots$$$Frog 2: $$$0 \\\\to 2 \\\\to \\\\mathbf{\\\\color{red}{4}} \\\\to 6 \\\\to 8 \\\\to \\\\cdots$$$Frog 3: $$$0 \\\\to 3 \\\\to 6 \\\\to 9 \\\\to 12 \\\\to \\\\cdots$$$Frog 4: $$$0 \\\\to \\\\mathbf{\\\\color{red}{4}} \\\\to 8 \\\\to 12 \\\\to 16 \\\\to \\\\cdots$$$Frog 5: $$$0 \\\\to 5 \\\\to 10 \\\\to 15 \\\\to 20 \\\\to \\\\cdots$$$Therefore, if Slavic and Mihai put a trap at coordinate $$$4$$$, they can catch three frogs: frogs 1, 2, and 4.
