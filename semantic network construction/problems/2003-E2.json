Turtle and Inversions (Hard Version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is a hard version of this problem. The differences between the versions are the constraint on $$$m$$$ and $$$r_i < l_{i + 1}$$$ holds for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m - 1$$$ in the easy version. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.Turtle gives you $$$m$$$ intervals $$$[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\\\ldots, [l_m, r_m]$$$. He thinks that a permutation $$$p$$$ is interesting if there exists an integer $$$k_i$$$ for every interval ($$$l_i \\\\le k_i < r_i$$$), and if he lets $$$a_i = \\\\max\\\\limits_{j = l_i}^{k_i} p_j, b_i = \\\\min\\\\limits_{j = k_i + 1}^{r_i} p_j$$$ for every integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$, the following condition holds:$$$$$$\\\\max\\\\limits_{i = 1}^m a_i < \\\\min\\\\limits_{i = 1}^m b_i$$$$$$Turtle wants you to calculate the maximum number of inversions of all interesting permutations of length $$$n$$$, or tell him if there is no interesting permutation.An inversion of a permutation $$$p$$$ is a pair of integers $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n$$$) such that $$$p_i > p_j$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^3, 0 \\\\le m \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^3$$$) — the length of the permutation and the number of intervals.The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i, r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i < r_i \\\\le n$$$) — the $$$i$$$-th interval. Note that there may exist identical intervals (i.e., there may exist two different indices $$$i, j$$$ such that $$$l_i = l_j$$$ and $$$r_i = r_j$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^3$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^3$$$.OutputFor each test case, if there is no interesting permutation, output a single integer $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, output a single integer — the maximum number of inversions.ExampleInput82 02 11 25 12 48 31 42 57 87 21 44 77 31 21 73 77 41 34 71 34 77 31 23 45 6Output1 0 8 18 -1 -1 15 15NoteIn the third test case, the interesting permutation with the maximum number of inversions is $$$[5, 2, 4, 3, 1]$$$.In the fourth test case, the interesting permutation with the maximum number of inversions is $$$[4, 3, 8, 7, 6, 2, 1, 5]$$$.
