Task On The Boardtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp wrote on the board a string $$$s$$$ containing only lowercase Latin letters ('a'-'z'). This string is known for you and given in the input.After that, he erased some letters from the string $$$s$$$, and he rewrote the remaining letters inanyorder. As a result, he got some new string $$$t$$$. You have to find it with some additional information.Suppose that the string $$$t$$$ has length $$$m$$$ and the characters are numbered from left to right from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. You are given a sequence of $$$m$$$ integers: $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_m$$$, where $$$b_i$$$ is the sum of the distances $$$|i-j|$$$ from the index $$$i$$$ to all such indices $$$j$$$ that $$$t_j > t_i$$$ (consider that 'a'<'b'<...<'z'). In other words, to calculate $$$b_i$$$, Polycarp finds all such indices $$$j$$$ that the index $$$j$$$ contains a letter that is later in the alphabet than $$$t_i$$$ and sums all the values $$$|i-j|$$$.For example, if $$$t$$$ = \"abzb\", then:since $$$t_1$$$='a', all other indices contain letters which are later in the alphabet, that is: $$$b_1=|1-2|+|1-3|+|1-4|=1+2+3=6$$$;since $$$t_2$$$='b', only the index $$$j=3$$$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $$$b_2=|2-3|=1$$$;since $$$t_3$$$='z', then there are no indexes $$$j$$$ such that $$$t_j>t_i$$$, thus $$$b_3=0$$$;since $$$t_4$$$='b', only the index $$$j=3$$$ contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is: $$$b_4=|4-3|=1$$$.Thus, if $$$t$$$ = \"abzb\", then $$$b=[6,1,0,1]$$$.Given the string $$$s$$$ and the array $$$b$$$, find any possible string $$$t$$$ for which the following two requirements are fulfilled simultaneously:$$$t$$$ is obtained from $$$s$$$ by erasing some letters (possibly zero) and then writing the rest inanyorder;the array, constructed from the string $$$t$$$ according to the rules above, equals to the array $$$b$$$ specified in the input data.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $$$q$$$ test cases follow.Each test case consists of three lines:the first line contains string $$$s$$$, which has a length from $$$1$$$ to $$$50$$$ and consists of lowercase English letters;the second line contains positive integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le |s|$$$), where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$, and $$$m$$$ is the length of the array $$$b$$$;the third line contains the integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_m$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 1225$$$).It is guaranteed that in each test case an answer exists.OutputOutput $$$q$$$ lines: the $$$k$$$-th of them should contain the answer (string $$$t$$$) to the $$$k$$$-th test case. It is guaranteed that an answer to each test case exists. If there are several answers, output any.ExampleInput4 abac 3 2 1 0 abc 1 0 abba 3 1 0 1 ecoosdcefr 10 38 13 24 14 11 5 3 24 17 0Outputaac b aba codeforcesNoteIn the first test case, such strings $$$t$$$ are suitable: \"aac', \"aab\".In the second test case, such trings $$$t$$$ are suitable: \"a\", \"b\", \"c\".In the third test case, only the string $$$t$$$ equals to \"aba\" is suitable, but the character 'b' can be from the second or third position.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b33bf101", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string $s$ and an array $b$ of length $m$.
