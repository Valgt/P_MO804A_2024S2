Then for each sequence written on the squared paper, Sereja wrote on a piece of lines paper all sequences thatdo not exceedit.A sequence of positive integersx=x1,x2, ...,xrdoesn't exceed a sequence of positive integersy=y1,y2, ...,yr, if the following inequation holds:x1≤y1,x2≤y2, ...,xr≤yr.Now Sereja wonders, how many sequences are written on the lines piece of paper.
