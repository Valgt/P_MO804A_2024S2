Iris's Full Binary Treetime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIris likes full binary trees.Let's define the depth of a rooted tree as the maximum number ofverticeson the simple paths from some vertex to the root. A full binary tree of depth $$$d$$$ is a binary tree of depth $$$d$$$ with exactly $$$2^d - 1$$$ vertices.Iris calls a tree a$$$d$$$-binarytree if some vertices and edges can beaddedto it to make it a full binary tree of depth $$$d$$$. Note thatany vertexcan be chosen as the root of a full binary tree.Since performing operations on large trees is difficult, she defines thebinary depthof a tree as the minimum $$$d$$$ satisfying that the tree is $$$d$$$-binary. Specifically, if there is no integer $$$d \\\\ge 1$$$ such that the tree is $$$d$$$-binary, the binary depth of the tree is $$$-1$$$.Iris now has a tree consisting of only vertex $$$1$$$. She wants to add $$$n - 1$$$ more vertices to form a larger tree. She will add the vertices one by one. When she adds vertex $$$i$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$), she'll give you an integer $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq p_i < i$$$), and add a new edge connecting vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$p_i$$$.Iris wants to ask you the binary depth of the tree formed by the first $$$i$$$ vertices for each $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$. Can you tell her the answer?InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the final size of the tree.The second line of each test case contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq p_i < i$$$) — descriptions of all edges of the tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case output $$$n$$$ integers, $$$i$$$-th of them representing the binary depth of the tree formed by the first $$$i$$$ vertices.ExampleInput731 161 2 3 4 571 1 3 2 5 1101 1 2 1 4 2 4 5 8101 1 3 1 3 2 2 2 6201 1 2 2 4 4 5 5 7 6 8 6 11 14 11 8 13 13 12251 1 3 3 1 5 4 4 6 8 11 12 8 7 11 13 7 13 15 6 19 14 10 23Output1 2 2  1 2 2 3 3 4  1 2 2 3 3 4 4  1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 5  1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 -1 -1  1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 7  1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 8 8NoteIn the first test case, the final tree is shown below:The tree consisting of the vertex $$$1$$$ has the binary depth $$$1$$$ (the tree itself is a full binary tree of depth $$$1$$$).The tree consisting of the vertices $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ has the binary depth $$$2$$$ (we can add the vertex $$$3$$$ to make it a full binary tree of depth $$$2$$$).The tree consisting of the vertices $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ has the binary depth $$$2$$$ (the tree itself is a full binary tree of depth $$$2$$$).In the second test case, the formed full binary tree after adding some vertices to the tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices is shown below (bolded vertices are added):The depth of the formed full binary tree is $$$4$$$.In the fifth test case, the final tree is shown below:It can be proved that Iris can't form any full binary tree by adding vertices and edges, so the binary depth is $$$-1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ffc1836e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of integers $p_2, p_3, ..., p_n$ where $1 \\leq p_i < i$.
