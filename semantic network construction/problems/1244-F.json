Chipstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ chips arranged in a circle, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.Initially each chip has black or white color. Then $$$k$$$ iterations occur. During each iteration the chips change their colors according to the following rules. For each chip $$$i$$$, three chips are considered: chip $$$i$$$ itself and two its neighbours. If the number of white chips among these three is greater than the number of black chips among these three chips, then the chip $$$i$$$ becomes white. Otherwise, the chip $$$i$$$ becomes black.Note that for each $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$(n - 1)$$$ two neighbouring chips have numbers $$$(i - 1)$$$ and $$$(i + 1)$$$. The neighbours for the chip $$$i = 1$$$ are $$$n$$$ and $$$2$$$. The neighbours of $$$i = n$$$ are $$$(n - 1)$$$ and $$$1$$$.The following picture describes one iteration with $$$n = 6$$$. The chips $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ are initially black, and the chips $$$2$$$, $$$5$$$ and $$$6$$$ are white. After the iteration $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ become black, and $$$1$$$, $$$5$$$ and $$$6$$$ become white.Your task is to determine the color of each chip after $$$k$$$ iterations.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(3 \\\\le n \\\\le 200\\\\,000, 1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^{9})$$$ â€” the number of chips and the number of iterations, respectively.The second line contains a string consisting of $$$n$$$ characters \"W\" and \"B\". If the $$$i$$$-th character is \"W\", then the $$$i$$$-th chip is white initially. If the $$$i$$$-th character is \"B\", then the $$$i$$$-th chip is black initially.OutputPrint a string consisting of $$$n$$$ characters \"W\" and \"B\". If after $$$k$$$ iterations the $$$i$$$-th chip is white, then the $$$i$$$-th character should be \"W\". Otherwise the $$$i$$$-th character should be \"B\".ExamplesInput6 1 BWBBWWOutputWBBBWWInput7 3 WBWBWBWOutputWWWWWWWInput6 4 BWBWBWOutputBWBWBWNoteThe first example is described in the statement.The second example: \"WBWBWBW\" $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ \"WWBWBWW\" $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ \"WWWBWWW\" $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ \"WWWWWWW\".
