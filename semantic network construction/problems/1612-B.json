Special Permutationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array $$$p=[p_1,p_2,\\\\dots, p_n]$$$ which contains every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (inclusive) exactly once. For example, $$$p=[4, 2, 6, 5, 3, 1]$$$ is a permutation of length $$$6$$$.You are given three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, where $$$n$$$ is an even number. Print any permutation of length $$$n$$$ that the minimum amongall its elements of the left halfequals $$$a$$$ and the maximum amongall its elements of the right halfequals $$$b$$$. Print-1if no such permutation exists.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$), the number of test cases in the test. The following $$$t$$$ lines contain test case descriptions.Each test case description contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$; $$$1 \\\\le a,b \\\\le n$$$; $$$a \\\\ne b$$$), where $$$n$$$ is an even number (i.e. $$$n \\\\bmod 2 = 0$$$).OutputFor each test case, print a single line containing any suitable permutation. Print-1no such permutation exists. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExampleInput7 6 2 5 6 1 3 6 4 3 4 2 4 10 5 3 2 1 2 2 2 1Output4 2 6 5 3 1 -1 6 4 5 1 3 2  3 2 4 1  -1 1 2  2 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e452d36d", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given an even number and two smaller numbers.
