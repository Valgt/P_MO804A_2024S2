Fun with Even Subarraystime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements. You can apply the following operation to it any number of times:Select some subarray from $$$a$$$ of even size $$$2k$$$ that begins at position $$$l$$$ ($$$1\\\\le l \\\\le l+2\\\\cdot{k}-1\\\\le n$$$, $$$k \\\\ge 1$$$) and for each $$$i$$$ between $$$0$$$ and $$$k-1$$$ (inclusive), assign the value $$$a_{l+k+i}$$$ to $$$a_{l+i}$$$.For example, if $$$a = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 3]$$$, then choose $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$k = 2$$$, applying this operation the array will become $$$a = [3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 3]$$$.Find the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make all the elements of the array equal.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case consists of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case — the minimum number of operations needed to make equal all the elements of the array with the given operation.ExampleInput531 1 122 154 4 4 2 444 2 1 311Output0 1 1 2 0NoteIn the first test, all elements are equal, therefore no operations are needed.In the second test, you can apply one operation with $$$k=1$$$ and $$$l=1$$$, set $$$a_1 := a_2$$$, and the array becomes $$$[1, 1]$$$ with $$$1$$$ operation.In the third test, you can apply one operation with $$$k=1$$$ and $$$l=4$$$, set $$$a_4 := a_5$$$, and the array becomes $$$[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]$$$.In the fourth test, you can apply one operation with $$$k=1$$$ and $$$l=3$$$, set $$$a_3 := a_4$$$, and the array becomes $$$[4, 2, 3, 3]$$$, then you can apply another operation with $$$k=2$$$ and $$$l=1$$$, set $$$a_1 := a_3$$$, $$$a_2 := a_4$$$, and the array becomes $$$[3, 3, 3, 3]$$$.In the fifth test, there is only one element, therefore no operations are needed.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9f5d8a32", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
