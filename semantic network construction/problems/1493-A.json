Anti-knapsacktime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. You are asked to choose maximum number of distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ so that there is no subset of chosen numbers with sum equal to $$$k$$$.A subset of a set is a set that can be obtained from initial one by removing some (possibly all or none) elements of it.InputThe first line contains the number of test cases $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 100$$$).Each of the next $$$T$$$ lines contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$) — the description of test cases.OutputFor each test case output two lines. In the first line output a single integer $$$m$$$ — the number of chosen integers.In the second line output $$$m$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ — the chosen numbers.If there are multiple answers, print any. You can print the numbers in any order.ExampleInput3 3 2 5 3 1 1Output2 3 1  3 4 5 2  0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8a933157", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two numbers, $n$ and $k$.
