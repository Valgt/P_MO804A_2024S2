Yet Another Problem On a Subsequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_k$$$ is called a good array if $$$a_1 = k - 1$$$ and $$$a_1 > 0$$$. For example, the sequences $$$[3, -1, 44, 0], [1, -99]$$$ are good arrays, and the sequences $$$[3, 7, 8], [2, 5, 4, 1], [0]$$$ — are not.A sequence of integers is called good if it can be divided into a positive number of good arrays. Each good array should be a subsegment of sequence and each element of the sequence should belong to exactly one array. For example, the sequences $$$[2, -3, 0, 1, 4]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 3, -3, -9, 4]$$$ are good, and the sequences $$$[2, -3, 0, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 3, -3 -9, 4, 1]$$$ — are not.For a given sequence of numbers, count the number of itssubsequencesthat are good sequences, and print the number of such subsequences modulo998244353.InputThe first line contains the number $$$n~(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^3)$$$ — the length of the initial sequence.
