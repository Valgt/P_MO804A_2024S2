Binary Matrixtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test16 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a matrix of sizen×m. Each element of the matrix is either 1 or 0. You have to determine the number of connected components consisting of 1's. Two cells belong to the same component if they have a common border, and both elements in these cells are 1's.Note that the memory limit is unusual!InputThe first line contains two numbersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 212,4 ≤m≤ 214) — the number of rows and columns, respectively. It is guaranteed thatmis divisible by 4.Then the representation of matrix follows. Each ofnnext lines containsone-digit hexadecimal numbers (that is, these numbers can be represented either as digits from0to9or as uppercase Latin letters fromAtoF). Binary representation of each of these numbers denotes next4elements of the matrix in the corresponding row. For example, if the numberBis given, then the corresponding elements are1011, and if the number is5, then the corresponding elements are0101.Elements are not separated by whitespaces.OutputPrint the number of connected components consisting of 1's.ExamplesInput3 41A8Output3Input2 85FE3Output2Input1 40Output0NoteIn the first example the matrix is:000110101000It is clear that it has three components.The second example:0101111111100011It is clear that the number of components is 2.There are no 1's in the third example, so the answer is 0.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "067772a7", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a matrix of size $n \\times m$.
