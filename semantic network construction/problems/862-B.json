Mahmoud and Ehab and the bipartitenesstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMahmoud and Ehab continue their adventures! As everybody in the evil land knows, Dr. Evil likes bipartite graphs, especially trees.A tree is a connected acyclic graph. A bipartite graph is a graph, whose vertices can be partitioned into2sets in such a way, that for each edge(u,v)that belongs to the graph,uandvbelong to different sets. You can find more formal definitions of a tree and a bipartite graph in the notes section below.Dr. Evil gave Mahmoud and Ehab a tree consisting ofnnodes and asked them to add edges to it in such a way, that the graph is still bipartite. Besides, after adding these edges the graph should be simple (doesn't contain loops or multiple edges). What is the maximum number of edges they can add?A loop is an edge, which connects a node with itself. Graph doesn't contain multiple edges when for each pair of nodes there is no more than one edge between them.A cycle and a loop aren't the same.InputThe first line of input contains an integern— the number of nodes in the tree (1 ≤n≤ 105).The nextn- 1lines contain integersuandv(1 ≤u,v≤n,u≠v) — the description of the edges of the tree.It's guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.OutputOutput one integer — the maximum number of edges that Mahmoud and Ehab can add to the tree while fulfilling the conditions.ExamplesInput31 21 3Output0Input51 22 33 44 5Output2NoteTree definition:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)Bipartite graph definition:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graphIn the first test case the only edge that can be added in such a way, that graph won't contain loops or multiple edges is(2, 3), but adding this edge will make the graph non-bipartite so the answer is 0.In the second test case Mahmoud and Ehab can add edges(1, 4)and(2, 5).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8a6f88f6", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ nodes.
