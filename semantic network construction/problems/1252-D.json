Find String in a Gridtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a grid $$$G$$$ containing $$$R$$$ rows (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$R$$$, top to bottom) and $$$C$$$ columns (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$C$$$, left to right) of uppercase characters. The character in the $$$r^{th}$$$ row and the $$$c^{th}$$$ column is denoted by $$$G_{r, c}$$$. You also have $$$Q$$$ strings containing uppercase characters. For each of the string, you want to find the number of occurrences of the string in the grid.An occurrence of string $$$S$$$ in the grid is counted if $$$S$$$ can be constructed by starting at one of the cells in the grid, going right $$$0$$$ or more times, and then going down $$$0$$$ or more times. Two occurrences are different if the set of cells used to construct the string is different. Formally, for each string $$$S$$$, you would like to count the number of tuples $$$\\\\langle r, c, \\\\Delta r, \\\\Delta c \\\\rangle$$$ such that:$$$1 \\\\le r \\\\le R$$$ and $$$r \\\\le r + \\\\Delta r \\\\le R$$$$$$1 \\\\le c \\\\le C$$$ and $$$c \\\\le c + \\\\Delta c \\\\le C$$$$$$S = G_{r, c} G_{r, c + 1} \\\\dots G_{r, c + \\\\Delta c} G_{r + 1, c + \\\\Delta c} \\\\dots G_{r + \\\\Delta r, c + \\\\Delta c}$$$InputInput begins with a line containing three integers: $$$R$$$ $$$C$$$ $$$Q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le R, C \\\\le 500$$$; $$$1 \\\\le Q \\\\le 200\\\\,000$$$) representing the size of the grid and the number of strings, respectively. The next $$$R$$$ lines each contains $$$C$$$ uppercase characters representing the grid. The $$$c^{th}$$$ character on the $$$r^{th}$$$ line is $$$G_{r, c}$$$. The next $$$Q$$$ lines each contains a string $$$S$$$ containing uppercase characters. The length of this string is a positive integer not more than $$$200\\\\,000$$$. The sum of the length of all $$$Q$$$ strings combined is not more than $$$200\\\\,000$$$.OutputFor each query in the same order as input, output in a line an integer representing the number of occurrences of the string in the grid.ExamplesInput3 3 5 ABC BCD DAB ABC BC BD AC AOutput2 3 1 0 2Input2 3 3 AAA AAA A AAA AAAAAOutput6 4 0NoteExplanation for the sample input/output #1There are $$$2$$$ occurrences of \"ABC\", represented by the tuples $$$\\\\langle 1, 1, 1, 1 \\\\rangle$$$ and $$$\\\\langle 1, 1, 0, 2 \\\\rangle$$$.There are $$$3$$$ occurrences of \"BC\", represented by the tuples $$$\\\\langle 1, 2, 0, 1 \\\\rangle$$$, $$$\\\\langle 1, 2, 1, 0 \\\\rangle$$$, and $$$\\\\langle 2, 1, 0, 1 \\\\rangle$$$.There is $$$1$$$ occurrence of \"BD\", represented by the tuple $$$\\\\langle 2, 1, 1, 0 \\\\rangle$$$.There is no occurrence of \"AC\".There are $$$2$$$ occurrences of \"A\", represented by the tuples $$$\\\\langle 1, 1, 0, 0 \\\\rangle$$$ and $$$\\\\langle 3, 2, 0, 0 \\\\rangle$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c0b0a780", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a grid of uppercase letters.
