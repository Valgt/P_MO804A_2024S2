Div Times Modtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya likes to solve equations. Today he wants to solve $$$(x~\\\\mathrm{div}~k) \\\\cdot (x \\\\bmod k) = n$$$, where $$$\\\\mathrm{div}$$$ and $$$\\\\mathrm{mod}$$$ stand for integer division and modulo operations (refer to the Notes below for exact definition). In this equation, $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$ are positive integer parameters, and $$$x$$$ is a positive integer unknown. If there are several solutions, Vasya wants to find the smallest possible $$$x$$$. Can you help him?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^6$$$, $$$2 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 1000$$$).OutputPrint a single integer $$$x$$$ — the smallest positive integer solution to $$$(x~\\\\mathrm{div}~k) \\\\cdot (x \\\\bmod k) = n$$$. It is guaranteed that this equation has at least one positive integer solution.ExamplesInput6 3Output11Input1 2Output3Input4 6Output10NoteThe result of integer division $$$a~\\\\mathrm{div}~b$$$ is equal to the largest integer $$$c$$$ such that $$$b \\\\cdot c \\\\leq a$$$. $$$a$$$ modulo $$$b$$$ (shortened $$$a \\\\bmod b$$$) is the only integer $$$c$$$ such that $$$0 \\\\leq c < b$$$, and $$$a - c$$$ is divisible by $$$b$$$.In the first sample, $$$11~\\\\mathrm{div}~3 = 3$$$ and $$$11 \\\\bmod 3 = 2$$$. Since $$$3 \\\\cdot 2 = 6$$$, then $$$x = 11$$$ is a solution to $$$(x~\\\\mathrm{div}~3) \\\\cdot (x \\\\bmod 3) = 6$$$. One can see that $$$19$$$ is the only other positive integer solution, hence $$$11$$$ is the smallest one.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b1089a37", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given two positive integers $n$ and $k$, find the smallest positive integer $x$ that satisfies the equation:\n\n$$(x \\div k) \\cdot (x \\bmod k) = n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n*  $a \\div b$ represents the integer division of $a$ by $b$ (the largest whole number less than or equal to $a/b$).\n*  $a \\bmod b$ represents the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$. \n\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one positive integer solution exists."}, {"prompt_md5": "c3de3b99", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the following equation: (x divided by k) * (x modulo k) = n."}]}
