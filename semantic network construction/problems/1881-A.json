Note that the value of $$$x$$$ will change after this.For example, if $$$x =$$$\"aba\", then after applying operations, $$$x$$$ will change as follows: \"aba\" $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ \"abaaba\" $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ \"abaabaabaaba\".After whatminimumnumber of operations $$$s$$$ will appear in $$$x$$$ as a substring? A substring of a string is defined as acontiguoussegment of it.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\cdot m \\\\le 25$$$) — the lengths of strings $$$x$$$ and $$$s$$$, respectively.The second line of each test case contains the string $$$x$$$ of length $$$n$$$.The third line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$m$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single number — theminimumnumber of operations after which $$$s$$$ will appear in $$$x$$$ as a substring.
