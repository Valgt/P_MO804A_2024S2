Road Constructiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutA country hasncities. Initially, there is no road in the country. One day, the king decides to construct some roads connecting pairs of cities. Roads can be traversed either way. He wants those roads to be constructed in such a way that it is possible to go from each city to any other city by traversing at most two roads. You are also givenmpairs of cities — roads cannot be constructed between these pairs of cities.Your task is to construct the minimum number of roads that still satisfy the above conditions. The constraints will guarantee that this is always possible.InputThe first line consists of two integersnandm.Thenmlines follow, each consisting of two integersaiandbi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi), which means that it is not possible to construct a road connecting citiesaiandbi. Consider the cities are numbered from 1 ton.It is guaranteed that every pair of cities will appear at most once in the input.OutputYou should print an integers: the minimum number of roads that should be constructed, in the first line. Thenslines should follow, each consisting of two integersaiandbi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi), which means that a road should be constructed between citiesaiandbi.If there are several solutions, you may print any of them.ExamplesInput4 11 3Output31 24 22 3NoteThis is one possible solution of the example:These are examples of wrong solutions:The above solution is wrong because it doesn't use the minimum number of edges (4vs3). In addition, it also tries to construct a road between cities1and3, while the input specifies that it is not allowed to construct a road between the pair.The above solution is wrong because you need to traverse at least3roads to go from city1to city3, whereas in your country it must be possible to go from any city to another by traversing at most2roads.Finally, the above solution is wrong because it must be possible to go from any city to another, whereas it is not possible in this country to go from city1to3,2to3, and4to3.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ff100edf", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of cities and a list of city pairs that cannot be connected by a road.
