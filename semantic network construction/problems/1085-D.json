Minimum Diameter Treetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree (an undirected connected graph without cycles) and an integer $$$s$$$.Vanya wants to put weights on all edges of the tree so that all weights are non-negative real numbers and their sum is $$$s$$$. At the same time, he wants to make the diameter of the tree as small as possible.Let's define the diameter of a weighed tree as the maximum sum of the weights of the edges lying on the path between two some vertices of the tree. In other words, the diameter of a weighed tree is the length of the longest simple path in the tree, where length of a path is equal to the sum of weights over all edges in the path.Find the minimum possible diameter that Vanya can get.InputThe first line contains two integer numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq s \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the sum of edge weights.Each of the following $$$n−1$$$ lines contains two space-separated integer numbers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i, b_i \\\\leq n$$$, $$$a_i \\\\neq b_i$$$) — the indexes of vertices connected by an edge. The edges are undirected.It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.OutputPrint the minimum diameter of the tree that Vanya can get by placing some non-negative real weights on its edges with the sum equal to $$$s$$$.Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is considered correct if $$$\\\\frac {|a-b|} {max(1, b)} \\\\leq 10^{-6}$$$.ExamplesInput4 3 1 2 1 3 1 4Output2.000000000000000000Input6 1 2 1 2 3 2 5 5 4 5 6Output0.500000000000000000Input5 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 3 5Output3.333333333333333333NoteIn the first example it is necessary to put weights like this:It is easy to see that the diameter of this tree is $$$2$$$.
