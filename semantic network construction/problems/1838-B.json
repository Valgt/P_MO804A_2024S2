Minimize Permutation Subarraystime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$. You want to minimize the number of subarrays of $$$p$$$ that are permutations. In order to do so, you must perform the following operationexactlyonce:Select integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, where $$$1 \\\\le i, j \\\\le n$$$, thenSwap $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$.For example, if $$$p = [5, 1, 4, 2, 3]$$$ and we choose $$$i = 2$$$, $$$j = 3$$$, the resulting array will be $$$[5, 4, 1, 2, 3]$$$. If instead we choose $$$i = j = 5$$$, the resulting array will be $$$[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]$$$.Which choice of $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ will minimize the number of subarrays that are permutations?A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).An array $$$a$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the permutation.The next line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$, all $$$p_i$$$ are distinct) — the elements of the permutation $$$p$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i, j \\\\le n$$$)  — the indices to swap in $$$p$$$.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.ExampleInput831 2 331 3 251 3 2 5 464 5 6 1 2 398 7 6 3 2 1 4 5 9107 10 5 1 9 8 3 2 6 4108 5 10 9 2 1 3 4 6 7102 3 5 7 10 1 8 6 4 9Output2 3 1 1 5 2 1 4 9 5 8 8 6 10 5 4NoteFor the first test case, there are four possible arrays after the swap:If we swap $$$p_1$$$ and $$$p_2$$$, we get the array $$$[2, 1, 3]$$$, which has 3 subarrays that are permutations ($$$[1]$$$, $$$[2, 1]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 3]$$$).If we swap $$$p_1$$$ and $$$p_3$$$, we get the array $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$, which has 3 subarrays that are permutations ($$$[1]$$$, $$$[2, 1]$$$, $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$).If we swap $$$p_2$$$ and $$$p_3$$$, we get the array $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$, which has 2 subarrays that are permutations ($$$[1]$$$, $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$).If we swap any element with itself, we get the array $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, which has 3 subarrays that are permutations ($$$[1]$$$, $$$[1, 2]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$).So the best swap to make is positions $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$.For the third sample case, after we swap elements at positions $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$, the resulting array is $$$[1, 4, 2, 5, 3]$$$. The only subarrays that are permutations are $$$[1]$$$ and $$$[1, 4, 2, 5, 3]$$$.

A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within a larger array. \n\n\nFor example, if the permutation is $[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]$, swapping elements at positions 2 and 3 would result in $[5, 4, 1, 2, 3]$."}]}
