Reversetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You have to choose two integers $$$l,r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$) and reverse the subsegment $$$[l,r]$$$ of the permutation. The permutation will become $$$p_1,p_2, \\\\dots, p_{l-1},p_r,p_{r-1}, \\\\dots, p_l,p_{r+1},p_{r+2}, \\\\dots ,p_n$$$.Find the lexicographically smallest permutation that can be obtained by performingexactlyone reverse operation on the initial permutation.Note that for two distinct permutations of equal length $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$b$$$ if at the first position they differ, $$$a$$$ has the smaller element.A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 500$$$) — the length of the permutation.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$) — the elements of the permutation.OutputFor each test case print the lexicographically smallest permutation you can obtain.ExampleInput41132 1 341 4 2 351 2 3 4 5Output1  1 2 3  1 2 4 3  1 2 3 4 5NoteIn the first test case, the permutation has length $$$1$$$, so the only possible segment is $$$[1,1]$$$. The resulting permutation is $$$[1]$$$.In the second test case, we can obtain the identity permutation by reversing the segment $$$[1,2]$$$. The resulting permutation is $$$[1,2,3]$$$.In the third test case, the best possible segment is $$$[2,3]$$$. The resulting permutation is $$$[1,2,4,3]$$$.In the fourth test case, there is no lexicographically smaller permutation, so we can leave it unchanged by choosing the segment $$$[1,1]$$$. The resulting permutation is $$$[1,2,3,4,5]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7919b296", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to $n$.
