Array Equalizertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputJeevan has two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$. He is fond of performing weird operations on arrays. This time, he comes up with two types of operations:Choose any $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$) and increment $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$ for every $$$j$$$ which is a multiple of $$$i$$$ and $$$1 \\\\le j \\\\le n$$$.Choose any $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$) and decrement $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$ for every $$$j$$$ which is a multiple of $$$i$$$ and $$$1 \\\\le j \\\\le n$$$.He wants to convert array $$$a$$$ into an array $$$b$$$ using the minimum total number of operations. However, Jeevan seems to have forgotten the value of $$$b_1$$$. So he makes some guesses. He will ask you $$$q$$$ questions corresponding to his $$$q$$$ guesses, the $$$i$$$-th of which is of the form:If $$$b_1 = x_i$$$, what is the minimum number of operations required to convert $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$?Help him by answering each question.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^{5})$$$  — the size of arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6)$$$.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 10^6$$$ for $$$i \\\\neq 1$$$; $$$b_1 = -1$$$, representing that the value of $$$b_1$$$ is unknown$$$)$$$.The fourth line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^{5})$$$  — the number of questions.Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$x_i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le x_i \\\\le 10^6)$$$  — representing the $$$i$$$-th question.OutputOutput $$$q$$$ integers  — the answers to each of his $$$q$$$ questions.ExamplesInput2 3 7 -1 5 3 1 4 3Output2 4 2Input6 2 5 4 1 3 6 -1 4 6 2 3 5 3 1 8 4Output10 29 9NoteConsider the first test case.$$$b_1 = 1$$$: We need to convert $$$[3, 7] \\\\rightarrow [1, 5]$$$.
