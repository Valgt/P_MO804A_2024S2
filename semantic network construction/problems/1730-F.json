Almost Sortedtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a positive integer $$$k$$$. Consider a permutation $$$q$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that for any integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, where $$$1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n$$$, we have $$$$$$p_{q_i} \\\\le p_{q_j} + k.$$$$$$Find the minimum possible number of inversions in a permutation $$$q$$$.A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).An inversion in a permutation $$$a$$$ is a pair of indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i, j \\\\le n$$$) such that $$$i < j$$$, but $$$a_i > a_j$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5000$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 8$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$).OutputPrint the minimum possible number of inversions in the permutation $$$q$$$.ExamplesInput1 1 1Output0Input3 1 2 3 1Output1Input5 2 5 4 3 2 1Output6Input10 3 5 8 6 10 2 7 4 1 9 3Output18NoteIn the first example, the only permutation is $$$q = [1]$$$ ($$$0$$$ inversions).
