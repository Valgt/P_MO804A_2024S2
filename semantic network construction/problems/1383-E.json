Then Koa deletes position $$$i+1$$$ from $$$s$$$ (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated).Note that after every operation the length of $$$s$$$ decreases by $$$1$$$.How many different binary strings can Koa obtain by doing no more than $$$n-1$$$ (possibly zero) operations modulo $$$10^9+7$$$ ($$$1000000007$$$)?InputThe only line of input contains binary string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 10^6$$$).
