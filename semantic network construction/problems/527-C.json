Glass Carvingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLeonid wants to become a glass carver (the person who creates beautiful artworks by cutting the glass). He already has a rectangularwmm×hmm sheet of glass, a diamond glass cutter and lots of enthusiasm. What he lacks is understanding of what to carve and how.In order not to waste time, he decided to practice the technique of carving. To do this, he makes vertical and horizontal cuts through the entire sheet. This process results in making smaller rectangular fragments of glass. Leonid does not move the newly made glass fragments. In particular, a cut divides each fragment of glass that it goes through into smaller fragments.After each cut Leonid tries to determine what area the largest of the currently available glass fragments has. Since there appear more and more fragments, this question takes him more and more time and distracts him from the fascinating process.Leonid offers to divide the labor — he will cut glass, and you will calculate the area of the maximum fragment after each cut. Do you agree?InputThe first line contains three integersw,h,n(2 ≤w,h≤ 200 000,1 ≤n≤ 200 000).Nextnlines contain the descriptions of the cuts. Each description has the formHyorVx. In the first case Leonid makes the horizontal cut at the distanceymillimeters (1 ≤y≤h- 1) from the lower edge of the original sheet of glass. In the second case Leonid makes a vertical cut at distancex(1 ≤x≤w- 1) millimeters from the left edge of the original sheet of glass. It is guaranteed that Leonid won't make two identical cuts.OutputAfter each cut print on a single line the area of the maximum available glass fragment in mm2.ExamplesInput4 3 4H 2V 2V 3V 1Output8442Input7 6 5H 4V 3V 5H 2V 1Output28161264NotePicture for the first sample test:Picture for the second sample test:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c29f0f22", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a rectangular piece of glass with dimensions $w \\times h$.  \n\nThe goal is to determine the area of the largest remaining piece of glass after a series of horizontal and vertical cuts.\n\nEach cut is described by either:\n\n*  $H y$ : a horizontal cut at distance $y$ from the bottom edge.\n*  $V x$ : a vertical cut at distance $x$ from the left edge.\n\nAfter each cut, calculate the area of the largest remaining piece of glass. \n\n**Input:**\n\n* The first line contains three integers: $w$, $h$, and $n$ (the width, height, and number of cuts).\n* The next $n$ lines each contain a cut description (either $H y$ or $V x$).\n\n**Output:**\n\n* After each cut, print the area of the largest remaining piece of glass."}, {"prompt_md5": "c51c70ea", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a rectangular piece of material.
