When Igor entered the classroom there was an integer $$$x$$$ written on the blackboard.Igor generated sequence $$$p$$$ using the following algorithm:initially, $$$p = [x]$$$;for each $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$ he did the following operation $$$|d_i|$$$ times:if $$$d_i \\\\geq 0$$$, then he looked at the last element of $$$p$$$ (let it be $$$y$$$) and appended $$$y + 1$$$ to the end of $$$p$$$;if $$$d_i < 0$$$, then he looked at the last element of $$$p$$$ (let it be $$$y$$$) and appended $$$y - 1$$$ to the end of $$$p$$$.For example, if $$$x = 3$$$, and $$$d = [1, -1, 2]$$$, $$$p$$$ will be equal $$$[3, 4, 3, 4, 5]$$$.Igor decided to calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence of $$$p$$$ and the number of them.A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.A sequence $$$a$$$ is an increasing sequence if each element of $$$a$$$ (except the first one) is strictly greater than the previous element.For $$$p = [3, 4, 3, 4, 5]$$$, the length of longest increasing subsequence is $$$3$$$ and there are $$$3$$$ of them: $$$[\\\\underline{3}, \\\\underline{4}, 3, 4, \\\\underline{5}]$$$, $$$[\\\\underline{3}, 4, 3, \\\\underline{4}, \\\\underline{5}]$$$, $$$[3, 4, \\\\underline{3}, \\\\underline{4}, \\\\underline{5}]$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 50$$$) — the length of the sequence $$$d$$$.The second line contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the integer on the blackboard.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\\\ldots, d_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\leq d_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$).OutputPrint two integers:the first integer should be equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence of $$$p$$$;the second should be equal to the number of them modulo $$$998244353$$$.You should printonly the second numbermodulo $$$998244353$$$.ExamplesInput3 3 1 -1 2Output3 3Input3 100 5 -3 6Output9 7Input3 1 999999999 0 1000000000Output2000000000 1Input5 34 1337 -146 42 -69 228Output1393 3876NoteThe first test case was explained in the statement.In the second test case $$$p = [100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 104, 103, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108]$$$.In the third test case $$$p = [1, 2, \\\\ldots, 2000000000]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c25f948e", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a starting number and a sequence of numbers.
