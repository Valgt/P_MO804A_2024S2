It can be shown that at least one solution always exists.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence.The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$).All numbers in the sequence are pairwise distinct. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputThe answer for each testcase should contain $$$\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac n 2 \\\\right\\\\rfloor$$$ different pairs of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that $$$x \\\\neq y$$$, $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ appear in $$$a$$$ and $$$x~mod~y$$$ doesn't appear in $$$a$$$. Print the pairs one after another.You can print the pairs in any order. However, the order of numbers in the pair should be exactly such that the first number is $$$x$$$ and the second number is $$$y$$$. All pairs should be pairwise distinct.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.ExampleInput4 2 1 4 4 2 8 3 4 5 3 8 5 9 7 6 2 7 5 3 4 8Output4 1 8 2 8 4 9 5 7 5 8 7 4 3 5 2NoteIn the first testcase there are only two pairs: $$$(1, 4)$$$ and $$$(4, 1)$$$. $$$\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac 2 2 \\\\right\\\\rfloor=1$$$, so we have to find one pair. $$$1~mod~4=1$$$, and $$$1$$$ appears in $$$a$$$, so that pair is invalid. Thus, the only possible answer is a pair $$$(4, 1)$$$.In the second testcase, we chose pairs $$$8~mod~2=0$$$ and $$$8~mod~4=0$$$. $$$0$$$ doesn't appear in $$$a$$$, so that answer is valid. There are multiple possible answers for that testcase.In the third testcase, the chosen pairs are $$$9~mod~5=4$$$ and $$$7~mod~5=2$$$. Neither $$$4$$$, nor $$$2$$$, appears in $$$a$$$, so that answer is valid.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2908d376", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of  $n$ distinct positive integers.
