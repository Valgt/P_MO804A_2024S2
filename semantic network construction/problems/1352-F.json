Binary String Reconstructiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor some binary string $$$s$$$ (i.e. each character $$$s_i$$$ is either '0' or '1'), all pairs of consecutive (adjacent) characters were written. In other words, all substrings of length $$$2$$$ were written. For each pair (substring of length $$$2$$$), the number of '1' (ones) in it was calculated.You are given three numbers:$$$n_0$$$ — the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals $$$0$$$;$$$n_1$$$ — the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals $$$1$$$;$$$n_2$$$ — the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals $$$2$$$.For example, for the string $$$s=$$$\"1110011110\", the following substrings would be written: \"11\", \"11\", \"10\", \"00\", \"01\", \"11\", \"11\", \"11\", \"10\". Thus, $$$n_0=1$$$, $$$n_1=3$$$, $$$n_2=5$$$.Your task is to restoreanysuitable binary string $$$s$$$ from the given values $$$n_0, n_1, n_2$$$. It is guaranteed that at least one of the numbers $$$n_0, n_1, n_2$$$ is greater than $$$0$$$. Also, it is guaranteed that a solution exists.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then test cases follow.Each test case consists of one line which contains three integers $$$n_0, n_1, n_2$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le n_0, n_1, n_2 \\\\le 100$$$; $$$n_0 + n_1 + n_2 > 0$$$). It is guaranteed that the answer for given $$$n_0, n_1, n_2$$$ exists.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines. Each of the lines should contain a binary string corresponding to a test case. If there are several possible solutions, print any of them.ExampleInput7 1 3 5 1 1 1 3 9 3 0 1 0 3 1 2 0 0 3 2 0 0Output1110011110 0011 0110001100101011 10 0000111 1111 000", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "629d1c67", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given three numbers:\n\n* $n_0$: the number of pairs of consecutive characters in a binary string where both characters are '0'.\n* $n_1$: the number of pairs of consecutive characters in a binary string where one character is '0' and the other is '1'.\n* $n_2$: the number of pairs of consecutive characters in a binary string where both characters are '1'.\n\nYour task is to find any possible binary string that satisfies these conditions. \n\nFor example, if $n_0 = 1$, $n_1 = 3$, and $n_2 = 5$, one possible solution is the string \"1110011110\". \n\n\n\nYou will be given multiple test cases, each with its own set of $n_0$, $n_1$, and $n_2$ values."}, {"prompt_md5": "8edfe3cd", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given the counts of pairs of consecutive characters in a binary string (0 or 1) where the pairs have 0, 1, or 2 ones.
