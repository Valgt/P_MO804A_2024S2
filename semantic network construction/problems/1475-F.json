Unusual Matrixtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two binary square matrices $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of size $$$n \\\\times n$$$. A matrix is called binary if each of its elements is equal to $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. You can do the following operations on the matrix $$$a$$$arbitrarynumber of times (0 or more):verticalxor. You choose the number $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le j \\\\le n$$$) and for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$) do the following: $$$a_{i, j} := a_{i, j} \\\\oplus 1$$$ ($$$\\\\oplus$$$ — is the operationxor(exclusive or)).horizontalxor. You choose the number $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$) and for all $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le j \\\\le n$$$) do the following: $$$a_{i, j} := a_{i, j} \\\\oplus 1$$$.Note that the elements of the $$$a$$$ matrix change after each operation.For example, if $$$n=3$$$ and the matrix $$$a$$$ is: $$$$$$ \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} $$$$$$ Then the following sequence of operations shows an example of transformations:verticalxor, $$$j=1$$$. $$$$$$ a= \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} $$$$$$horizontalxor, $$$i=2$$$. $$$$$$ a= \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} $$$$$$verticalxor, $$$j=2$$$. $$$$$$ a= \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} $$$$$$Check if there is a sequence of operations such that the matrix $$$a$$$ becomes equal to the matrix $$$b$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the size of the matrices.The following $$$n$$$ lines contain strings of length $$$n$$$, consisting of the characters '0' and '1' — the description of the matrix $$$a$$$.An empty line follows.The following $$$n$$$ lines contain strings of length $$$n$$$, consisting of the characters '0' and '1' — the description of the matrix $$$b$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.OutputFor each test case, output on a separate line:\"YES\", there is such a sequence of operations that the matrix $$$a$$$ becomes equal to the matrix $$$b$$$;\"NO\" otherwise.You can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill be recognized as positive).ExampleInput3 3 110 001 110  000 000 000 3 101 010 101  010 101 010 2 01 11  10 10OutputYES YES NONoteThe first test case is explained in the statements.In the second test case, the following sequence of operations is suitable:horizontalxor, $$$i=1$$$;horizontalxor, $$$i=2$$$;horizontalxor, $$$i=3$$$;It can be proved that there is no sequence of operations in the third test case so that the matrix $$$a$$$ becomes equal to the matrix $$$b$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "af940f85", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two square matrices,  $a$ and $b$, both of size $n \\times n$.
