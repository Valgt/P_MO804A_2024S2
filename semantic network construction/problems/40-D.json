Interesting Sequencetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutBerland scientists noticed long ago that the world around them depends on Berland population. Due to persistent research in this area the scientists managed to find out that the Berland chronology starts from the moment when the first two people came to that land (it is considered to have happened in the first year). After one Berland year after the start of the chronology the population had already equaled 13 people (the second year). However, tracing the population number during the following years was an ultimately difficult task, still it was found out that ifdi— the number of people in Berland in the year ofi, then eitherdi= 12di- 2, ordi= 13di- 1- 12di- 2. Of course no one knows how many people are living in Berland at the moment, but now we can tell if there could possibly be a year in which the country population equaledA. That's what we ask you to determine. Also, if possible, you have to find out in which years it could be (from the beginning of Berland chronology). Let's suppose that it could be in the years ofa1,a2, ...,ak. Then you have to define how many residents could be in the country during those years apart from theAvariant. Look at the examples for further explanation.InputThe first line contains integerA(1 ≤A< 10300). It is guaranteed that the number doesn't contain leading zeros.OutputOn the first output line printYES, if there could be a year in which the total population of the country equaledA, otherwise printNO.If the answer isYES, then you also have to print numberk— the number of years in which the population could equalA. On the next line you have to output preciselykspace-separated numbers —a1,a2, ...,ak. Those numbers have to be output in the increasing order.On the next line you should output numberp— how many variants of the number of people could be in the years ofa1,a2, ...,ak, apart from theAvariant. On each of the nextplines you have to print one number — the sought number of residents. Those number also have to go in the increasing order.If any number (or both of them)korpexceeds1000, then you have to print1000instead of it and only the first1000possible answers in the increasing order.The numbers should have no leading zeros.ExamplesInput2OutputYES110Input3OutputNOInput13OutputYES120Input1729OutputYES141156", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "307836d0", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a positive integer $A$, determine if there exists a year in which the population of a country could equal $A$. \n\nThe population of the country follows a specific rule:\n\n* If the population in year $i$ is $d_i$, then the population in year $i+1$ can be either $12d_{i-1}$ or $13d_{i-1} - 12d_{i-2}$.\n\nIf such a year exists, output \"YES\" followed by:\n\n1.
