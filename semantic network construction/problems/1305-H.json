Kuroni the Private Tutortime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAs a professional private tutor, Kuroni has to gather statistics of an exam. Kuroni has appointed you to complete this important task. You must not disappoint him.The exam consists of $$$n$$$ questions, and $$$m$$$ students have taken the exam. Each question was worth $$$1$$$ point. Question $$$i$$$ was solved by at least $$$l_i$$$ and at most $$$r_i$$$ students. Additionally, you know that the total score of all students is $$$t$$$.Furthermore, you took a glance at the final ranklist of the quiz. The students were ranked from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$, where rank $$$1$$$ has the highest score and rank $$$m$$$ has the lowest score. Ties were broken arbitrarily.You know that the student at rank $$$p_i$$$ had a score of $$$s_i$$$ for $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le q$$$.You wonder if there could have been a huge tie for first place. Help Kuroni determine the maximum number of students who could have gotten as many points as the student with rank $$$1$$$, and the maximum possible score for rank $$$1$$$ achieving this maximum number of students.InputThe first line of input contains two integers ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 10^{5}$$$), denoting the number of questions of the exam and the number of students respectively.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers each, with the $$$i$$$-th line containing $$$l_{i}$$$ and $$$r_{i}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le l_{i} \\\\le r_{i} \\\\le m$$$).The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le q \\\\le m$$$).The next $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers each, denoting $$$p_{i}$$$ and $$$s_{i}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_{i} \\\\le m$$$, $$$0 \\\\le s_{i} \\\\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that all $$$p_{i}$$$ are distinct and if $$$p_{i} \\\\le p_{j}$$$, then $$$s_{i} \\\\ge s_{j}$$$.The last line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le t \\\\le nm$$$), denoting the total score of all students.OutputOutput two integers: the maximum number of students who could have gotten as many points as the student with rank $$$1$$$, and the maximum possible score for rank $$$1$$$ achieving this maximum number of students. If there is no valid arrangement that fits the given data, output $$$-1$$$ $$$-1$$$.ExamplesInput5 4 2 4 2 3 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 4 1 7Output3 2Input5 6 0 6 0 6 2 5 6 6 4 6 1 3 3 30Output-1 -1NoteFor the first sample, here is one possible arrangement that fits the data:Students $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ both solved problems $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$.Student $$$3$$$ solved problems $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$.Student $$$4$$$ solved problem $$$4$$$.The total score of all students is $$$T = 7$$$. Note that the scores of the students are $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$1$$$ respectively, which satisfies the condition that the student at rank $$$4$$$ gets exactly $$$1$$$ point. Finally, $$$3$$$ students tied for first with a maximum score of $$$2$$$, and it can be proven that we cannot do better with any other arrangement.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "25997849", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given information about a multiple-choice exam. \n\n* There are $n$ questions, each worth 1 point.\n* $m$ students took the exam.\n* For each question $i$, at least $l_i$ and at most $r_i$ students answered it correctly.\n* The total score of all students is $t$.\n* You know the score of $q$ students, specifically the student ranked $p_i$ had a score of $s_i$.\n\nDetermine the maximum number of students who could have tied for first place (highest score) and the maximum possible score for that tie.
