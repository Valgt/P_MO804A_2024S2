In other words, if nodesuandvare inS, then all nodes lying on the simple path betweenuandvshould also be presented inS..Your task is to count the number of valid sets. Since the result can be very large, you must print its remainder modulo1000000007(109+ 7).InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersd(0 ≤d≤ 2000) andn(1 ≤n≤ 2000).The second line containsnspace-separated positive integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 2000).Then the nextn- 1line each contain pair of integersuandv(1 ≤u,v≤n) denoting that there is an edge betweenuandv.
