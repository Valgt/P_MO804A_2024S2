Bracket Subsequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA bracket sequence is a string containing only characters \"(\" and \")\". A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"1\" and \"+\" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences \"()()\" and \"(())\" are regular (the resulting expressions are: \"(1)+(1)\" and \"((1+1)+1)\"), and \")(\", \"(\" and \")\" are not.Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.You are given a regular bracket sequence $$$s$$$ and an integer number $$$k$$$. Your task is to find a regular bracket sequence of length exactly $$$k$$$ such that it is also a subsequence of $$$s$$$.It is guaranteed that such sequence always exists.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, both $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ are even) — the length of $$$s$$$ and the length of the sequence you are asked to find.The second line is a string $$$s$$$ — regular bracket sequence of length $$$n$$$.OutputPrint a single string — a regular bracket sequence of length exactly $$$k$$$ such that it is also a subsequence of $$$s$$$.It is guaranteed that such sequence always exists.ExamplesInput6 4()(())Output()()Input8 8(()(()))Output(()(()))", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f9ab92ed", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string of parentheses,  \"()\",  where each parenthesis is either an opening parenthesis \"(\" or a closing parenthesis \")\".  \n\nYour task is to find the longest possible subsequence of parentheses from the given string that is also a valid bracket sequence.
