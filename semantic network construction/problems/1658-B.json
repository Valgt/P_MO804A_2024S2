Marin and Anti-coprime Permutationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMarin wants you to count number of permutations that arebeautiful. Abeautifulpermutation of length $$$n$$$ is a permutation that has the following property: $$$$$$ \\\\gcd (1 \\\\cdot p_1, \\\\, 2 \\\\cdot p_2, \\\\, \\\\dots, \\\\, n \\\\cdot p_n) > 1, $$$$$$ where $$$\\\\gcd$$$ is thegreatest common divisor.A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3, 4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^3$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — number ofbeautifulpermutations.
