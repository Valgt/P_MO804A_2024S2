Phoenix and Balancetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPhoenix has $$$n$$$ coins with weights $$$2^1, 2^2, \\\\dots, 2^n$$$. He knows that $$$n$$$ is even.He wants to split the coins into two piles such that each pile has exactly $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ coins and the difference of weights between the two piles isminimized. Formally, let $$$a$$$ denote the sum of weights in the first pile, and $$$b$$$ denote the sum of weights in the second pile. Help Phoenix minimize $$$|a-b|$$$, the absolute value of $$$a-b$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 30$$$; $$$n$$$ is even) — the number of coins that Phoenix has.OutputFor each test case, output one integer — the minimum possible difference of weights between the two piles.ExampleInput2 2 4Output2 6NoteIn the first test case, Phoenix has two coins with weights $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$. No matter how he divides the coins, the difference will be $$$4-2=2$$$.In the second test case, Phoenix has four coins of weight $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$8$$$, and $$$16$$$. It is optimal for Phoenix to place coins with weights $$$2$$$ and $$$16$$$ in one pile, and coins with weights $$$4$$$ and $$$8$$$ in another pile. The difference is $$$(2+16)-(4+8)=6$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d56ec156", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an even number  $n$  of coins with weights $2^1$, $2^2$, ..., $2^n$.
