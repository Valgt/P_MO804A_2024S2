Quick Tortoisetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutJohn Doe has a field, which is a rectangular table of sizen×m. We assume that the field rows are numbered from 1 tonfrom top to bottom, and the field columns are numbered from 1 tomfrom left to right. Then the cell of the field at the intersection of thex-th row and they-th column has coordinates (x;y).We know that some cells of John's field are painted white, and some are painted black. Also, John has a tortoise, which can move along the white cells of the field. The tortoise can get from a white cell with coordinates (x;y) into cell (x+ 1;y) or (x;y+ 1), if the corresponding cell is painted white. In other words, the turtle can move only along the white cells of the field to the right or down. The turtle can not go out of the bounds of the field.In addition, John hasqqueries, each of them is characterized by four numbersx1,y1,x2,y2(x1≤x2,y1≤y2). For each query John wants to know whether the tortoise can start from the point with coordinates (x1;y1), and reach the point with coordinates (x2;y2), moving only along the white squares of the field.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 500) — the field sizes.Each of the nextnlines containsmcharacters \"#\" and \".\": thej-th character of thei-th line equals \"#\", if the cell (i;j) is painted black and \".\", if it is painted white.The next line contains integerq(1 ≤q≤ 6·105)— the number of queries. Nextqlines contain four space-separated integersx1,y1,x2andy2(1 ≤x1≤x2≤n,1 ≤y1≤y2≤m) — the coordinates of the starting and the finishing cells. It is guaranteed that cells (x1;y1) and (x2;y2) are white.OutputFor each ofqqueries print on a single line \"Yes\", if there is a way from cell (x1;y1) to cell (x2;y2), that meets the requirements, and \"No\" otherwise. Print the answers to the queries in the order, in which the queries are given in the input.ExamplesInput3 3....##.#.51 1 3 31 1 1 31 1 3 11 1 1 21 1 2 1OutputNoYesYesYesYesInput5 5......###.......###......51 1 5 51 1 1 51 1 3 42 1 2 51 1 2 5OutputYesYesYesNoYes", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5da4e7ba", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a rectangular grid of size $n \\times m$.
