A Vital Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp has a strict daily schedule. He hasnalarms set for each day, and thei-th alarm rings each day at the same time during exactly one minute.Determine the longest time segment when Polycarp can sleep, i. e. no alarm rings in that period. It is possible that Polycarp begins to sleep in one day, and wakes up in another.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of alarms.Each of the nextnlines contains a description of one alarm. Each description has a format \"hh:mm\", wherehhis the hour when the alarm rings, andmmis the minute of that hour when the alarm rings. The number of hours is between0and23, and the number of minutes is between0and59. All alarm times are distinct. The order of the alarms is arbitrary.Each alarm starts ringing in the beginning of the corresponding minute and rings for exactly one minute (i. e. stops ringing in the beginning of the next minute). Polycarp can start sleeping instantly when no alarm is ringing, and he wakes up at the moment when some alarm starts ringing.OutputPrint a line in format \"hh:mm\", denoting the maximum time Polycarp can sleep continuously.hhdenotes the number of hours, andmmdenotes the number of minutes. The number of minutes should be between0and59.
