BerOS file systemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test64 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe new operating system BerOS has a nice feature. It is possible to use any number of characters'/'as a delimiter in path instead of one traditional'/'. For example, strings//usr///local//nginx/sbin//and/usr/local/nginx///sbinare equivalent. The character'/'(or some sequence of such characters) at the end of the path is required only in case of the path to the root directory, which can be represented as single character'/'.A path called normalized if it contains the smallest possible number of characters'/'.Your task is to transform a given path to the normalized form.InputThe first line of the input contains only lowercase Latin letters and character'/'â€” the path to some directory. All paths start with at least one character'/'.
