Lovely Matrixtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLenny had ann×mmatrix of positive integers. He loved the matrix so much, because each row of the matrix was sorted in non-decreasing order. For the same reason he calls such matrices of integerslovely.One day when Lenny was at school his little brother was playing with Lenny's matrix in his room. He erased some of the entries of the matrix and changed the order of some of its columns. When Lenny got back home he was very upset. Now Lenny wants to recover his matrix.Help him to find an order for the columns of the matrix so that it's possible to fill in the erased entries of the matrix to achieve a lovely matrix again. Note, that you can fill the erased entries of the matrix with any integers.InputThe first line of the input contains two positive integersnandm(1 ≤n·m≤ 105). Each of the nextnlines containsmspace-separated integers representing the matrix. An integer -1 shows an erased entry of the matrix. All other integers (each of them is between0and109inclusive) represent filled entries.OutputIf there exists no possible reordering of the columns print -1. Otherwise the output should containmintegersp1,p2, ...,pmshowing the sought permutation of columns. So, the first column of the lovely matrix will bep1-th column of the initial matrix, the second column of the lovely matrix will bep2-th column of the initial matrix and so on.ExamplesInput3 31 -1 -11 2 12 -1 1Output3 1 2Input2 31 2 22 5 4Output1 3 2Input2 31 2 33 2 1Output-1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "627a248f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an $n \\times m$ matrix of integers.
