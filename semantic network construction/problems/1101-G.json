(Zero XOR Subset)-lesstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ of integer numbers.Your task is to divide the array into the maximum number of segments in such a way that:each element is contained inexactly onesegment;each segment contains at least one element;there doesn't exist a non-empty subset of segments such that bitwise XOR of the numbers from them is equal to $$$0$$$.Print the maximum number of segments the array can be divided into. Print-1if no suitable division exists.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint the maximum number of segments the array can be divided into while following the given constraints. Print-1if no suitable division exists.ExamplesInput4 5 5 7 2Output2Input3 1 2 3Output-1Input3 3 1 10Output3NoteIn the first example $$$2$$$ is the maximum number. If you divide the array into $$$\\\\{[5], [5, 7, 2]\\\\}$$$, the XOR value of the subset of only the second segment is $$$5 \\\\oplus 7 \\\\oplus 2 = 0$$$. $$$\\\\{[5, 5], [7, 2]\\\\}$$$ has the value of the subset of only the first segment being $$$5 \\\\oplus 5 = 0$$$. However, $$$\\\\{[5, 5, 7], [2]\\\\}$$$ will lead to subsets $$$\\\\{[5, 5, 7]\\\\}$$$ of XOR $$$7$$$, $$$\\\\{[2]\\\\}$$$ of XOR $$$2$$$ and $$$\\\\{[5, 5, 7], [2]\\\\}$$$ of XOR $$$5 \\\\oplus 5 \\\\oplus 7 \\\\oplus 2 = 5$$$.Let's take a look at some division on $$$3$$$ segments — $$$\\\\{[5], [5, 7], [2]\\\\}$$$. It will produce subsets:$$$\\\\{[5]\\\\}$$$, XOR $$$5$$$;$$$\\\\{[5, 7]\\\\}$$$, XOR $$$2$$$;$$$\\\\{[5], [5, 7]\\\\}$$$, XOR $$$7$$$;$$$\\\\{[2]\\\\}$$$, XOR $$$2$$$;$$$\\\\{[5], [2]\\\\}$$$, XOR $$$7$$$;$$$\\\\{[5, 7], [2]\\\\}$$$, XOR $$$0$$$;$$$\\\\{[5], [5, 7], [2]\\\\}$$$, XOR $$$5$$$;As you can see, subset $$$\\\\{[5, 7], [2]\\\\}$$$ has its XOR equal to $$$0$$$, which is unacceptable. You can check that for other divisions of size $$$3$$$ or $$$4$$$, non-empty subset with $$$0$$$ XOR always exists.The second example has no suitable divisions.The third example array can be divided into $$$\\\\{[3], [1], [10]\\\\}$$$.
