Little Elephant and Rozdiltime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe Little Elephant loves Ukraine very much. Most of all he loves town Rozdol (ukr. \"Rozdil\").However, Rozdil is dangerous to settle, so the Little Elephant wants to go to some other town. The Little Elephant doesn't like to spend much time on travelling, so for his journey he will choose a town that needs minimum time to travel to. If there are multiple such cities, then the Little Elephant won't go anywhere.For each town except for Rozdil you know the time needed to travel to this town. Find the town the Little Elephant will go to or print \"Still Rozdil\", if he stays in Rozdil.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 105)— the number of cities. The next line containsnintegers, separated by single spaces: thei-th integer represents the time needed to go from town Rozdil to thei-th town. The time values are positive integers, not exceeding109.You can consider the cities numbered from1ton, inclusive. Rozdil is not among the numbered cities.OutputPrint the answer on a single line — the number of the town the Little Elephant will go to. If there are multiple cities with minimum travel time, print \"Still Rozdil\" (without the quotes).ExamplesInput27 4Output2Input77 4 47 100 4 9 12OutputStill RozdilNoteIn the first sample there are only two cities where the Little Elephant can go. The travel time for the first town equals7, to the second one —4. The town which is closest to Rodzil (the only one) is the second one, so the answer is2.In the second sample the closest cities are cities two and five, the travelling time to both of them equals4, so the answer is \"Still Rozdil\".", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0ea47337", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of $n$ cities and the travel time from a starting city to each of these cities.
