Set Constructiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a binary matrix $$$b$$$ (all elements of the matrix are $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$) of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns.You need to construct a $$$n$$$ sets $$$A_1, A_2, \\\\ldots, A_n$$$, for which the following conditions are satisfied:Each set is nonempty and consists of distinct integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ inclusive.All sets are distinct.For all pairs $$$(i,j)$$$ satisfying $$$1\\\\leq i, j\\\\leq n$$$, $$$b_{i,j}=1$$$ if and only if $$$A_i\\\\subsetneq A_j$$$. In other words, $$$b_{i, j}$$$ is $$$1$$$ if $$$A_i$$$ is a proper subset of $$$A_j$$$ and $$$0$$$ otherwise.Set $$$X$$$ is a proper subset of set $$$Y$$$, if $$$X$$$ is a nonempty subset of $$$Y$$$, and $$$X \\\\neq Y$$$.It's guaranteed that for all test cases in this problem, such $$$n$$$ sets exist.Note that it doesn't mean that such $$$n$$$ sets exist for all possible inputs.If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 100$$$).The following $$$n$$$ lines contain a binary matrix $$$b$$$, the $$$j$$$-th character of $$$i$$$-th line denotes $$$b_{i,j}$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.It's guaranteed that for all test cases in this problem, such $$$n$$$ sets exist.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ lines.For the $$$i$$$-th line, first output $$$s_i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le s_i \\\\le n)$$$  — the size of the set $$$A_i$$$. Then, output $$$s_i$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$  — the elements of the set $$$A_i$$$.If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.It's guaranteed that for all test cases in this problem, such $$$n$$$ sets exist.ExampleInput2 4 0001 1001 0001 0000 3 011 001 000Output3 1 2 3 2 1 3 2 2 4 4 1 2 3 4 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3NoteIn the first test case, we have $$$A_1 = \\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}, A_2 = \\\\{1, 3\\\\}, A_3 = \\\\{2, 4\\\\}, A_4 = \\\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\\\}$$$.
