Color the Picturetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA picture can be represented as an $$$n\\\\times m$$$ grid ($$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns) so that each of the $$$n \\\\cdot m$$$ cells is colored with one color. You have $$$k$$$ pigments of different colors. You have a limited amount of each pigment, more precisely you can color at most $$$a_i$$$ cells with the $$$i$$$-th pigment.A picture is considered beautiful if each cell hasat least$$$3$$$toroidalneighbors with the same color as itself.Two cells are consideredtoroidalneighbors if theytoroidallyshare an edge. In other words, for some integers $$$1 \\\\leq x_1,x_2 \\\\leq n$$$ and $$$1 \\\\leq y_1,y_2 \\\\leq m$$$, the cell in the $$$x_1$$$-th row and $$$y_1$$$-th column is a toroidal neighbor of the cell in the $$$x_2$$$-th row and $$$y_2$$$-th column if one of following two conditions holds:$$$x_1-x_2 \\\\equiv \\\\pm1 \\\\pmod{n}$$$ and $$$y_1=y_2$$$, or$$$y_1-y_2 \\\\equiv \\\\pm1 \\\\pmod{m}$$$ and $$$x_1=x_2$$$.Notice that each cell has exactly $$$4$$$ toroidal neighbors. For example, if $$$n=3$$$ and $$$m=4$$$, the toroidal neighbors of the cell $$$(1, 2)$$$ (the cell on the first row and second column) are: $$$(3, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 3)$$$, $$$(1, 1)$$$. They are shown in gray on the image below:The gray cells show toroidal neighbors of $$$(1, 2)$$$.Is it possible to color all cells with the pigments provided and create a beautiful picture?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\\\leq n,m \\\\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of rows and columns of the picture and the number of pigments.The next line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\dots, a_k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — $$$a_i$$$ is the maximum number of cells that can be colored with the $$$i$$$-th pigment.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print \"Yes\" (without quotes) if it is possible to color a beautiful picture. Otherwise, print \"No\" (without quotes).ExampleInput64 6 312 9 83 3 28 83 3 29 54 5 210 115 4 29 1110 10 311 45 14OutputYes No Yes Yes No NoNoteIn the first test case, one possible solution is as follows:In the third test case, we can color all cells with pigment $$$1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "772eff92", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a grid of $n \\times m$ cells.
