Hossam and (sub-)palindromic treetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputHossam has an unweighted tree $$$G$$$ with letters in vertices.Hossam defines $$$s(v, \\\\, u)$$$ as a string that is obtained by writing down all the letters on the unique simple path from the vertex $$$v$$$ to the vertex $$$u$$$ in the tree $$$G$$$.A string $$$a$$$ is asubsequenceof a string $$$s$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$s$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero) letters. For example, \"dores\", \"cf\", and \"for\" are subsequences of \"codeforces\", while \"decor\" and \"fork\" are not.Apalindromeis a string that reads the same from left to right and from right to left. For example, \"abacaba\" is a palindrome, but \"abac\" is not.Hossam defines asub-palindromeof a string $$$s$$$ as a subsequence of $$$s$$$, that is a palindrome. For example, \"k\", \"abba\" and \"abhba\" are sub-palindromes of the string \"abhbka\", but \"abka\" and \"cat\" are not.Hossam defines amaximal sub-palindromeof a string $$$s$$$ as a sub-palindrome of $$$s$$$, which has the maximal length among all sub-palindromes of $$$s$$$. For example, \"abhbka\" has only one maximal sub-palindrome — \"abhba\". But it may also be that the string has several maximum sub-palindromes: the string \"abcd\" has $$$4$$$ maximum sub-palindromes.Help Hossam find the length of the longest maximal sub-palindrome among all $$$s(v, \\\\, u)$$$ in the tree $$$G$$$.Note that the sub-palindrome is a subsequence, not a substring.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 200$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case has one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^3$$$) — the number of vertices in the graph.The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th symbol of which denotes the letter on the vertex $$$i$$$. It is guaranteed that all characters in this string are lowercase English letters.The next $$$n - 1$$$ lines describe the edges of the tree. Each edge is given by two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v, \\\\, u \\\\le n$$$, $$$v \\\\neq u$$$). These two numbers mean that there is an edge $$$(v, \\\\, u)$$$ in the tree. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that sum of all $$$n$$$ doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^3$$$.OutputFor each test case output one integer — the length of the longest maximal sub-palindrome among all $$$s(v, \\\\, u)$$$.ExampleInput25abaca1 21 33 44 59caabadedb1 22 32 41 55 65 75 88 9Output3 5NoteIn the first example the maximal subpalindromes are \"aaa\" with letters in vertices $$$1, \\\\, 3, \\\\, 5$$$, or \"aca\" with letters in vertices $$$1, \\\\, 4, \\\\, 5$$$.The tree from the first example.In the second example there is only one maximal palindrome \"bacab\" with letters in vertices $$$4, \\\\, 2, \\\\, 1, \\\\, 5, \\\\, 9$$$.The tree from the second example.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "fd049323", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ vertices, each labeled with a lowercase English letter.  \n\nFor each pair of vertices $v$ and $u$ in the tree, define a string $s(v,u)$ as the sequence of letters along the unique path from vertex $v$ to vertex $u$.\n\nA sub-palindrome of a string is a subsequence that is also a palindrome.
