Sereja and Tabletime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutSereja has ann×mrectangular tablea, each cell of the table contains a zero or a number one. Sereja wants his table to meet the following requirement: each connected component of the same values forms a rectangle with sides parallel to the sides of the table. Rectangles should be filled with cells, that is, if a component form a rectangle of sizeh×w, then the component must contain exactlyhwcells.A connected component of the same values is a set of cells of the table that meet the following conditions:every two cells of the set have the same value;the cells of the set form a connected region on the table (two cells are connected if they are adjacent in some row or some column of the table);it is impossible to add any cell to the set unless we violate the two previous conditions.Can Sereja change the values of at mostkcells of the table so that the table met the described requirement? What minimum number of table cells should he change in this case?InputThe first line contains integersn,mandk(1 ≤n,m≤ 100; 1 ≤k≤ 10).
