Letter Pickingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, they are given a non-empty string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string is even. Each player also has a string of their own, initially empty.Alice starts, then they alternate moves. In one move, a player takes either the first or the last letter of the string $$$s$$$, removes it from $$$s$$$ andprepends(adds to the beginning) it to their own string.The game ends when the string $$$s$$$ becomes empty. The winner is the player with a lexicographically smaller string. If the players' strings are equal, then it's a draw.A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if there exists such position $$$i$$$ that $$$a_j = b_j$$$ for all $$$j < i$$$ and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.What is the result of the game if both players play optimally (e. g. both players try to win; if they can't, then try to draw)?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases.Each testcase consists of a single line — a non-empty string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string $$$s$$$ is even.The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2000$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print the result of the game if both players play optimally.
