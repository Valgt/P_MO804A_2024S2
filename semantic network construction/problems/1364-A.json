XXXXXtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEhab loves number theory, but for some reason he hates the number $$$x$$$. Given an array $$$a$$$, find the length of its longest subarray such that the sum of its elementsisn'tdivisible by $$$x$$$, or determine that such subarray doesn't exist.An array $$$a$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le t \\\\le 5)$$$ — the number of test cases you need to solve. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains 2 integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$ and the number that Ehab hates.The second line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\\\\ldots$$$, $$$a_{n}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print the length of the longest subarray whose sum isn't divisible by $$$x$$$.
