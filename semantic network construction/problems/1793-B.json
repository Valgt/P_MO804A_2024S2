Fedya and Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor his birthday recently Fedya was given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers arranged in a circle, For each pair of neighboring numbers ($$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_2$$$, $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$, $$$\\\\ldots$$$, $$$a_{n - 1}$$$ and $$$a_n$$$, $$$a_n$$$ and $$$a_1$$$) the absolute difference between them is equal to $$$1$$$.Let's call alocal maximuman element, which is greater than both of its neighboring elements. Also call alocal minimuman element, which is less than both of its neighboring elements. Note, that elements $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_n$$$ are neighboring elements.Unfortunately, Fedya lost an array, but he remembered in it the sum of local maximums $$$x$$$ and the sum of local minimums $$$y$$$.Given $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, help Fedya find any matching array ofminimumlength.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.Each line of each test case contain two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$-10^{9} \\\\le y < x \\\\le 10^{9}$$$) — the sum of local maximums and the sum of local minimums, respectively.OutputFor each test case, in the first line print one integer $$$n$$$ — the minimum length of matching arrays.In the second line print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^{9} \\\\leqslant a_i \\\\leqslant 10^{9}$$$) — the array elements such that the the absolute difference between each pair of neighboring is equal to $$$1$$$.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^{5}$$$.ExampleInput43 -24 -42 -15 -3Output10 0 1 2 1 0 -1 0 -1 0 1 16 -2 -1 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1  6 1 0 -1 0 1 0 16 2 3 2 1 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 1 2 1 0 1NoteIn the first test case, the local maximums are the numbers at $$$3, 7$$$ and $$$10$$$ positions, and the local minimums are the numbers at $$$1, 6$$$ and $$$8$$$ positions. $$$x = a_3 + a_7 + a_{10} = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3$$$, $$$y = a_1 + a_6 + a_8 = 0 + (-1) + (-1) = -2$$$.In the second test case, the local maximums are the numbers at $$$2$$$ and $$$10$$$ positions, and the local minimums are the numbers at $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ positions. $$$x = a_2 + a_{10} = -1 + 5 = 4$$$, $$$y = a_1 + a_3 = -2 + (-2) = -4$$$.In the third test case, the local maximums are the numbers at $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$ positions, and the local minimums are the numbers at $$$3$$$ and $$$6$$$ positions.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b9a09dd6", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers, $x$ and $y$.
