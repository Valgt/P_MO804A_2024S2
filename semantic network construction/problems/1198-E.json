Rectangle Painting 2time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a square grid of size $$$n \\\\times n$$$. Some cells are colored in black, all others are colored in white. In one operation you can select some rectangle and color all its cells in white. It costs $$$\\\\min(h, w)$$$ to color a rectangle of size $$$h \\\\times w$$$. You are to make all cells white for minimum total cost.The square is large, so we give it to you in a compressed way. The set of black cells is the union of $$$m$$$ rectangles.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{9}$$$, $$$0 \\\\le m \\\\le 50$$$) — the size of the square grid and the number of black rectangles.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains 4 integers $$$x_{i1}$$$ $$$y_{i1}$$$ $$$x_{i2}$$$ $$$y_{i2}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_{i1} \\\\le x_{i2} \\\\le n$$$, $$$1 \\\\le y_{i1} \\\\le y_{i2} \\\\le n$$$) — the coordinates of the bottom-left and the top-right corner cells of the $$$i$$$-th black rectangle.The rectangles may intersect.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum total cost of painting the whole square in white.ExamplesInput10 2 4 1 5 10 1 4 10 5Output4Input7 6 2 1 2 1 4 2 4 3 2 5 2 5 2 3 5 3 1 2 1 2 3 2 5 3Output3NoteThe examples and some of optimal solutions are shown on the pictures below.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "70e4da27", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a square grid of size $n \\times n$.
