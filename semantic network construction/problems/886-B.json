Vlad and Cafestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVlad likes to eat in cafes very much. During his life, he has visited cafesntimes. Unfortunately, Vlad started to feel that his last visits are not any different from each other. To fix that Vlad had a small research.First of all, Vlad assigned individual indices to all cafes. Then, he wrote down indices of cafes he visited in a row, in order of visiting them. Now, Vlad wants to find such a cafe that his last visit to that cafe was before his last visits to every other cafe. In other words, he wants to find such a cafe that he hasn't been there for as long as possible. Help Vlad to find that cafe.InputIn first line there is one integern(1 ≤n≤ 2·105) — number of cafes indices written by Vlad.In second line,nnumbersa1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤ 2·105) are written — indices of cafes in order of being visited by Vlad. Vlad could visit some cafes more than once. Note that in numeration, some indices could be omitted.OutputPrint one integer — index of the cafe that Vlad hasn't visited for as long as possible.ExamplesInput51 3 2 1 2Output3Input62 1 2 2 4 1Output2NoteIn first test, there are three cafes, and the last visits to cafes with indices1and2were after the last visit to cafe with index3; so this cafe is the answer.In second test case, there are also three cafes, but with indices1,2and4. Cafes with indices1and4were visited after the last visit of cafe with index2, so the answer is2. Note that Vlad could omit some numbers while numerating the cafes.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "49f21d5a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of $n$ integers ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) representing the indices of cafes visited in order.
