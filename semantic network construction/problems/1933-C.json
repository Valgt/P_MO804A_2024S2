Turtle Fingers: Count the Values of ktime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given threepositiveintegers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$l$$$ ($$$a,b,l>0$$$).It can be shown that there always exists a way to choosenon-negative(i.e. $$$\\\\ge 0$$$) integers $$$k$$$, $$$x$$$, and $$$y$$$ such that $$$l = k \\\\cdot a^x \\\\cdot b^y$$$.Your task is to find the number of distinct possible values of $$$k$$$ across all such ways.InputThe first line contains the integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The following $$$t$$$ lines contain three integers, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$l$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le 10^6$$$) — description of a test case.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ lines, with the $$$i$$$-th ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le t$$$) line containing an integer, the answer to the $$$i$$$-th test case.ExampleInput112 5 202 5 214 6 482 3 723 5 752 2 10243 7 83349100 100 10000007 3 22 6 617 3 632043Output6 1 5 12 6 11 24 4 1 3 24NoteIn the first test case, $$$a=2, b=5, l=20$$$. The possible values of $$$k$$$ (and corresponding $$$x,y$$$) are as follows:Choose $$$k = 1, x = 2, y = 1$$$. Then $$$k \\\\cdot a^x \\\\cdot b^y = 1 \\\\cdot 2^2 \\\\cdot 5^1 = 20 = l$$$.Choose $$$k = 2, x = 1, y = 1$$$. Then $$$k \\\\cdot a^x \\\\cdot b^y = 2 \\\\cdot 2^1 \\\\cdot 5^1 = 20 = l$$$.Choose $$$k = 4, x = 0, y = 1$$$. Then $$$k \\\\cdot a^x \\\\cdot b^y = 4 \\\\cdot 2^0 \\\\cdot 5^1 = 20 = l$$$.Choose $$$k = 5, x = 2, y = 0$$$. Then $$$k \\\\cdot a^x \\\\cdot b^y = 5 \\\\cdot 2^2 \\\\cdot 5^0 = 20 = l$$$.Choose $$$k = 10, x = 1, y = 0$$$. Then $$$k \\\\cdot a^x \\\\cdot b^y = 10 \\\\cdot 2^1 \\\\cdot 5^0 = 20 = l$$$.Choose $$$k = 20, x = 0, y = 0$$$. Then $$$k \\\\cdot a^x \\\\cdot b^y = 20 \\\\cdot 2^0 \\\\cdot 5^0 = 20 = l$$$.In the second test case, $$$a=2, b=5, l=21$$$. Note that $$$l = 21$$$ is not divisible by either $$$a = 2$$$ or $$$b = 5$$$. Therefore, we can only set $$$x = 0, y = 0$$$, which corresponds to $$$k = 21$$$.In the third test case, $$$a=4, b=6, l=48$$$. The possible values of $$$k$$$ (and corresponding $$$x,y$$$) are as follows:Choose $$$k = 2, x = 1, y = 1$$$.
