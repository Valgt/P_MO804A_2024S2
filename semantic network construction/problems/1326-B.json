Maximumstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlicia has an array, $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$, of non-negative integers. For each $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$, she has found a non-negative integer $$$x_i = max(0, a_1, \\\\ldots, a_{i-1})$$$. Note that for $$$i=1$$$, $$$x_i = 0$$$.For example, if Alicia had the array $$$a = \\\\{0, 1, 2, 0, 3\\\\}$$$, then $$$x = \\\\{0, 0, 1, 2, 2\\\\}$$$.Then, she calculated an array, $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n$$$: $$$b_i = a_i - x_i$$$.For example, if Alicia had the array $$$a = \\\\{0, 1, 2, 0, 3\\\\}$$$, $$$b = \\\\{0-0, 1-0, 2-1, 0-2, 3-2\\\\} = \\\\{0, 1, 1, -2, 1\\\\}$$$.Alicia gives you the values $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n$$$ and asks you to restore the values $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$.

It can be shown that the solution is unique.ExamplesInput5 0 1 1 -2 1Output0 1 2 0 3Input3 1000 999999000 -1000000000Output1000 1000000000 0Input5 2 1 2 2 3Output2 3 5 7 10NoteThe first test was described in the problem statement.In the second test, if Alicia had an array $$$a = \\\\{1000, 1000000000, 0\\\\}$$$, then $$$x = \\\\{0, 1000, 1000000000\\\\}$$$ and $$$b = \\\\{1000-0, 1000000000-1000, 0-1000000000\\\\} = \\\\{1000, 999999000, -1000000000\\\\}$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "da3ad12d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array $b$ of $n$ integers.
