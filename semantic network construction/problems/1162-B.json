Double Matrixtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are giventwo$$$n \\\\times m$$$ matrices containing integers. A sequence of integers is strictly increasing if each next number is greater than the previous one. A row is strictly increasing if all numbers from left to right are strictly increasing. A column is strictly increasing if all numbers from top to bottom are strictly increasing. A matrix is increasing if all rows are strictly increasingandall columns are strictly increasing.For example, the matrix $$$\\\\begin{bmatrix} 9&10&11\\\\\\\\ 11&12&14\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}$$$ is increasing because each individual row and column is strictly increasing. On the other hand, the matrix $$$\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&1\\\\\\\\ 2&3\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}$$$ is not increasing because the first row is not strictly increasing.Let a position in the $$$i$$$-th row (from top) and $$$j$$$-th column (from left) in a matrix be denoted as $$$(i, j)$$$.In one operation, you can choose any two numbers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ and swap the number located in $$$(i, j)$$$ in the first matrix with the number in $$$(i, j)$$$ in the second matrix. In other words, you can swap two numbers in different matrices if they are located in the corresponding positions.You would like to make both matrices increasing by performing some number of operations (possibly none). Determine if it is possible to do this. If it is, print \"Possible\", otherwise, print \"Impossible\".InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n,m \\\\leq 50$$$) — the dimensions of each matrix.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i1}, a_{i2}, \\\\ldots, a_{im}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_{ij} \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the number located in position $$$(i, j)$$$ in the first matrix.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_{i1}, b_{i2}, \\\\ldots, b_{im}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq b_{ij} \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the number located in position $$$(i, j)$$$ in the second matrix.OutputPrint a string \"Impossible\" or \"Possible\".ExamplesInput2 2 2 10 11 5 9 4 3 12OutputPossibleInput2 3 2 4 5 4 5 6 3 6 7 8 10 11OutputPossibleInput3 2 1 3 2 4 5 10 3 1 3 6 4 8OutputImpossibleNoteThe first example, we can do an operation on the top left and bottom right cells of the matrices. The resulting matrices will be $$$\\\\begin{bmatrix} 9&10\\\\\\\\ 11&12\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}$$$ and $$$\\\\begin{bmatrix} 2&4\\\\\\\\ 3&5\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}$$$.In the second example, we don't need to do any operations.In the third example, no matter what we swap, we can't fix the first row to be strictly increasing in both matrices.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b4cab849", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two $n \\times m$ matrices containing integers.  \n\nA matrix is increasing if all its rows and columns are strictly increasing.  \n\nYou can perform the following operation any number of times:\n\n* Choose two positions $(i,j)$ in the two matrices.\n* Swap the numbers at those positions.\n\nDetermine if it is possible to make both matrices increasing by performing these operations.
