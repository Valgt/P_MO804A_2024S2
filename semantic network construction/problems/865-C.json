Gotta Go Fasttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou're trying to set the record on your favorite video game. The game consists ofNlevels, which must be completed sequentially in order to beat the game. You usually complete each level as fast as possible, but sometimes finish a level slower. Specifically, you will complete thei-th level in eitherFiseconds orSiseconds, whereFi<Si, and there's aPipercent chance of completing it inFiseconds. After completing a level, you may decide to either continue the game and play the next level, or reset the game and start again from the first level. Both the decision and the action are instant.Your goal is to complete all the levels sequentially in at mostRtotal seconds. You want to minimize the expected amount of time playing before achieving that goal. If you continue and reset optimally, how much total time can you expect to spend playing?InputThe first line of input contains integersNandR, the number of levels and number of seconds you want to complete the game in, respectively.Nlines follow. Theith such line contains integersFi,Si,Pi(1 ≤Fi<Si≤ 100, 80 ≤Pi≤ 99), the fast time for leveli, the slow time for leveli, and the probability (as a percentage) of completing leveliwith the fast time.OutputPrint the total expected time. Your answer must be correct within an absolute or relative error of10- 9.Formally, let your answer bea, and the jury's answer beb.

There's an81%chance of completing the level in2seconds and a19%chance of needing8seconds, both of which are within the goal time. The expected time is0.81·2 + 0.19·8 = 3.14.In the second example, you should reset after the first level if you complete it slowly. On average it will take0.25slow attempts before your first fast attempt. Then it doesn't matter whether you complete the second level fast or slow.
