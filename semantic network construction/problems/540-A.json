Each time he wants to put there the treasures that he's earned fair and square, he has to open the lock.The combination lock is represented bynrotating disks with digits from 0 to 9 written on them. Scrooge McDuck has to turn some disks so that the combination of digits on the disks forms a secret combination. In one move, he can rotate one disk one digit forwards or backwards. In particular, in one move he can go from digit 0 to digit 9 and vice versa. What minimum number of actions does he need for that?InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 1000) — the number of disks on the combination lock.The second line contains a string ofndigits — the original state of the disks.The third line contains a string ofndigits — Scrooge McDuck's combination that opens the lock.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum number of moves Scrooge McDuck needs to open the lock.ExamplesInput58219564723Output13NoteIn the sample he needs 13 moves:1 disk:2 disk:3 disk:4 disk:5 disk:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "3a5630c0", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a combination lock with $n$ disks.
