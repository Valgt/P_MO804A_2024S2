Berserk Monsterstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp is playing a computer game (yet again). Guess what is he doing? That's right, killing monsters.There are $$$n$$$ monsters in a row, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th monster has two parameters: attack value equal to $$$a_i$$$ and defense value equal to $$$d_i$$$. In order to kill these monsters, Monocarp put a berserk spell on them, so they're attacking each other instead of Monocarp's character.The fight consists of $$$n$$$ rounds. Every round, the following happens:first, every alive monster $$$i$$$ deals $$$a_i$$$ damage to theclosestalive monster to the left (if it exists) and theclosestalive monster to the right (if it exists);then, every alive monster $$$j$$$ which received more than $$$d_j$$$ damageduring this rounddies. I. e. the $$$j$$$-th monster dies if and only if its defense value $$$d_j$$$ isstrictly lessthan the total damage it receivedthis round.For each round, calculate the number of monsters that will die during that round.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of three lines:the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$);the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$);the third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\\\dots, d_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le d_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer should be equal to the number of monsters that die during the $$$i$$$-th round.ExampleInput353 4 7 5 104 9 1 18 122 11 341 1 2 43 3 4 2Output3 1 0 0 0  0 0  1 1 1 0NoteExplanation for the first test case of the example:During the first round, the following happens:the monster $$$1$$$ deals $$$3$$$ damage to the monster $$$2$$$;the monster $$$2$$$ deals $$$4$$$ damage to the monster $$$1$$$ and the monster $$$3$$$;the monster $$$3$$$ deals $$$7$$$ damage to the monster $$$2$$$ and the monster $$$4$$$;the monster $$$4$$$ deals $$$5$$$ damage to the monster $$$3$$$ and the monster $$$5$$$;the monster $$$5$$$ deals $$$10$$$ damage to the monster $$$4$$$;the monster $$$1$$$ does not die, since it received $$$4$$$ damage and its defense is $$$4$$$;the monster $$$2$$$ dies, since it received $$$10$$$ damage and its defense is $$$9$$$;the monster $$$3$$$ dies, since it received $$$9$$$ damage and its defense is $$$1$$$;the monster $$$4$$$ does not die, since it received $$$17$$$ damage and its defense is $$$18$$$;the monster $$$5$$$ dies, since it received $$$5$$$ damage and its defense is $$$1$$$.After the first round, the monsters $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ stay alive.During the second round, the following happens:the monster $$$1$$$ deals $$$3$$$ damage to the monster $$$4$$$;the monster $$$4$$$ deals $$$5$$$ damage to the monster $$$1$$$;the monster $$$1$$$ dies, since it received $$$5$$$ damage and its defense is $$$4$$$;the monster $$$4$$$ does not die, since it received $$$3$$$ damage and its defense is $$$18$$$.During the next three rounds, only the $$$4$$$-th monster is alive, so nothing happens.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b5a9f883", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers representing the attack values of $n$ monsters, and another array of $n$ integers representing their defense values.  \n\nIn each round, each monster attacks the two closest monsters to its left and right (if they exist).
