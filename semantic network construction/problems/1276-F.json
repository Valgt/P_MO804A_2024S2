Asterisk Substringstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputConsider a string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ lowercase English letters. Let $$$t_i$$$ be the string obtained by replacing the $$$i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ with an asterisk character*. For example, when $$$s = \\\\mathtt{abc}$$$, we have $$$t_1 = \\\\tt{*bc}$$$, $$$t_2 = \\\\tt{a*c}$$$, and $$$t_3 = \\\\tt{ab*}$$$.Given a string $$$s$$$, count the number of distinct strings of lowercase English letters and asterisks that occur as a substring of at least one string in the set $$$\\\\{s, t_1, \\\\ldots, t_n \\\\}$$$. The empty string should be counted.Note that*'s are just characters and do not play any special role as in, for example, regex matching.InputThe only line contains a string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ lowercase English letters ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$).OutputPrint a single integer — the number of distinct strings of $$$s, t_1, \\\\ldots, t_n$$$.ExampleInputabcOutput15NoteFor the sample case, the distinct substrings are (empty string),a,b,c,*,ab,a*,bc,b*,*b,*c,abc,ab*,a*c,*bc.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "260bbda2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string of lowercase English letters.  \n\nFor each letter in the string, create a new string by replacing that letter with an asterisk (*).  \n\nCount the total number of unique strings (including the empty string) that appear as a substring in any of the original string and its variations."}, {"prompt_md5": "056d087f", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a string.
