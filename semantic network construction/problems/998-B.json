Cuttingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are a lot of things which could be cut — trees, paper, \"the rope\". In this problem you are going to cut a sequence of integers.There is a sequence of integers, which contains the equal number of even and odd numbers. Given a limited budget, you need to make maximum possible number of cuts such that each resulting segment will have the same number of odd and even integers.Cuts separate a sequence to continuous (contiguous) segments. You may think about each cut as a break between two adjacent elements in a sequence. So after cutting each element belongs to exactly one segment. Say, $$$[4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5]$$$ $$$\\\\to$$$ two cuts $$$\\\\to$$$ $$$[4, 1 | 2, 3, 4, 5 | 4, 4, 5, 5]$$$. On each segment the number of even elements should be equal to the number of odd elements.The cost of the cut between $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ numbers is $$$|x - y|$$$ bitcoins. Find the maximum possible number of cuts that can be made while spending no more than $$$B$$$ bitcoins.InputFirst line of the input contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) and an integer $$$B$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le B \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of elements in the sequence and the number of bitcoins you have.Second line contains $$$n$$$ integers: $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 100$$$) — elements of the sequence, which contains the equal number of even and odd numbersOutputPrint the maximum possible number of cuts which can be made while spending no more than $$$B$$$ bitcoins.ExamplesInput6 41 2 5 10 15 20Output1Input4 101 3 2 4Output0Input6 1001 2 3 4 5 6Output2NoteIn the first sample the optimal answer is to split sequence between $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$. Price of this cut is equal to $$$3$$$ bitcoins.In the second sample it is not possible to make even one cut even with unlimited number of bitcoins.In the third sample the sequence should be cut between $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, and between $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$. The total price of the cuts is $$$1 + 1 = 2$$$ bitcoins.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "43055de2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ integers with an equal number of even and odd numbers.
