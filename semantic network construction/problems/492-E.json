Vanya and Fieldtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutVanya decided to walk in the field of sizen×ncells. The field containsmapple trees, thei-th apple tree is at the cell with coordinates(xi,yi). Vanya moves towards vector(dx,dy). That means that if Vanya is now at the cell(x,y), then in a second he will be at cell. The following condition is satisfied for the vector:, whereis the largest integer that divides bothaandb. Vanya ends his path when he reaches the square he has already visited.Vanya wonders, from what square of the field he should start his path to see as many apple trees as possible.InputThe first line contains integersn,m,dx,dy(1 ≤n≤ 106,1 ≤m≤ 105,1 ≤dx,dy≤n) — the size of the field, the number of apple trees and the vector of Vanya's movement. Nextmlines contain integersxi,yi(0 ≤xi,yi≤n- 1) — the coordinates of apples. One cell may contain multiple apple trees.OutputPrint two space-separated numbers — the coordinates of the cell from which you should start your path.If there are several answers you are allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput5 5 2 30 01 21 32 43 1Output1 3Input2 3 1 10 00 11 1Output0 0NoteIn the first sample Vanya's path will look like:(1, 3) - (3, 1) - (0, 4) - (2, 2) - (4, 0) - (1, 3)In the second sample:(0, 0) - (1, 1) - (0, 0)", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "26e988ec", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a field of size $n \\times n$ cells.

The movement rule is: if you are currently at cell $(x, y)$, you will move to cell $(x + dx, y + dy)$ in the next step.  The vector $(dx, dy)$ is chosen such that $dx$ and $dy$ have the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1.\n\nYour goal is to find the starting cell $(x, y)$ from which you can visit the maximum number of apple trees while following the movement rule.
