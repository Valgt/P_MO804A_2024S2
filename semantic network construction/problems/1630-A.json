Formally, if $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ are the elements of the $$$i$$$-th pair, then the following must hold: $$$$$$\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n/2}{a_i \\\\& b_i} = k,$$$$$$ where $$$\\\\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation.If there are many solutions, print any of them, if there is no solution, print $$$-1$$$ instead.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 400$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.Each test case consists of a single line with two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$4 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2^{16}$$$, $$$n$$$ is a power of $$$2$$$, $$$0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n-1$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2^{16}$$$. All test cases in each individual input will be pairwisedifferent.OutputFor each test case, if there is no solution, print a single line with the integer $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, print $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of them must contain $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$, the elements in the $$$i$$$-th pair.If there are many solutions, print any of them.
