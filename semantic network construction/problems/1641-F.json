Covering Circletime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSam started playing with round buckets in the sandbox, while also scattering pebbles. His mom decided to buy him a new bucket, so she needs to solve the following task.You are given $$$n$$$ distinct points with integer coordinates $$$A_1, A_2, \\\\ldots, A_n$$$. All points were generated from the square $$$[-10^8, 10^8] \\\\times [-10^8, 10^8]$$$ uniformly and independently.You are given positive integers $$$k$$$, $$$l$$$, such that $$$k \\\\leq l \\\\leq n$$$. You want to select a subsegment $$$A_i, A_{i+1}, \\\\ldots, A_{i+l-1}$$$ of the points array (for some $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n + 1 - l$$$), and some circle on the plane, containing $$$\\\\geq k$$$ points of the selected subsegment (inside or on the border).What is the smallest possible radius of that circle?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq k \\\\leq l \\\\leq n \\\\leq 50\\\\,000$$$, $$$k \\\\leq 20$$$).Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^8 \\\\leq x_i, y_i \\\\leq 10^8$$$) — the coordinates of the point $$$A_i$$$. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct and were generated independently from uniform distribution on $$$[-10^8, 10^8] \\\\times [-10^8, 10^8]$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$50\\\\,000$$$.In the first test, points were not generated from the uniform distribution on $$$[-10^8, 10^8] \\\\times [-10^8, 10^8]$$$ for simplicity. It isthe onlysuch test and your solutionmustpass it.Hacks are disabled in this problem.OutputFor each test case print a single real number — the answer to the problem.Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-9}$$$. Formally let your answer be $$$a$$$, jury answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer will be considered correct if $$$\\\\frac{|a - b|}{\\\\max{(1, |b|)}} \\\\le 10^{-9}$$$.ExampleInput43 2 20 00 43 05 4 31 10 02 20 22 08 3 20 31 00 21 10 11 20 01 35 4 41 1-3 32 25 35 5Output2.00000000000000000000 1.00000000000000000000 0.50000000000000000000 4.00000000000000000000NoteIn the first test case, we can select subsegment $$$A_1, A_2$$$ and a circle with center $$$(0, 2)$$$ and radius $$$2$$$.In the second test case, we can select subsegment $$$A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$$$ and a circle with center $$$(1, 2)$$$ and radius $$$1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "06257bce", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ points in a 2D plane, each with integer coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$.
