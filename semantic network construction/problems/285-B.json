Find Marbletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutPetya and Vasya are playing a game. Petya's gotnnon-transparent glasses, standing in a row. The glasses' positions are indexed with integers from1tonfrom left to right. Note that the positions are indexed but the glasses are not.First Petya puts a marble under the glass in positions. Then he performs some (possibly zero) shuffling operations. One shuffling operation means moving the glass from the first position to positionp1, the glass from the second position to positionp2and so on. That is, a glass goes from positionito positionpi. Consider all glasses are moving simultaneously during one shuffling operation. When the glasses are shuffled, the marble doesn't travel from one glass to another: it moves together with the glass it was initially been put in.After all shuffling operations Petya shows Vasya that the ball has moved to positiont. Vasya's task is to say what minimum number of shuffling operations Petya has performed or determine that Petya has made a mistake and the marble could not have got from positionsto positiont.InputThe first line contains three integers:n,s,t(1 ≤n≤ 105; 1 ≤s,t≤n)— the number of glasses, the ball's initial and final position. The second line containsnspace-separated integers:p1,p2, ...,pn(1 ≤pi≤n)— the shuffling operation parameters. It is guaranteed that allpi's are distinct.Note thatscan equalt.OutputIf the marble can move from positionsto positiont, then print on a single line a non-negative integer — the minimum number of shuffling operations, needed to get the marble to positiont. If it is impossible, print number -1.ExamplesInput4 2 12 3 4 1Output3Input4 3 34 1 3 2Output0Input4 3 41 2 3 4Output-1Input3 1 32 1 3Output-1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "87c06e9e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ glasses arranged in a row, numbered from 1 to $n$.
