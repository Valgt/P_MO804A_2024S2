Even-Odd Incrementstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given $$$n$$$ of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$. Process $$$q$$$ queries of two types:query of the form \"0 $$$x_j$$$\": add the value $$$x_j$$$ to all even elements of the array $$$a$$$,query of the form \"1 $$$x_j$$$\": add the value $$$x_j$$$ to all odd elements of the array $$$a$$$.Note that when processing the query, we look specifically at the odd/even value of $$$a_i$$$, not its index.After processing each query, print the sum of the elements of the array $$$a$$$.Please note that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (likelong longfor C++).InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n$$$, $$$q \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries.The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers: $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.The following $$$q$$$ lines contain queries as two integers $$$type_j$$$ and $$$x_j$$$ $$$(0 \\\\leq type_j \\\\leq 1$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq x_j \\\\leq 10^4$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ over all test cases in a test does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. Similarly, the sum of values $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$q$$$ numbers: the sum of the elements of the array $$$a$$$ after processing a query.ExampleInput41 111 13 31 2 40 21 30 56 71 3 2 4 10 481 60 50 40 51 30 120 16 71000000000 1000000000 1000000000 11 15 170 171 100001 510 920 531 160 1Output2 11 14 29 80 100 100 100 118 190 196 3000000094 3000060094 3000060400 3000060952 3000061270 3000061366 3000061366NoteIn the first test case, the array $$$a = [2]$$$ after the first query.In the third test case, the array $$$a$$$ is modified as follows: $$$[1, 3, 2, 4, 10, 48]$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$[7, 9, 2, 4, 10, 48]$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$[7, 9, 7, 9, 15, 53]$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$[7, 9, 7, 9, 15, 53]$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$[10, 12, 10, 12, 18, 56]$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$[22, 24, 22, 24, 30, 68]$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$[23, 25, 23, 25, 31, 69]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "87077039", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a$ of length $n$.
