Sequence and Swapstime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a sequence $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$, and an integer $$$x$$$. Your task is to make the sequence $$$a$$$ sorted (it is considered sorted if the condition $$$a_1 \\\\le a_2 \\\\le a_3 \\\\le \\\\dots \\\\le a_n$$$ holds).To make the sequence sorted, you may perform the following operation any number of times you want (possibly zero): choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$ and $$$a_i > x$$$, and swap the values of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$x$$$.For example, if $$$a = [0, 2, 3, 5, 4]$$$, $$$x = 1$$$, the following sequence of operations is possible:choose $$$i = 2$$$ (it is possible since $$$a_2 > x$$$), then $$$a = [0, 1, 3, 5, 4]$$$, $$$x = 2$$$;choose $$$i = 3$$$ (it is possible since $$$a_3 > x$$$), then $$$a = [0, 1, 2, 5, 4]$$$, $$$x = 3$$$;choose $$$i = 4$$$ (it is possible since $$$a_4 > x$$$), then $$$a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]$$$, $$$x = 5$$$.Calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform so that $$$a$$$ becomes sorted, or report that it is impossible.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 500$$$, $$$0 \\\\le x \\\\le 500$$$) — the number of elements in the sequence and the initial value of $$$x$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 500$$$).The sum of values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $$$500$$$.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you have to perform to make $$$a$$$ sorted, or $$$-1$$$, if it is impossible.ExampleInput6 4 1 2 3 5 4 5 6 1 1 3 4 4 1 10 2 2 10 11 9 2 10 12 11 5 18 81 324 218 413 324Output3 0 0 -1 1 3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "acdd07d2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and an integer $x$.
