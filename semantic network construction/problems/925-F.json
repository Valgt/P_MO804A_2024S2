Parametric Circulationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVova has recently learned what acirculatonin a graph is. Recall the definition: let $$$G = (V, E)$$$ be a directed graph. A circulation $$$f$$$ is such a collection of non-negative real numbers $$$f_e$$$ ($$$e \\\\in E$$$), that for each vertex $$$v \\\\in V$$$ the followingconservationcondition holds:$$$$$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{e \\\\in \\\\delta^{-}(v)} f_e = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{e \\\\in \\\\delta^{+}(v)} f_e$$$$$$where $$$\\\\delta^{+}(v)$$$ is the set of edges that end in the vertex $$$v$$$, and $$$\\\\delta^{-}(v)$$$ is the set of edges that start in the vertex $$$v$$$. In other words, for each vertex the total incoming flow should be equal to the total outcoming flow.Let a $$$lr$$$-circulation be such a circulation $$$f$$$ that for each edge the condition $$$l_e \\\\leq f_e \\\\leq r_e$$$ holds, where $$$l_e$$$ and $$$r_e$$$ for each edge $$$e \\\\in E$$$ are two non-negative real numbers denoting the lower and upper bounds on the value of the circulation on this edge $$$e$$$.Vova can't stop thinking about applications of a new topic. Right now he thinks about the followingnaturalquestion: let the graph be fixed, and each value $$$l_e$$$ and $$$r_e$$$ be a linear function of a real variable $$$t$$$:$$$$$$l_e(t) = a_e t + b_e$$$$$$ $$$$$$r_e(t) = c_e t + d_e$$$$$$Note that $$$t$$$ is thesamefor all edges.Let $$$t$$$ be chosen at random from uniform distribution on a segment $$$[0, 1]$$$. What is the probability of existence of $$$lr$$$-circulation in the graph?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1000$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 2000$$$).Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines describes edges of the graph in the format $$$u_e$$$, $$$v_e$$$, $$$a_e$$$, $$$b_e$$$, $$$c_e$$$, $$$d_e$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq u_e, v_e \\\\leq n$$$, $$$-10^4 \\\\leq a_e, c_e \\\\leq 10^4$$$, $$$0 \\\\leq b_e, d_e \\\\leq 10^4$$$), where $$$u_e$$$ and $$$v_e$$$ are the startpoint and the endpoint of the edge $$$e$$$, and the remaining 4 integers describe the linear functions for the upper and lower bound of circulation.It is guaranteed that for any $$$t \\\\in [0, 1]$$$ and for any edge $$$e \\\\in E$$$ the following condition holds $$$0 \\\\leq l_e(t) \\\\leq r_e(t) \\\\leq 10^4$$$.OutputPrint a single real integer â€” the probability of existence of $$$lr$$$-circulation in the graph, given that $$$t$$$ is chosen uniformly at random from the segment $$$[0, 1]$$$. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute difference from jury's answer is not greater than $$$10^{-6}$$$.ExampleInput3 31 2 0 3 -4 72 3 -2 5 1 63 1 0 4 0 4Output0.25NoteIn the first example the conservation condition allows only circulations with equal values $$$f_e$$$ for all three edges. The value of circulation on the last edge should be $$$4$$$ whatever $$$t$$$ is chosen, so the probability is$$$$$$P(4 \\\\in [3, -4t + 7]~~\\\\&~~4 \\\\in [-2t + 5, t + 6]) = 0.25$$$$$$", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2b6e9f46", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a directed graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.
