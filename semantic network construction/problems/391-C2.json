He decided to begin with an ongoing tournament. Before Manao joined, there werencontestants in the tournament, numbered from1ton. Each of them had already obtained some amount of tournament points, namely thei-th fighter hadpipoints.Manao is going to engage in a single fight against each contestant. Each of Manao's fights ends in either a win or a loss. A win grants Manao one point, and a loss grants Manao's opponent one point. For eachi, Manao estimated the amount of efforteihe needs to invest to win against thei-th contestant. Losing a fight costs no effort.After Manao finishes all of his fights, the ranklist will be determined, with1being the best rank andn+ 1being the worst. The contestants will be ranked in descending order of their tournament points. The contestants with the same number of points as Manao will be ranked better than him if they won the match against him and worse otherwise. The exact mechanism of breaking ties for other fighters is not relevant here.Manao's objective is to have rankkor better. Determine the minimum total amount of effort he needs to invest in order to fulfill this goal, if it is possible.InputThe first line contains a pair of integersnandk(1 ≤k≤n+ 1). Thei-th of the followingnlines contains two integers separated by a single space —piandei(0 ≤pi,ei≤ 200000).The problem consists of three subproblems. The subproblems have different constraints on the input. You will get some score for the correct submission of the subproblem. The description of the subproblems follows.In subproblem C1 (4 points), the constraint1 ≤n≤ 15will hold.In subproblem C2 (4 points), the constraint1 ≤n≤ 100will hold.In subproblem C3 (8 points), the constraint1 ≤n≤ 200000will hold.OutputPrint a single number in a single line — the minimum amount of effort Manao needs to use to rank in the topk. If no amount of effort can earn Manao such a rank, output number -1.ExamplesInput3 21 11 42 2Output3Input2 13 24 0Output-1Input5 22 102 101 13 13 1Output12NoteConsider the first test case. At the time when Manao joins the tournament, there are three fighters. The first of them has 1 tournament point and the victory against him requires 1 unit of effort. The second contestant also has 1 tournament point, but Manao needs 4 units of effort to defeat him. The third contestant has 2 points and victory against him costs Manao 2 units of effort. Manao's goal is top be in top 2. The optimal decision is to win against fighters1and3, after which Manao, fighter2, and fighter3will all have 2 points. Manao will rank better than fighter3and worse than fighter2, thus finishing in second place.Consider the second test case. Even if Manao wins against both opponents, he will still rank third.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d1b4dffa", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ contestants in a tournament, each with a certain number of points ($p_i$).
