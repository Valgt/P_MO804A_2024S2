The treacherous Republic madekprecision strikes of poweraion the Empire possessions. To cope with the republican threat, the Supreme Council decided to deal a decisive blow to the enemy forces.To successfully complete the conflict, the confrontation balance after the blow should be a positive integer. The balance of confrontation is a number that looks like, wherep=n!(nis the power of the Imperial strike),. After many years of war the Empire's resources are low.
