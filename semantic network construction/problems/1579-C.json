Tickstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputCasimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$. Initially, all cells of the field are white.Let us denote the cell with coordinates $$$i$$$ vertically and $$$j$$$ horizontally by $$$(i, j)$$$. The upper left cell will be referred to as $$$(1, 1)$$$ and the lower right cell as $$$(n, m)$$$.Casimir drawsticksof different sizes on the field. A tick of size $$$d$$$ ($$$d > 0$$$) with its center in cell $$$(i, j)$$$ is drawn as follows:First, the center cell $$$(i, j)$$$ is painted black.Then exactly $$$d$$$ cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly $$$d$$$ cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black.That is all the cells with coordinates $$$(i - h, j \\\\pm h)$$$ for all $$$h$$$ between $$$0$$$ and $$$d$$$ are painted. In particular, a tick consists of $$$2d + 1$$$ black cells.An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the $$$4 \\\\times 9$$$ box, with two ticks of sizes $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$.You are given a description of a checkered field of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly $$$0$$$) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least $$$k$$$ (that is, $$$d \\\\ge k$$$ for all the ticks).Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes $$$d \\\\ge k$$$ or not.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number test cases.The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of the test case description contains the integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 10$$$; $$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 19$$$) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following $$$n$$$ lines describe the field: each line consists of $$$m$$$ characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should beYESif the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size andNOotherwise.You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the stringsyEs,yes,Yes, andYESwill all be recognized as positive answers).ExampleInput8 2 3 1 *.* ... 4 9 2 *.*.*...* .*.*...*. ..*.*.*.. .....*... 4 4 1 *.*. **** .**. .... 5 5 1 ..... *...* .*.*. ..*.* ...*. 5 5 2 ..... *...* .*.*. ..*.* ...*. 4 7 1 *.....* .....*. ..*.*.. ...*... 3 3 1 *** *** *** 3 5 1 *...* .***. .**..OutputNO YES YES YES NO NO NO NONoteThe first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size $$$0$$$ don't exist.The second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, as shown in the figure.The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size $$$1$$$. Their center cells are marked with $$$\\\\color{blue}{\\\\text{blue}}$$$, $$$\\\\color{red}{\\\\text{red}}$$$ and $$$\\\\color{green}{\\\\text{green}}$$$ colors:*.*.*$$$\\\\color{blue}{\\\\textbf{*}}$$$**.$$$\\\\color{green}{\\\\textbf{*}}\\\\color{red}{\\\\textbf{*}}$$$.....The field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$.
