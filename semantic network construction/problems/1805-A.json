You can choose an integer $$$x$$$ and denote $$$b_i=a_i \\\\oplus x$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$, where $$$\\\\oplus$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operation. Is it possible to choose such a number $$$x$$$ that the value of the expression $$$b_1 \\\\oplus b_2 \\\\oplus \\\\ldots \\\\oplus b_n$$$ equals $$$0$$$?It can be shown that if a valid number $$$x$$$ exists, then there also exists $$$x$$$ such that ($$$0 \\\\le x < 2^8$$$).InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^3$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers — array $$$a$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i < 2^8$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^3$$$.OutputFor each set test case, print the integer $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le x < 2^8$$$) if it exists, or $$$-1$$$ otherwise.ExampleInput531 2 531 2 340 1 2 341 2 2 311Output6 0 3 -1 1NoteIn the first test case, after applying the operation with the number $$$6$$$ the array $$$b$$$ becomes $$$[7, 4, 3]$$$, $$$7 \\\\oplus 4 \\\\oplus 3 = 0$$$.There are other answers in the third test case, such as the number $$$0$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4727d9f4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of non-negative integers.
