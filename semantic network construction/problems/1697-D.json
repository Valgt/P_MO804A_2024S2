Guess The Stringtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problem. Remember to flush your output while communicating with the testing program.You may usefflush(stdout)in C++,system.out.flush()in Java,stdout.flush()in Python orflush(output)in Pascal to flush the output. If you use some other programming language, consult its documentation. You may also refer to the guide on interactive problems:https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307.The jury has chosen a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ characters; each character of $$$s$$$ is a lowercase Latin letter. Your task is to guess this string; initially, you know only its length.You may ask queries of two types:$$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ — the query of the first type, where $$$i$$$ is an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. In response to this query, the jury will tell you the character $$$s_i$$$;$$$2$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ — the query of the second type, where $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ are integers such that $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$. In response to this query, the jury will tell you the number of different characters among $$$s_l, s_{l+1}, \\\\dots, s_r$$$.You are allowed to ask no more than $$$26$$$ queries of the first type, and no more than $$$6000$$$ queries of the second type. Your task is to restore the string $$$s$$$.For each test in this problem, the string $$$s$$$ is fixed beforehand, and will be the same for every submission.InputInitially, the jury program sends one integer $$$n$$$ on a separate line — the size of $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$).OutputTo give the answer, print one line! swith a line break in the end, where $$$s$$$ should be the string picked by the jury. After that, your program should flush the output and terminate gracefully.InteractionTo ask a query, you should send one line containing the query, in one of the following formats:? 1 i— for a query of the first type ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$);? 2 l r— for a query of the second type ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$).Don't forget to flush the output after sending the query line.The answer to your query will be given on a separate line. For a query of the first type, the answer will be the character $$$s_i$$$. For a query of the second type, the answer will be an integer equal to the number of different characters among $$$s_l, s_{l+1}, \\\\dots, s_r$$$.You are allowed to ask no more than $$$26$$$ queries of the first type, and no more than $$$6000$$$ queries of the second type.In case you ask too many queries, or the jury program fails to recognize your query format, the answer to your query will be one integer $$$0$$$. After receiving $$$0$$$ as the answer, your program should terminate immediately — otherwise you may receive verdict \"Runtime error\", \"Time limit exceeded\" or some other verdict instead of \"Wrong answer\".ExampleInput5 4 u 2 g e s 1Output? 2 1 5 ? 1 2 ? 2 1 2 ? 1 1 ? 1 3 ? 1 4 ? 2 4 5 ! guessNoteLet's analyze the example of interaction.The string chosen by the jury isguess, so initially the jury sends one integer $$$5$$$.the first query is? 2 1 5, which means \"count the number of different characters among $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\dots, s_5$$$\". The answer to it is $$$4$$$.the second query is? 1 2, which means \"tell which character is $$$s_2$$$\". The answer to it isu.the third query is? 2 1 2, which means \"count the number of different characters among $$$s_1$$$ and $$$s_2$$$\". The answer to it is $$$2$$$.the fourth query is? 1 1, which means \"tell which character is $$$s_1$$$\". The answer to it isg.the fifth query is? 1 3, which means \"tell which character is $$$s_3$$$\". The answer to it ise.the sixth query is? 1 4, which means \"tell which character is $$$s_4$$$\". The answer to it iss.the seventh query is? 2 4 5, which means \"count the number of different characters among $$$s_4$$$ and $$$s_5$$$\". The answer to it is $$$1$$$, so it's possible to deduce that $$$s_4$$$ is the same as $$$s_5$$$.In the end, the answer is submitted as! guess, and it is deduced correctly.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e0a8b476", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string of length $n$ consisting of lowercase letters.
