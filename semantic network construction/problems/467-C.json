George and Jobtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe new ITone 6 has been released recently and George got really keen to buy it. Unfortunately, he didn't have enough money, so George was going to work as a programmer. Now he faced the following problem at the work.Given a sequence ofnintegersp1,p2, ...,pn. You are to choosekpairs of integers:[l1,r1], [l2,r2], ..., [lk,rk] (1 ≤l1≤r1<l2≤r2< ... <lk≤rk≤n;ri-li+ 1 =m),in such a way that the value of sumis maximal possible.
