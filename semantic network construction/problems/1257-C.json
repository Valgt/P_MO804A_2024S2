Dominated Subarraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call an array $$$t$$$dominatedby value $$$v$$$ in the next situation.At first, array $$$t$$$ should have at least $$$2$$$ elements. Now, let's calculate number of occurrences of each number $$$num$$$ in $$$t$$$ and define it as $$$occ(num)$$$. Then $$$t$$$ is dominated (by $$$v$$$) if (and only if) $$$occ(v) > occ(v')$$$ for any other number $$$v'$$$. For example, arrays $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2]$$$, $$$[11, 11]$$$ and $$$[3, 2, 3, 2, 3]$$$ are dominated (by $$$2$$$, $$$11$$$ and $$$3$$$ respectevitely) but arrays $$$[3]$$$, $$$[1, 2]$$$ and $$$[3, 3, 2, 2, 1]$$$ are not.Small remark: since any array can be dominated only by one number, we can not specify this number and just say that array is either dominated or not.You are given array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$. Calculate its shortest dominated subarray or say that there are no such subarrays.The subarray of $$$a$$$ is a contiguous part of the array $$$a$$$, i. e. the array $$$a_i, a_{i + 1}, \\\\dots, a_j$$$ for some $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le j \\\\le n$$$.InputThe first line contains single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.The first line contains single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$) — the corresponding values of the array $$$a$$$.It's guaranteed that the total length of all arrays in one test doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$T$$$ integers — one per test case. For each test case print the only integer — the length of the shortest dominated subarray, or $$$-1$$$ if there are no such subarrays.ExampleInput4 1 1 6 1 2 3 4 5 1 9 4 1 2 4 5 4 3 2 1 4 3 3 3 3Output-1 6 3 2NoteIn the first test case, there are no subarrays of length at least $$$2$$$, so the answer is $$$-1$$$.In the second test case, the whole array is dominated (by $$$1$$$) and it's the only dominated subarray.In the third test case, the subarray $$$a_4, a_5, a_6$$$ is the shortest dominated subarray.In the fourth test case, all subarrays of length more than one are dominated.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "95baa775", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
