Maximize The Valuetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a one-based array consisting of $$$N$$$ integers: $$$A_1, A_2, \\\\cdots, A_N$$$. Initially, the value of each element is set to $$$0$$$.There are $$$M$$$ operations (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$M$$$). Operation $$$i$$$ is represented by $$$\\\\langle L_i, R_i, X_i \\\\rangle$$$. If operation $$$i$$$ is executed, all elements $$$A_j$$$ for $$$L_i \\\\leq j \\\\leq R_i$$$ will be increased by $$$X_i$$$.You have to answer $$$Q$$$independentqueries. Each query is represented by $$$\\\\langle K, S, T \\\\rangle$$$ which represents the following task. Choose a range $$$[l, r]$$$ satisfying $$$S \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq T$$$, and execute operations $$$l, l + 1, \\\\dots, r$$$. The answer to the query is the maximum value of $$$A_K$$$ after the operations are executed among all possible choices of $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$.InputThe first line consists of two integers $$$N$$$ $$$M$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq N, M \\\\leq 100\\\\,000$$$).Each of the next $$$M$$$ lines consists of three integers $$$L_i$$$ $$$R_i$$$ $$$X_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq L_i \\\\leq R_i \\\\leq N; -100\\\\,000 \\\\leq X_i \\\\leq 100\\\\,000$$$).The following line consists of an integer $$$Q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq Q \\\\leq 100\\\\,000$$$).Each of the next $$$Q$$$ lines consists of three integers $$$K$$$ $$$S$$$ $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq K \\\\leq N; 1 \\\\leq S \\\\leq T \\\\leq M$$$).OutputFor each query, output in a single line, an integer which represent the answer of the query.ExamplesInput2 6 1 1 -50 1 2 -20 2 2 -30 1 1 60 1 2 40 2 2 10 5 1 1 6 2 1 6 1 1 3 2 1 3 1 1 2Output100 50 0 0 -20Input5 3 1 3 3 2 4 -2 3 5 3 6 1 1 3 2 1 3 3 1 3 3 2 3 2 2 3 2 2 2Output3 3 4 3 0 -2NoteExplanation for the sample input/output #1For query $$$1$$$, one of the solutions is to execute operation $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$.For query $$$2$$$, one of the solutions is to execute operation $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, and $$$6$$$.For query $$$3$$$, the only solution is to execute operation $$$3$$$.For query $$$4$$$, the only solution is to execute operation $$$1$$$.For query $$$6$$$, the only solution is to execute operation $$$2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "16748127", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $N$ integers.
