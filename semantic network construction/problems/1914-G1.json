Light Bulbs (Easy Version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe easy and hard versions of this problem differ only in the constraints on $$$n$$$. In the easy version, the sum of values of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$. Furthermore, $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$1000$$$ in each test case.There are $$$2n$$$ light bulbs arranged in a row. Each light bulb has a color from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (exactly two light bulbs for each color).Initially, all light bulbs are turned off. You choose a set of light bulbs $$$S$$$ that you initially turn on. After that, you can perform the following operations in any order any number of times:choose two light bulbs $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$of the same color, exactly one of which is on, and turn on the second one;choose three light bulbs $$$i, j, k$$$, such that both light bulbs $$$i$$$ and $$$k$$$are on and have the same color, and the light bulb $$$j$$$ is between them ($$$i < j < k$$$), and turn on the light bulb $$$j$$$.You want to choose a set of light bulbs $$$S$$$ that you initially turn on in such a way that by performing the described operations, you can ensure that all light bulbs are turned on.Calculate two numbers:the minimum size of the set $$$S$$$ that you initially turn on;the number of sets $$$S$$$ of minimum size (taken modulo $$$998244353$$$).InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of pairs of light bulbs.The second line of each test case contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_{2n}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le n$$$), where $$$c_i$$$ is the color of the $$$i$$$-th light bulb. For each color from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, exactly two light bulbs have this color.Additional constraint on the input: the sum of values of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output two integers:the minimum size of the set $$$S$$$ that you initially turn on;the number of sets $$$S$$$ of minimum size (taken modulo $$$998244353$$$).ExampleInput422 2 1 121 2 2 121 2 1 253 4 4 5 3 1 1 5 2 2Output2 4 1 2 1 4 2 8", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e2bdb58e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have a row of $2n$ light bulbs, where each bulb has a color from 1 to $n$.
