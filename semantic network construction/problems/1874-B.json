Jellyfish and Mathtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputJellyfish is given the non-negative integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ and $$$m$$$. Initially $$$(x,y)=(a,b)$$$. Jellyfish wants to do several operations so that $$$(x,y)=(c,d)$$$.For each operation, she can do one of the following:$$$x := x\\\\,\\\\&\\\\,y$$$,$$$x := x\\\\,|\\\\,y$$$,$$$y := x \\\\oplus y$$$,$$$y := y \\\\oplus m$$$.Here $$$\\\\&$$$ denotes thebitwise AND operation, $$$|$$$ denotes thebitwise OR operationand $$$\\\\oplus$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operation.Now Jellyfish asks you for the minimum number of operations such that $$$(x,y)=(c,d)$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains five integers, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a, b, c, d, m < 2^{30}$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations. If this cannot be achieved, output $$$-1$$$ instead.ExampleInput101 0 1 1 13 3 1 2 11 6 0 7 12 4 4 9 821 4 0 17 2850 50 0 0 3995 33 1 33 110138 202 174 64 10878 340 68 340 461457 291 491 566 766Output1 -1 2 -1 -1 2 1 4 1 3NoteIn the first test case, we can do the operation $$$y = x \\\\oplus y$$$.In the second test case, it is not possible to change $$$(x,y)=(1,2)$$$ using any sequence of operations.In the third test case, we can do the operation $$$x = x\\\\,\\\\&\\\\,y$$$ followed by the operation $$$y = y \\\\oplus m$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a3076cff", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given four non-negative integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ and $m$.
