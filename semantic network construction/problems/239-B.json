Easy Tape Programmingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThere is a programming language in which every program is a non-empty sequence of \"<\" and \">\" signs and digits. Let's explain how the interpreter of this programming language works. A program is interpreted using movement of instruction pointer (IP) which consists of two parts.Current character pointer (CP);Direction pointer (DP) which can point left or right;Initially CP points to the leftmost character of the sequence and DP points to the right.We repeat the following steps until the first moment that CP points to somewhere outside the sequence.If CP is pointing to a digit the interpreter prints that digit then CP moves one step according to the direction of DP. After that the value of the printed digit in the sequence decreases by one. If the printed digit was0then it cannot be decreased therefore it's erased from the sequence and the length of the sequence decreases by one.If CP is pointing to \"<\" or \">\" then the direction of DP changes to \"left\" or \"right\" correspondingly. Then CP moves one step according to DP. If the new character that CP is pointing to is \"<\" or \">\" then the previous character will be erased from the sequence.If at any moment the CP goes outside of the sequence the execution is terminated.It's obvious the every program in this language terminates after some steps.We have a sequences1,s2, ...,snof \"<\", \">\" and digits. You should answerqqueries. Each query gives youlandrand asks how many of each digit will be printed if we run the sequencesl,sl+ 1, ...,sras an independent program in this language.InputThe first line of input contains two integersnandq(1 ≤n,q≤ 100)— represents the length of the sequencesand the number of queries.The second line containss, a sequence of \"<\", \">\" and digits (0..9) written from left to right. Note, that the characters ofsare not separated with spaces.The nextqlines each contains two integersliandri(1 ≤li≤ri≤n)— thei-th query.OutputFor each query print10space separated integers:x0,x1, ...,x9wherexiequals the number of times the interpreter printsiwhile running the corresponding program.
