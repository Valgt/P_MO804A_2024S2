Today is a special day for them as their parents left them home alone and commissioned them to donchores. Each chore is characterized by a single parameter — its complexity. The complexity of thei-th chore equalshi.As Petya is older, he wants to take the chores with complexity larger than some valuex(hi>x) to leave to Vasya the chores with complexity less than or equal tox(hi≤x). The brothers have already decided that Petya will do exactlyachores and Vasya will do exactlybchores (a+b=n).In how many ways can they choose an integerxso that Petya got exactlyachores and Vasya got exactlybchores?InputThe first input line contains three integersn,aandb(2 ≤n≤ 2000;a,b≥ 1;a+b=n) — the total number of chores, the number of Petya's chores and the number of Vasya's chores.The next line contains a sequence of integersh1,h2, ...,hn(1 ≤hi≤ 109),hiis the complexity of thei-th chore. The numbers in the given sequence are not necessarily different.All numbers on the lines are separated by single spaces.OutputPrint the required number of ways to choose an integer value ofx.
