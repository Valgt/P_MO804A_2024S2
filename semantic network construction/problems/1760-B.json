Atilla's Favorite Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn order to write a string, Atilla needs to first learn all letters that are contained in the string.Atilla needs to write a message which can be represented as a string $$$s$$$. He asks you what is the minimum alphabet size required so that one can write this message.The alphabet of size $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 26$$$) containsonly the first$$$x$$$ Latin letters. For example an alphabet of size $$$4$$$ containsonlythe characters $$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{b}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{c}$$$ and $$$\\\\texttt{d}$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$$$) — the length of the string.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum alphabet size required to so that Atilla can write his message $$$s$$$.ExampleInput51a4down10codeforces3bcf5zzzzzOutput1 23 19 6 26NoteFor the first test case, Atilla needs to know only the character $$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$, so the alphabet of size $$$1$$$ which only contains $$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$ is enough.For the second test case, Atilla needs to know the characters $$$\\\\texttt{d}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{o}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{w}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{n}$$$.
