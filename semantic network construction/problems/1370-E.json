Binary Subsequence Rotationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNaman has two binary strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ (a binary string is a string which only consists of the characters \"0\" and \"1\"). He wants to convert $$$s$$$ into $$$t$$$ using the following operation as few times as possible.In one operation, he can choose any subsequence of $$$s$$$ and rotate it clockwise once.For example, if $$$s = 1\\\\textbf{1}101\\\\textbf{00}$$$, he can choose a subsequence corresponding to indices ($$$1$$$-based) $$$\\\\{2, 6, 7 \\\\}$$$ and rotate them clockwise. The resulting string would then be $$$s = 1\\\\textbf{0}101\\\\textbf{10}$$$.A string $$$a$$$ is said to be a subsequence of string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deleting some characters without changing the ordering of the remaining characters.To perform a clockwise rotation on a sequence $$$c$$$ of size $$$k$$$ is to perform an operation which sets $$$c_1:=c_k, c_2:=c_1, c_3:=c_2, \\\\ldots, c_k:=c_{k-1}$$$ simultaneously.Determine the minimum number of operations Naman has to perform to convert $$$s$$$ into $$$t$$$ or say that it is impossible.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^6)$$$ — the length of the strings.The second line contains the binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.The third line contains the binary string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$.OutputIf it is impossible to convert $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ after any number of operations, print $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, print the minimum number of operations required.ExamplesInput6 010000 000001Output1Input10 1111100000 0000011111Output5Input8 10101010 01010101Output1Input10 1111100000 1111100001Output-1NoteIn the first test, Naman can choose the subsequence corresponding to indices $$$\\\\{2, 6\\\\}$$$ and rotate it once to convert $$$s$$$ into $$$t$$$.In the second test, he can rotate the subsequence corresponding to all indices $$$5$$$ times. It can be proved, that it is the minimum required number of operations.In the last test, it is impossible to convert $$$s$$$ into $$$t$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4c031fa1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two binary strings,  $s$ and $t$, both of length $n$.
