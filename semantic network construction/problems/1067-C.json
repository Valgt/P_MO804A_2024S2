If there is free cell which is under attack of at least $$$4$$$ knights then he places new knight in this cell. Ivan repeats this until there are no such free cells. One can prove that this process is finite. One can also prove that position in the end does not depend on the order in which new knights are placed.Ivan asked you to find initial placement of exactly $$$n$$$ knights such that in the end there will be at least $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n^{2}}{10} \\\\rfloor$$$ knights.InputThe only line of input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{3}$$$) — number of knights in the initial placement.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ lines. Each line should contain $$$2$$$ numbers $$$x_{i}$$$ and $$$y_{i}$$$ ($$$-10^{9} \\\\le x_{i}, \\\\,\\\\, y_{i} \\\\le 10^{9}$$$) — coordinates of $$$i$$$-th knight. For all $$$i \\\\ne j$$$, $$$(x_{i}, \\\\,\\\\, y_{i}) \\\\ne (x_{j}, \\\\,\\\\, y_{j})$$$ should hold. In other words, all knights should be in different cells.It is guaranteed that the solution exists.ExamplesInput4Output1 13 11 54 4Input7Output2 11 24 15 22 65 76 6NoteLet's look at second example:Green zeroes are initial knights.

Cell $$$(4, \\\\,\\\\, 5)$$$ is initially attacked by only $$$3$$$ knights in cells $$$(2, \\\\,\\\\, 6)$$$, $$$(5, \\\\,\\\\, 7)$$$ and $$$(6, \\\\,\\\\, 6)$$$. But new knight in cell $$$(3, \\\\,\\\\, 3)$$$ also attacks cell $$$(4, \\\\,\\\\, 5)$$$, now it is attacked by $$$4$$$ knights and Ivan will place another knight in this cell. There are no more free cells which are attacked by $$$4$$$ or more knights, so the process stops. There are $$$9$$$ knights in the end, which is not less than $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{7^{2}}{10} \\\\rfloor = 4$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "415e082e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a number  $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^3$).  \n\nYou need to find a way to place $n$ knights on an infinite chessboard such that:\n\n* Each knight starts in a unique cell.\n*  The knights are placed in a way that, after a specific process, there will be at least $\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{10} \\rfloor$ knights on the board.\n\n**The Process:**\n\n1.
