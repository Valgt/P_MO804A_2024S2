Ania and Minimizingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAnia has a large integer $$$S$$$. Its decimal representation has length $$$n$$$ and doesn't contain any leading zeroes. Ania is allowed to change at most $$$k$$$ digits of $$$S$$$. She wants to do it in such a way that $$$S$$$ still won't contain any leading zeroes and it'll be minimal possible. What integer will Ania finish with?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 200\\\\,000$$$, $$$0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n$$$) â€” the number of digits in the decimal representation of $$$S$$$ and the maximum allowed number of changed digits.The second line contains the integer $$$S$$$. It's guaranteed that $$$S$$$ has exactly $$$n$$$ digits and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.OutputOutput the minimal possible value of $$$S$$$ which Ania can end with.
