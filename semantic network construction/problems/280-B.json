The second maximum element in the sequence of distinct numbersx1,x2, ...,xk(k> 1)is such maximum elementxj, that the following inequality holds:.The lucky number of the sequence of distinct positive integersx1,x2, ...,xk(k> 1)is the number that is equal to the bitwise excluding OR of the maximum element of the sequence and the second maximum element of the sequence.You've got a sequence of distinct positive integerss1,s2, ...,sn(n> 1). Let's denote sequencesl,sl+ 1, ...,srass[l..r](1 ≤l<r≤n). Your task is to find the maximum number among all lucky numbers of sequencess[l..r].Note that as all numbers in sequencesare distinct, all the given definitions make sence.InputThe first line contains integern(1 <n≤ 105).
