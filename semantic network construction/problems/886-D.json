Restoration of stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA substring of some string is called the most frequent, if the number of its occurrences is not less than number of occurrences of any other substring.You are given a set of strings. A string (not necessarily from this set) is called good if all elements of the set are the most frequent substrings of this string. Restore the non-empty good string with minimum length. If several such strings exist, restore lexicographically minimum string. If there are no good strings, print \"NO\" (without quotes).A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of letters in the string. For example, \"ab\", \"c\", \"abc\" are substrings of string \"abc\", while \"ac\" is not a substring of that string.The number of occurrences of a substring in a string is the number of starting positions in the string where the substring occurs. These occurrences could overlap.Stringais lexicographically smaller than stringb, ifais a prefix ofb, orahas a smaller letter at the first position whereaandbdiffer.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105) — the number of strings in the set.Each of the nextnlines contains a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters.
