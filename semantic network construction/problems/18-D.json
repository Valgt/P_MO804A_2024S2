Seller Bobtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test128 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLast year Bob earned by selling memory sticks. During each ofndays of his work one of the two following events took place:A customer came to Bob and asked to sell him a2xMB memory stick. If Bob had such a stick, he sold it and got2xberllars.Bob won some programming competition and got a2xMB memory stick as a prize. Bob could choose whether to present this memory stick to one of his friends, or keep it.Bob never kept more than one memory stick, as he feared to mix up their capacities, and deceive a customer unintentionally. It is also known that for each memory stick capacity there was at most one customer, who wanted to buy that memory stick. Now, knowing all the customers' demands and all the prizes won at programming competitions during the lastndays, Bob wants to know, how much money he could have earned, if he had acted optimally.InputThe first input line contains numbern(1 ≤n≤ 5000) — amount of Bob's working days. The followingnlines contain the description of the days. Linesell xstands for a day when a customer came to Bob to buy a2xMB memory stick (0 ≤x≤ 2000). It's guaranteed that for eachxthere is not more than one linesell x. Linewin xstands for a day when Bob won a2xMB memory stick (0 ≤x≤ 2000).OutputOutput the maximum possible earnings for Bob in berllars, that he would have had if he had known all the events beforehand. Don't forget, please, that Bob can't keep more than one memory stick at a time.ExamplesInput7win 10win 5win 3sell 5sell 3win 10sell 10Output1056Input3win 5sell 6sell 4Output0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b07fd0c8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ days.
