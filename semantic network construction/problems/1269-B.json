Both of these sequence have a length $$$n$$$.Permutation is a sequence of $$$n$$$ different positive integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. For example, these sequences are permutations: $$$[1]$$$, $$$[1,2]$$$, $$$[2,1]$$$, $$$[6,7,3,4,1,2,5]$$$. These are not: $$$[0]$$$, $$$[1,1]$$$, $$$[2,3]$$$.You need to find the non-negative integer $$$x$$$, and increase all elements of $$$a_i$$$ by $$$x$$$, modulo $$$m$$$ (i.e. you want to change $$$a_i$$$ to $$$(a_i + x) \\\\bmod m$$$), so it would be possible to rearrange elements of $$$a$$$ to make it equal $$$b$$$, among them you need to find the smallest possible $$$x$$$.In other words, you need to find the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$, for which it is possible to find some permutation $$$p=[p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n]$$$, such that for all $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$, $$$(a_i + x) \\\\bmod m = b_{p_i}$$$, where $$$y \\\\bmod m$$$ — remainder of division of $$$y$$$ by $$$m$$$.For example, if $$$m=3$$$, $$$a = [0, 0, 2, 1], b = [2, 0, 1, 1]$$$, you can choose $$$x=1$$$, and $$$a$$$ will be equal to $$$[1, 1, 0, 2]$$$ and you can rearrange it to make it equal $$$[2, 0, 1, 1]$$$, which is equal to $$$b$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n,m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2000, 1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 10^9$$$): number of elemens in arrays and $$$m$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i < m$$$).The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq b_i < m$$$).It is guaranteed that there exists some non-negative integer $$$x$$$, such that it would be possible to find some permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ such that $$$(a_i + x) \\\\bmod m = b_{p_i}$$$.OutputPrint one integer, the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$, such that it would be possible to find some permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ such that $$$(a_i + x) \\\\bmod m = b_{p_i}$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$.ExamplesInput4 3 0 0 2 1 2 0 1 1Output1Input3 2 0 0 0 1 1 1Output1Input5 10 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0Output0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "04032f70", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given two lists of numbers.
