Appending Mextime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputInitially Ildar has an empty array. He performs $$$n$$$ steps. On each step he takes a subset of integers already added to the array and appends themexof this subset to the array.Themexof an multiset of integers is the smallestnon-negativeinteger not presented in the multiset. For example, themexof the multiset $$$[0, 2, 3]$$$ is $$$1$$$, while themexof the multiset $$$[1, 2, 1]$$$ is $$$0$$$.More formally, on the step $$$m$$$, when Ildar already has an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{m-1}$$$, he chooses some subset of indices $$$1 \\\\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\\\ldots < i_k < m$$$ (possibly, empty), where $$$0 \\\\leq k < m$$$, and appends the $$$mex(a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\\\ldots a_{i_k})$$$ to the end of the array.After performing all the steps Ildar thinks that he might have made a mistake somewhere. He asks you to determine for a given array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ the minimum step $$$t$$$ such that he has definitely made a mistake on at least one of the steps $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, t$$$, or determine that he could have obtained this array without mistakes.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100\\\\,000$$$) — the number of steps Ildar made.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the array Ildar obtained.OutputIf Ildar could have chosen the subsets on each step in such a way that the resulting array is $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$, print $$$-1$$$.Otherwise print a single integer $$$t$$$ — the smallest index of a step such that a mistake was made on at least one step among steps $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, t$$$.ExamplesInput40 1 2 1Output-1Input31 0 1Output1Input40 1 2 239Output4NoteIn the first example it is possible that Ildar made no mistakes. Here is the process he could have followed.$$$1$$$-st step. The initial array is empty. He can choose an empty subset and obtain $$$0$$$, because themexof an empty set is $$$0$$$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $$$[0]$$$.$$$2$$$-nd step. The current array is $$$[0]$$$. He can choose a subset $$$[0]$$$ and obtain an integer $$$1$$$, because $$$mex(0) = 1$$$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $$$[0,1]$$$.$$$3$$$-rd step. The current array is $$$[0,1]$$$. He can choose a subset $$$[0,1]$$$ and obtain an integer $$$2$$$, because $$$mex(0,1) = 2$$$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $$$[0,1,2]$$$.$$$4$$$-th step. The current array is $$$[0,1,2]$$$. He can choose a subset $$$[0]$$$ and obtain an integer $$$1$$$, because $$$mex(0) = 1$$$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $$$[0,1,2,1]$$$.Thus, he can get the array without mistakes, so the answer is $$$-1$$$.In the second example he has definitely made a mistake on the very first step, because he could not have obtained anything different from $$$0$$$.In the third example he could have obtained $$$[0, 1, 2]$$$ without mistakes, but $$$239$$$ is definitely wrong.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ff000436", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
