Jzzhu and Squarestime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutJzzhu has two integers,nandm. He calls an integer point(x,y)of a plane special if0 ≤x≤nand0 ≤y≤m. Jzzhu defines a unit square as a square with corners at points(x,y),(x+ 1,y),(x+ 1,y+ 1),(x,y+ 1), wherexandyare some integers.Let's look at all the squares (their sides not necessarily parallel to the coordinate axes) with corners at the special points. For each such square Jzzhu paints a dot in every unit square that is fully inside it. After that some unit squares can contain several dots. Now Jzzhu wonders, how many dots he has painted on the plane.
