Build a Tree and That Is Ittime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. Note that in this problem, we are talking about not rooted trees.You are given four positive integers $$$n, d_{12}, d_{23}$$$ and $$$d_{31}$$$. Construct a tree such that:it contains $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$,the distance (length of the shortest path) from vertex $$$1$$$ to vertex $$$2$$$ is $$$d_{12}$$$,distance from vertex $$$2$$$ to vertex $$$3$$$ is $$$d_{23}$$$,the distance from vertex $$$3$$$ to vertex $$$1$$$ is $$$d_{31}$$$.Output any tree that satisfies all the requirements above, or determine that no such tree exists.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) —the number of test cases in the test.This is followed by $$$t$$$ test cases, each written on a separate line.Each test case consists of four positive integers $$$n, d_{12}, d_{23}$$$ and $$$d_{31}$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5; 1 \\\\le d_{12}, d_{23}, d_{31} \\\\le n-1$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ values for all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, printYESif the suitable tree exists, andNOotherwise.If the answer is positive, print another $$$n-1$$$ line each containing a description of an edge of the tree — a pair of positive integers $$$x_i, y_i$$$, which means that the $$$i$$$th edge connects vertices $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$.The edges and vertices of the edges can be printed in any order. If there are several suitable trees, output any of them.ExampleInput95 1 2 15 2 2 25 2 2 35 2 2 45 3 2 34 2 1 14 3 1 14 1 2 37 1 4 1OutputYES 1 2 4 1 3 1 2 5 YES 4 3 2 5 1 5 5 3 NO YES 2 4 4 1 2 5 5 3 YES 5 4 4 1 2 5 3 5 YES 2 3 3 4 1 3 NO YES 4 3 1 2 2 4 NO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "957bb4f2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given four numbers: $n$, $d_{12}$, $d_{23}$, and $d_{31}$.  \n\n* $n$ is the number of vertices in a tree.\n* $d_{12}$ is the distance between vertices 1 and 2.\n* $d_{23}$ is the distance between vertices 2 and 3.\n* $d_{31}$ is the distance between vertices 3 and 1.\n\nYour task is to:\n\n1. **Determine if a tree exists** that meets these conditions.\n2. **If a tree exists, construct it** and output the edges that make up the tree.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n* $3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$\n* $1 \\le d_{12}, d_{23}, d_{31} \\le n-1$\n* The sum of all $n$ values across all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like help with any specific part of the problem or have any further questions!"}, {"prompt_md5": "4cd6b581", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number of points and distances between specific pairs of points, determine if you can connect the points to form a tree (a connected graph with no cycles) that satisfies the given distances.
