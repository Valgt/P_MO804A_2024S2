Your task is to restore the initial tetragon.InputThe first input line contains one numberT— amount of tests (1 ≤T≤ 5·104). Each of the followingTlines contains numbersx1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3— coordinates of different points that are the centers of three equal sides (non-negative integer numbers, not exceeding 10).OutputFor each test output two lines. If the required tetragon exists, output in the first lineYES, in the second line — four pairs of numbers — coordinates of the polygon's vertices in clockwise or counter-clockwise order.
