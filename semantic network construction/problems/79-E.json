Security Systemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutFox Ciel safely returned to her castle, but there was something wrong with the security system of the castle: sensors attached in the castle were covering her.Ciel is at point(1, 1)of the castle now, and wants to move to point(n,n), which is the position of her room. By one step, Ciel can move from point(x,y)to either(x+ 1,y)(rightward) or(x,y+ 1)(upward).In her castle,c2sensors are set at points(a+i,b+j)(for every integeriandjsuch that:0 ≤i<c, 0 ≤j<c).Each sensor has a count value and decreases its count value every time Ciel moves. Initially, the count value of each sensor ist. Every time Ciel moves to point(x,y), the count value of a sensor at point(u,v)decreases by (|u-x| + |v-y|). When the count value of some sensor becomesstrictly less than0, the sensor will catch Ciel as a suspicious individual!Determine whether Ciel can move from(1, 1)to(n,n)without being caught by a sensor, and if it is possible, output her steps. Assume that Ciel can move to every point even if there is a censor on the point.InputIn the first line there are five integersn,t,a,b,c(2 ≤n≤ 2·105,0 ≤t≤ 1014,1 ≤a≤n-c+ 1,1 ≤b≤n-c+ 1,1 ≤c≤n).Please do not use the%lldspecificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use thecinstream (also you may use the%I64dspecificator).OutputIf Ciel's objective is possible, output in first line2n- 2characters that represent her feasible steps, wherei-th character isRifi-th step is moving rightward, orUif moving upward.
