Equalize the Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp was gifted an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Polycarp considers an array beautiful if there exists a number $$$C$$$, such that each number in the array occurs either zero or $$$C$$$ times. Polycarp wants to remove some elements from the array $$$a$$$ to make it beautiful.For example, if $$$n=6$$$ and $$$a = [1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2]$$$, then the following options are possible to make the array $$$a$$$ array beautiful:Polycarp removes elements at positions $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$, array $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$[1, 2, 1, 2]$$$;Polycarp removes elements at positions $$$1$$$ and $$$6$$$, array $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$[3, 2, 1, 4]$$$;Polycarp removes elements at positions $$$1, 2$$$ and $$$6$$$, array $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$[2, 1, 4]$$$;Help Polycarp determine the minimum number of elements to remove from the array $$$a$$$ to make it beautiful.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case consists of one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of elements that Polycarp has to remove from the array $$$a$$$ to make it beautiful.ExampleInput3 6 1 3 2 1 4 2 4 100 100 4 100 8 1 2 3 3 3 2 6 6Output2 1 2", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7dc3862e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
