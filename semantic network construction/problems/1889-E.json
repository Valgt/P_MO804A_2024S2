Doremy's Swapping Treestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputConsider two undirected graphs $$$G_1$$$ and $$$G_2$$$. Every node in $$$G_1$$$ and in $$$G_2$$$ has a label. Doremy calls $$$G_1$$$ and $$$G_2$$$ similar if and only if:The labels in $$$G_1$$$ are distinct, and the labels in $$$G_2$$$ are distinct.The set $$$S$$$ of labels in $$$G_1$$$ coincides with the set of labels in $$$G_2$$$.For every pair of two distinct labels $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in $$$S$$$, the corresponding nodes are in the same connected component in $$$G_1$$$ if and only if they are in the same connected component in $$$G_2$$$.Now Doremy gives you two trees $$$T_1$$$ and $$$T_2$$$ with $$$n$$$ nodes, labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. You can do the following operation any number of times:Choose an edge set $$$E_1$$$ from $$$T_1$$$ and an edge set $$$E_2$$$ from $$$T_2$$$, such that $$$\\\\overline{E_1}$$$ and $$$\\\\overline{E_2}$$$ are similar. Here $$$\\\\overline{E}$$$ represents the graph which is given by only reserving the edge set $$$E$$$ from $$$T$$$ (i.e., the edge-induced subgraph). In other words, $$$\\\\overline{E}$$$ is obtained from $$$T$$$ by removing all edges not included in $$$E$$$ and further removing all isolated vertices.Swap the edge set $$$E_1$$$ in $$$T_1$$$ with the edge set $$$E_2$$$ in $$$T_2$$$.Now Doremy is wondering how many distinct $$$T_1$$$ you can get after any number of operations. Can you help her find the answer? Output the answer modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\\\le n\\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes in the trees $$$T_1$$$ and $$$T_2$$$.Each of the following $$$n-1$$$ lines contain two integers $$$u,v$$$ ($$$1\\\\le u,v\\\\le n$$$), representing an undirected edge in $$$T_1$$$. It is guaranteed these edges form a tree.Each of the following $$$n-1$$$ lines contain two integers $$$u,v$$$ ($$$1\\\\le u,v\\\\le n$$$), representing an undirected edge in $$$T_2$$$. It is guaranteed these edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, you should output a single line with an integer, representing the number of distinct $$$T_1$$$ after any number of operations, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.ExampleInput321 22 131 32 32 32 141 22 33 44 22 11 3Output1 2 4NoteIn the first test case, there is at most one distinct $$$T_1$$$ having the only edge $$$(1,2)$$$.In the second test case, you can choose the edge set $$$\\\\{(1,3),(2,3)\\\\}$$$ in $$$T_1$$$, the edge set $$$\\\\{(1,2),(2,3)\\\\}$$$ in $$$T_2$$$ and swap them. So $$$T_1$$$ can be $$$1-3-2$$$ or $$$1-2-3$$$.In the third test case, there are $$$4$$$ distinct $$$T_1$$$, as the following pictures.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4cae00e7", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two trees, $T_1$ and $T_2$, each with $n$ nodes.
