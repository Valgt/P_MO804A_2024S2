Gambling Nimtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAs you know, the game of \"Nim\" is played withnpiles of stones, where thei-th pile initially containsaistones. Two players alternate the turns. During a turn a player picks any non-empty pile and removes any positive number of stones from it. The one who is not able to make a move loses the game.Petya and Vasya are tired of playing Nim, so they invented their own version of the game and named it the \"Gambling Nim\". They haventwo-sided cards, one side of thei-th card has numberaiwritten on it, while the other side has numberbi. At the beginning of the game the players put all the cards on the table, each card only one of its sides up, and this side is chosen independently and uniformly. Thus they obtain a sequencec1,c2, ...,cn, whereciis equal toaiorbi. Then they takenpiles of stones, withi-th pile containing exactlycistones and play Nim. Petya takes the first turn.Given that both players play optimally, find the probability of Petya's victory. Output the answer as an irreducible fraction.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 500 000) — the number of cards in the deck.Each of the followingnlines contains the description of one card, consisting of two integersaiandbi(0 ≤ai,bi≤ 1018).OutputOutput the answer as an irreducible fractionp/q.
