Mishka and triptime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLittle Mishka is a great traveller and she visited many countries. After thinking about where to travel this time, she chose XXX — beautiful, but little-known northern country.Here are some interesting facts about XXX:XXX consists ofncities,kof whose (just imagine!) are capital cities.All of cities in the country are beautiful, but each is beautiful in its own way. Beauty value ofi-th city equals toci.All the cities are consecutively connected by the roads, including1-st andn-th city, forming a cyclic route1 — 2 — ... —n— 1. Formally, for every1 ≤i<nthere is a road betweeni-th andi+ 1-th city, and another one between1-st andn-th city.Each capital city is connected with each other city directly by the roads. Formally, if cityxis a capital city, then for every1 ≤i≤n,i≠x, there is a road between citiesxandi.There isat most oneroad between any two cities.Price of passing a road directly depends on beauty values of cities it connects. Thus if there is a road between citiesiandj, price of passing it equalsci·cj.Mishka started to gather her things for a trip, but didn't still decide which route to follow and thus she asked you to help her determine summary price of passingeach of the roadsin XXX. Formally, for every pair of citiesaandb(a<b), such that there is a road betweenaandbyou are to find sum of productsca·cb. Will you help her?InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandk(3 ≤n≤ 100 000, 1 ≤k≤n) — the number of cities in XXX and the number of capital cities among them.The second line of the input containsnintegersc1,c2, ...,cn(1 ≤ci≤ 10 000) — beauty values of the cities.The third line of the input containskdistinct integersid1,id2, ...,idk(1 ≤idi≤n) — indices of capital cities.
