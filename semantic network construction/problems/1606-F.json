Tree Queriestime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. Recall that a tree is an undirected connected acyclic graph. The given tree is rooted at the vertex $$$1$$$.You have to process $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, you are given a vertex of the tree $$$v$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$.To process a query, you may delete any vertices from the tree in any order, except for the root and the vertex $$$v$$$. When a vertex is deleted, its children become the children of its parent. You have to process a query in such a way that maximizes the value of $$$c(v) - m \\\\cdot k$$$ (where $$$c(v)$$$ is the resulting number of children of the vertex $$$v$$$, and $$$m$$$ is the number of vertices you have deleted). Print the maximum possible value you can obtain.The queries are independent: the changes you make to the tree while processing a query don't affect the tree in other queries.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.Then $$$n-1$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le n$$$; $$$x_i \\\\ne y_i$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th edge. These edges form a tree.The next line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, the $$$j$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$v_j$$$ and $$$k_j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v_j \\\\le n$$$; $$$0 \\\\le k_j \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the parameters of the $$$j$$$-th query.OutputFor each query, print one integer — the maximum value of $$$c(v) - m \\\\cdot k$$$ you can achieve.ExampleInput8 6 7 3 2 8 3 5 7 7 4 7 1 7 3 6 1 0 1 2 1 3 7 1 5 0 7 200000Output5 2 1 4 0 4NoteThe tree in the first example is shown in the following picture:Answers to the queries are obtained as follows:$$$v=1,k=0$$$: you can delete vertices $$$7$$$ and $$$3$$$, so the vertex $$$1$$$ has $$$5$$$ children (vertices $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$, and $$$8$$$), and the score is $$$5 - 2 \\\\cdot 0 = 5$$$;$$$v=1,k=2$$$: you can delete the vertex $$$7$$$, so the vertex $$$1$$$ has $$$4$$$ children (vertices $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, and $$$6$$$), and the score is $$$4 - 1 \\\\cdot 2 = 2$$$.$$$v=1,k=3$$$: you shouldn't delete any vertices, so the vertex $$$1$$$ has only one child (vertex $$$7$$$), and the score is $$$1 - 0 \\\\cdot 3 = 1$$$;$$$v=7,k=1$$$: you can delete the vertex $$$3$$$, so the vertex $$$7$$$ has $$$5$$$ children (vertices $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$, and $$$8$$$), and the score is $$$5 - 1 \\\\cdot 1 = 4$$$;$$$v=5,k=0$$$: no matter what you do, the vertex $$$5$$$ will have no children, so the score is $$$0$$$;$$$v=7,k=200000$$$: you shouldn't delete any vertices, so the vertex $$$7$$$ has $$$4$$$ children (vertices $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, and $$$6$$$), and the score is $$$4 - 0 \\\\cdot 200000 = 4$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "68aa61e4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ vertices.
