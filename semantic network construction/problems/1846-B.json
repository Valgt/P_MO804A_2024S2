Rudolph and Tic-Tac-Toetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRudolph invented the game of tic-tac-toe for three players. It has classic rules, except for the third player who plays with pluses. Rudolf has a $$$3 \\\\times 3$$$ field  — the result of the completed game. Each field cell contains either a cross, or a nought, or a plus sign, or nothing. The game is won by the player who makes a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of $$$3$$$'s of their symbols.Rudolph wants to find the result of the game. Either exactly one of the three players won or it ended in a draw. It is guaranteed that multiple players cannot win at the same time.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of three lines, each of which consists of three characters. The symbol can be one of four: \"X\" means a cross, \"O\" means a nought, \"+\" means a plus, \".\" means an empty cell.OutputFor each test case, print the string \"X\" if the crosses won, \"O\" if the noughts won, \"+\" if the pluses won, \"DRAW\" if there was a draw.ExampleInput5+X+OXOOX.O+.+OXX+O.XOOX.+++O.+X.O+...++X.O+..OutputX O + DRAW DRAW", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c01a8f90", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a 3x3 grid representing a tic-tac-toe board.
