Kefa and Watchtime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOne day Kefa the parrot was walking down the street as he was on the way home from the restaurant when he saw something glittering by the road. As he came nearer he understood that it was a watch. He decided to take it to the pawnbroker to earn some money.The pawnbroker said that each watch contains a serial number represented by a string of digits from0to9, and the more quality checks this number passes, the higher is the value of the watch. The check is defined by three positive integersl,randd. The watches pass a check if a substring of the serial number fromltorhas periodd. Sometimes the pawnbroker gets distracted and Kefa changes in some substring of the serial number all digits tocin order to increase profit from the watch.The seller has a lot of things to do to begin with and with Kefa messing about, he gave you a task: to write a program that determines the value of the watch.Let us remind you that numberxis called a period of strings(1 ≤x≤ |s|), ifsi=si+xfor allifrom 1 to|s|  -x.InputThe first line of the input contains three positive integersn,mandk(1 ≤n≤ 105,1 ≤m+k≤ 105) — the length of the serial number, the number of change made by Kefa and the number of quality checks.The second line contains a serial number consisting ofndigits.Thenm+klines follow, containing either checks or changes.The changes are given as 1lrc(1 ≤l≤r≤n,0 ≤c≤ 9). That means that Kefa changed all the digits from thel-th to ther-th to bec.The checks are given as 2lrd(1 ≤l≤r≤n,1 ≤d≤r-l+ 1).OutputFor each check on a single line print \"YES\" if the watch passed it, otherwise print \"NO\".ExamplesInput3 1 21122 2 3 11 1 3 82 1 2 1OutputNOYESInput6 2 33349342 2 5 21 4 4 32 1 6 31 2 3 82 3 6 1OutputNOYESNONoteIn the first sample test two checks will be made. In the first one substring \"12\" is checked on whether or not it has period 1, so the answer is \"NO\". In the second one substring \"88\", is checked on whether or not it has period 1, and it has this period, so the answer is \"YES\".In the second statement test three checks will be made. The first check processes substring \"3493\", which doesn't have period 2. Before the second check the string looks as \"334334\", so the answer to it is \"YES\". And finally, the third check processes substring \"8334\", which does not have period 1.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b5ed7339", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string representing a serial number of length $n$.
