Robin Hood in Towntime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn Sherwood, we judge a man not by his wealth, but by his merit.Look around, the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer. We need to take from the rich and give to the poor. We need Robin Hood!There are $$$n$$$ people living in the town. Just now, the wealth of the $$$i$$$-th person was $$$a_i$$$ gold. But guess what? The richest person has found an extra pot of gold!More formally, find an $$$a_j=max(a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n)$$$, change $$$a_j$$$ to $$$a_j+x$$$, where $$$x$$$ is a non-negative integer number of gold found in the pot. If there are multiple maxima, it can be any one of them.A person is unhappy if their wealth isstrictly less than halfof the average wealth$$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$$.Ifstrictly more than halfof the total population $$$n$$$ are unhappy, Robin Hood will appear by popular demand.Determine the minimum value of $$$x$$$ for Robin Hood to appear, or output $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.$$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$$The average wealth is defined as the total wealth divided by the total population $$$n$$$, that is, $$$\\\\frac{\\\\sum a_i}{n}$$$, the result is a real number.InputThe first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) — the total population.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the wealth of each person.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of gold that the richest person must find for Robin Hood to appear. If it is impossible, output $$$-1$$$ instead.ExampleInput61222 1931 3 2041 2 3 451 2 3 4 561 2 1 1 1 25Output-1 -1 0 15 16 0NoteIn the first test case, it is impossible for a single person to be unhappy.In the second test case, there is always $$$1$$$ happy person (the richest).In the third test case, no additional gold are required, so the answer is $$$0$$$.In the fourth test case, after adding $$$15$$$ gold, the average wealth becomes $$$\\\\frac{25}{4}$$$, and half of this average is $$$\\\\frac{25}{8}$$$, resulting in $$$3$$$ people being unhappy.In the fifth test case, after adding $$$16$$$ gold, the average wealth becomes $$$\\\\frac{31}{5}$$$, resulting in $$$3$$$ people being unhappy.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b4463d94", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ representing the wealth of $n$ people.  \n\nFind the minimum amount of gold $x$ that needs to be added to the wealth of the richest person ($a_j = \\max(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$) so that more than half of the people become unhappy.
