Display The Numbertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a large electronic screen which can display up to $$$998244353$$$ decimal digits. The digits are displayed in the same way as on different electronic alarm clocks: each place for a digit consists of $$$7$$$ segments which can be turned on and off to compose different digits. The following picture describes how you can display all $$$10$$$ decimal digits:As you can see, different digits may require different number of segments to be turned on. For example, if you want to display $$$1$$$, you have to turn on $$$2$$$ segments of the screen, and if you want to display $$$8$$$, all $$$7$$$ segments of some place to display a digit should be turned on.You want to display a really large integer on the screen. Unfortunately, the screen is bugged: no more than $$$n$$$ segments can be turned on simultaneously. So now you wonder what is the greatest integer that can be displayed by turning on no more than $$$n$$$ segments.Your program should be able to process $$$t$$$ different test cases.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases in the input.Then the test cases follow, each of them is represented by a separate line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the maximum number of segments that can be turned on in the corresponding testcase.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the greatest integer that can be displayed by turning on no more than $$$n$$$ segments of the screen. Note that the answer may not fit in the standard $$$32$$$-bit or $$$64$$$-bit integral data type.ExampleInput2 3 4Output7 11", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "738190f9", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You have a display with a limited number of lights.
