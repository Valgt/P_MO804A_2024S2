So he invented a new game.Initially you have a sequence ofnintegers:1, 2, ...,n. In a single step, you can pick two of them, let's denote themaandb, erase them from the sequence, and append to the sequence eithera+b, ora-b, ora×b.Aftern- 1steps there is only one number left. Can you make this number equal to24?InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 105).OutputIf it's possible, print \"YES\" in the first line. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).If there is a way to obtain24as the result number, in the followingn- 1lines print the required operations an operation per line. Each operation should be in form: \"aopb=c\". Whereaandbare the numbers you've picked at this operation;opis either \"+\", or \"-\", or \"*\";cis the result of corresponding operation. Note, that the absolute value ofcmustn't be greater than1018. The result of the last operation must be equal to24. Separate operator sign and equality sign from numbers with spaces.If there are multiple valid answers, you may print any of them.ExamplesInput1OutputNOInput8OutputYES8 * 7 = 566 * 5 = 303 - 4 = -11 - 2 = -130 - -1 = 3156 - 31 = 2525 + -1 = 24", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "74ea35f3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of numbers from 1 to $n$.
