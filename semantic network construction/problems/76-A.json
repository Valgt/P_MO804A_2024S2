Gifttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe kingdom of Olympia consists ofNcities andMbidirectional roads. Each road connects exactly two cities and two cities can be connected with more than one road. Also it possible that some roads connect city with itself making a loop.All roads are constantly plundered with bandits. After a while bandits became bored of wasting time in road robberies, so they suggested the king of Olympia to pay off. According to the offer, bandits want to get a gift consisted of gold and silver coins. Offer also contains a list of restrictions: for each road it is knowngi— the smallest amount of gold andsi— the smallest amount of silver coins that should be in the gift to stop robberies on the road. That is, if the gift containsagold andbsilver coins, then bandits will stop robberies on all the roads thatgi≤aandsi≤b.Unfortunately kingdom treasury doesn't contain neither gold nor silver coins, but there are Olympian tugriks in it. The cost of one gold coin in tugriks isG, and the cost of one silver coin in tugriks isS. King really wants to send bandits such gift that for any two cities there will exist a safe path between them. Your task is to find the minimal cost in Olympian tugriks of the required gift.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersNandM(2 ≤N≤ 200,1 ≤M≤ 50 000) — the number of cities and the number of roads, respectively. The second line contains two integersGandS(1 ≤G,S≤ 109) — the prices of gold and silver coins in tugriks. The followingMlines contain information about the offer. Each of the records in list is given as four integersxi,yi,gi,si, wherexiandyiare the numbers of cities that the road connects andgi,siare minimal gold and silver coins requirements for thei-th road (1 ≤xi,yi≤N,1 ≤gi,si≤ 109). Cities are numbered from1toN. It is possible that there are more than one road between a pair of cities. It is possible that a road connects the city with itself.OutputThe output should contain the minimal cost of the gift in Olympian tugriks. If there is no gift that satisfies the given requirements output.ExamplesInput3 32 11 2 10 151 2 4 201 3 5 1Output30", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5ffb4973", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $N$ cities and $M$ roads connecting them.
