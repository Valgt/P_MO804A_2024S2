In other words, the sequencescan be derived from the sequenceaby crossing out some elements.You are given two sequences of integer numbers. You are to find their longest common increasing subsequence, i.e. an increasing sequence of maximum length that is the subsequence of both sequences.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 500) — the length of the first sequence. The second line containsnspace-separated integers from the range[0, 109]— elements of the first sequence. The third line contains an integerm(1 ≤m≤ 500) — the length of the second sequence. The fourth line containsmspace-separated integers from the range[0, 109]— elements of the second sequence.OutputIn the first line outputk— the length of the longest common increasing subsequence. In the second line output the subsequence itself. Separate the elements with a space. If there are several solutions, output any.ExamplesInput72 3 1 6 5 4 641 3 5 6Output33 5 6Input51 2 0 2 131 0 1Output20 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "bcb500f0", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two sequences of integers.
