TV Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThere is a new TV game on BerTV. In this game two players get a numberAconsisting of2ndigits. Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactlynmoves. On it's turni-th player takes the leftmost digit ofAand appends it to his or her numberSi. After that this leftmost digit is erased fromA. Initially the numbers of both players (S1andS2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbersA,S1,S2are allowed. In the end of the game the first player getsS1dollars, and the second getsS2dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the numberAbeforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactlynmoves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 18). The second line contains integerAconsisting of exactly2ndigits. This number can have leading zeroes.OutputOutput the line of2ncharacters«H»and«M»— the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactlynmoves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.ExamplesInput21234OutputHHMMInput29911OutputHMHM", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a29f24f1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Two players take turns in a game.  \n\n* They are given a 2-digit number $A$.\n* On each turn, a player takes the leftmost digit of $A$, adds it to their own number, and removes it from $A$.\n* Each player makes $n$ moves.\n* The player with the larger number at the end wins.\n\nGiven $n$ and $A$, determine a sequence of moves for the players that maximizes the sum of their final numbers."}, {"prompt_md5": "b9c09d03", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Two players take turns removing the leftmost digit from a given number and adding it to their own number.
