We'd like to find aninteger point$$$B$$$ (also on $$$OX$$$-axis), such that theabsolute differencebetween the distance from $$$O$$$ to $$$B$$$ and the distance from $$$A$$$ to $$$B$$$ is equal to $$$k$$$.The description of the first test case.Since sometimes it's impossible to find such point $$$B$$$, we can, in one step, increase or decrease the coordinate of $$$A$$$ by $$$1$$$. What is the minimum number of steps we should do to make such point $$$B$$$ exist?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 6000$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le n, k \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the initial position of point $$$A$$$ and desirable absolute difference.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum number of steps to make point $$$B$$$ exist.ExampleInput6 4 0 5 8 0 1000000 0 0 1 0 1000000 1000000Output0 3 1000000 0 1 0NoteIn the first test case (picture above), if we set the coordinate of $$$B$$$ as $$$2$$$ then the absolute difference will be equal to $$$|(2 - 0) - (4 - 2)| = 0$$$ and we don't have to move $$$A$$$. So the answer is $$$0$$$.In the second test case, we can increase the coordinate of $$$A$$$ by $$$3$$$ and set the coordinate of $$$B$$$ as $$$0$$$ or $$$8$$$. The absolute difference will be equal to $$$|8 - 0| = 8$$$, so the answer is $$$3$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "611a5fc6", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a point $A$ on the x-axis with coordinate $n$.
