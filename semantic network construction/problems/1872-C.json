For example, $$$\\\\gcd(6, 9) = 3$$$, $$$\\\\gcd(8, 9) = 1$$$, $$$\\\\gcd(4, 2) = 2$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases.Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.The only line of the description of each test case contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$l, r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le 10^7$$$).OutputFor each test case, output the integers $$$a, b$$$ that satisfy all the conditions on a separate line. If there is no answer, instead output a single number $$$-1$$$.If there are multiple answers, you can output any of them.ExampleInput1111 151 318 1941 43777 7778000000 100000002000 20231791791 17917911 42 39840769 9840769Output6 9 -1 14 4 36 6 111 666 4000000 5000000  2009 7 -1 2 2 -1 6274 9834495NoteIn the first test case, $$$11 \\\\le 6 + 9 \\\\le 15$$$, $$$\\\\gcd(6, 9) = 3$$$, and all conditions are satisfied.
