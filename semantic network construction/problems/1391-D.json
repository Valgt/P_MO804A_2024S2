If the $$$j$$$-th character on the $$$i$$$-th line is1, then $$$a_{i,j} = 1$$$. Similarly, if the $$$j$$$-th character on the $$$i$$$-th line is0, then $$$a_{i,j} = 0$$$.OutputOutput the minimum number of cells you need to change to make $$$a$$$ good, or output $$$-1$$$ if it's not possible at all.ExamplesInput3 3 101 001 110Output2Input7 15 000100001010010 100111010110001 101101111100100 010000111111010 111010010100001 000011001111101 111111011010011Output-1NoteIn the first case, changing $$$a_{1,1}$$$ to $$$0$$$ and $$$a_{2,2}$$$ to $$$1$$$ is enough.You can verify that there is no way to make the matrix in the second case good.Some definitions —A binary matrix is one in which every element is either $$$1$$$ or $$$0$$$.A sub-matrix is described by $$$4$$$ parameters — $$$r_1$$$, $$$r_2$$$, $$$c_1$$$, and $$$c_2$$$; here, $$$1 \\\\leq r_1 \\\\leq r_2 \\\\leq n$$$ and $$$1 \\\\leq c_1 \\\\leq c_2 \\\\leq m$$$.This sub-matrix contains all elements $$$a_{i,j}$$$ that satisfy both $$$r_1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq r_2$$$ and $$$c_1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq c_2$$$.A sub-matrix is, further, called an even length square if $$$r_2-r_1 = c_2-c_1$$$ and $$$r_2-r_1+1$$$ is divisible by $$$2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f207ffb7", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a matrix of 0s and 1s.
