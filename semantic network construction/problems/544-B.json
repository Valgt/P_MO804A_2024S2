Each cell is initially occupied by the sea but you can cover some some cells of the map with sand so that exactlykislands appear on the map. We will call a set of sand cells to beislandif it is possible to get from each of them to each of them by moving only through sand cells and by moving from a cell only to a side-adjacent cell. The cells are called to be side-adjacent if they share a vertical or horizontal side.
