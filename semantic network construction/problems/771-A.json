Bear and Friendship Conditiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBear Limak examines a social network. Its main functionality is that two members can become friends (then they can talk with each other and share funny pictures).There arenmembers, numbered1throughn.mpairs of members are friends. Of course, a member can't be a friend with themselves.LetA-Bdenote that membersAandBare friends. Limak thinks that a network isreasonableif and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every threedistinctmembers (X,Y,Z), ifX-YandY-Zthen alsoX-Z.For example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.Can you help Limak and check if the network is reasonable? Print \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly, without the quotes.InputThe first line of the input contain two integersnandm(3 ≤n≤ 150 000,) — the number of members and the number of pairs of members that are friends.Thei-th of the nextmlines contains two distinct integersaiandbi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi). Membersaiandbiare friends with each other. No pair of members will appear more than once in the input.OutputIf the given network is reasonable, print \"YES\" in a single line (without the quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" in a single line (without the quotes).ExamplesInput4 31 33 41 4OutputYESInput4 43 12 33 41 2OutputNOInput10 44 35 108 91 2OutputYESInput3 21 22 3OutputNONoteThe drawings below show the situation in the first sample (on the left) and in the second sample (on the right).
