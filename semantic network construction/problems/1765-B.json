Broken Keyboardtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecently, Mishka started noticing that his keyboard malfunctions — maybe it's because he was playing rhythm games too much. Empirically, Mishka has found out that every other time he presses a key, it is registered as if the key was pressed twice. For example, if Mishka types text, the first time he presses a key, exactly one letter is printed; the second time he presses a key, two same letters are printed; the third time he presses a key, one letter is printed; the fourth time he presses a key, two same letters are printed, and so on. Note that the number of times a key was pressed is counted for the whole keyboard, not for each key separately. For example, if Mishka tries to type the wordosu, it will be printed on the screen asossu.You are given a word consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters. You have to determine if it can be printed on Mishka's keyboard or not. You may assume that Mishka cannot delete letters from the word, and every time he presses a key, the new letter (or letters) is appended to the end of the word.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the length of the word.The second line of the test case contains a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters — the word that should be checked.OutputFor each test case, printYESif the word $$$s$$$ can be printed on Mishka's keyboard, andNOotherwise.ExampleInput44ossu2aa6addonn3qweOutputYES NO YES NONoteIn the first test case, Mishka can type the word as follows: presso(one letteroappears at the end of the word), then pressess(two letterssappear at the end of the word), and, finally, pressu(one letter appears at the end of the word, making the resulting wordossu).In the second test case, Mishka can try typing the word as follows: pressa(one letteraappears at the end of the word). But if he tries to pressaone more time, two lettersawill appear at the end of the word, so it is impossible to print the word using his keyboard.In the fourth test case, Mishka has to start by pressingq. Then, if he pressesw, two copies ofwwill appear at the end of the word, but the third letter should beeinstead ofw, so the answer isNO.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "67f5ef23", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "A keyboard has a bug: every other key press registers as two key presses.  \n\nGiven a word, determine if it can be typed on this broken keyboard.
