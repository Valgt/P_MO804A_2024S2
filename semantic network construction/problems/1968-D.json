Permutation Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBodya and Sasha found a permutation $$$p_1,\\\\dots,p_n$$$ and an array $$$a_1,\\\\dots,a_n$$$. They decided to play a well-known \"Permutation game\".A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.The game lasts $$$k$$$ turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn, two things happen to each player:If the current position of the player is $$$x$$$, his score increases by $$$a_x$$$.Then the player eitherstaysat his current position $$$x$$$ ormovesfrom $$$x$$$ to $$$p_x$$$.The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly $$$k$$$ turns.Knowing Bodya's starting position $$$P_B$$$ and Sasha's starting position $$$P_S$$$, determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$P_B$$$, $$$P_S$$$ ($$$1\\\\le P_B,P_S\\\\le n\\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\\\le k\\\\le 10^9$$$) — length of the permutation, duration of the game, starting positions respectively.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,\\\\dots,p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$) — elements of the permutation $$$p$$$.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,\\\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le a_i\\\\le 10^9$$$) — elements of array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase output:\"Bodya\" if Bodya wins the game.\"Sasha\" if Sasha wins the game.\"Draw\" if the players have the same score.ExampleInput104 2 3 24 1 2 37 2 5 610 8 2 103 1 4 5 2 7 8 10 6 95 10 5 1 3 7 10 15 4 32 1000000000 1 21 24 48 10 4 15 1 4 3 2 8 6 71 1 2 1 2 100 101 1025 1 2 51 2 4 5 34 6 9 4 24 2 3 14 1 3 26 8 5 36 9 5 46 1 3 5 2 46 9 8 9 5 104 8 4 22 3 4 15 2 8 74 2 3 14 1 3 26 8 5 32 1000000000 1 21 21000000000 2OutputBodya Sasha Draw Draw Bodya Sasha Sasha Sasha Sasha BodyaNoteBelow you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game consists of $$$k=2$$$ turns.TurnBodya's positionBodya's scoreBodya's moveSasha's positionSasha's scoreSasha's movefirst$$$3$$$$$$0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5$$$stays on the same position$$$2$$$$$$0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2$$$moves to $$$p_2=1$$$second$$$3$$$$$$5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10$$$stays on the same position$$$1$$$$$$2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9$$$stays on the same positionfinal results$$$3$$$$$$10$$$$$$1$$$$$$9$$$As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game.
