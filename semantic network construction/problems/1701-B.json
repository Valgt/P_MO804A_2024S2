Permutationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecall that a permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once.For a fixed positive integer $$$d$$$, let's define the cost of the permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ as the number of indices $$$i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le i < n)$$$ such that $$$p_i \\\\cdot d = p_{i + 1}$$$.For example, if $$$d = 3$$$ and $$$p = [5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 3, 4]$$$, then the cost of such a permutation is $$$2$$$, because $$$p_2 \\\\cdot 3 = p_3$$$ and $$$p_5 \\\\cdot 3 = p_6$$$.Your task is the following one: for a given value $$$n$$$, find the permutation of length $$$n$$$ and the value $$$d$$$ with maximum possible cost (over all ways to choose the permutation and $$$d$$$). If there are multiple answers, then print any of them.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases.The single line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the value $$$d$$$ in the first line, and $$$n$$$ integers in the second line — the permutation itself.
