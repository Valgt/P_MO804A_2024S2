Anti-Fibonacci Permutationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$anti-Fibonacciif the condition $$$p_{i-2} + p_{i-1} \\\\ne p_i$$$ holds for all $$$i$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$). Recall that the permutation is the array of length $$$n$$$ which contains each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once.Your task is for a given number $$$n$$$ print $$$n$$$distinctanti-Fibonacci permutations of length $$$n$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 48$$$) — the number of test cases.The single line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$).OutputFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ lines. Each line should contain an anti-Fibonacci permutation of length $$$n$$$. In each test case, you cannot print any permutation more than once.If there are multiple answers, print any of them. It can be shown that it is always possible to find $$$n$$$ different anti-Fibonacci permutations of size $$$n$$$ under the constraints of the problem.ExampleInput243Output4 1 3 2 1 2 4 3 3 4 1 2 2 4 1 3 3 2 1 1 3 2 3 1 2", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e75b0d26", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a number  $n$.  \n\nYour task is to find $n$ different arrangements (permutations) of the numbers from 1 to $n$ that follow this rule:\n\nFor each number in the arrangement, except the first two, the sum of the two numbers before it must not equal the current number.\n\nPrint each arrangement on a separate line."}, {"prompt_md5": "116e8a37", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number n, find n different arrangements of numbers from 1 to n where the sum of the two previous numbers in the arrangement is never equal to the current number."}]}
