Robot Queriestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is an infinite $$$2$$$-dimensional grid. Initially, a robot stands in the point $$$(0, 0)$$$. The robot can execute four commands:U— move from point $$$(x, y)$$$ to $$$(x, y + 1)$$$;D— move from point $$$(x, y)$$$ to $$$(x, y - 1)$$$;L— move from point $$$(x, y)$$$ to $$$(x - 1, y)$$$;R— move from point $$$(x, y)$$$ to $$$(x + 1, y)$$$.You are given a sequence of commands $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Your task is to answer $$$q$$$independentqueries: given four integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$; determine whether the robot visits the point $$$(x, y)$$$, while executing a sequence $$$s$$$, but the substring from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ is reversed (i. e. the robot performs commands in order $$$s_1 s_2 s_3 \\\\dots s_{l-1} s_r s_{r-1} s_{r-2} \\\\dots s_l s_{r+1} s_{r+2} \\\\dots s_n$$$).InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the command sequence and the number of queries, respectively.The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of charactersU,D,Land/orR.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains four integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$, $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$-n \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le n$$$; $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$) describing the $$$i$$$-th query.OutputFor each query, printYESif the robot visits the point $$$(x, y)$$$, while executing a sequence $$$s$$$, but the substring from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ is reversed; otherwise printNO.ExamplesInput8 3RDLLUURU-1 2 1 70 0 3 40 1 7 8OutputYES YES NOInput4 2RLDU0 0 2 2-1 -1 2 3OutputYES NOInput10 6DLUDLRULLD-1 0 1 10-1 -2 2 5-4 -2 6 10-1 0 3 90 1 4 7-3 -1 5 8OutputYES YES YES NO YES YESNoteIn the first query of the first sample, the path of the robot looks as follows:In the second query of the first sample, the path of the robot looks as follows:In the third query of the first sample, the path of the robot looks as follows:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "dad648d1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "A robot starts at position $(0,0)$ on an infinite 2D grid.
