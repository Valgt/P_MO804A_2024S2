Data Recoverytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutNot so long ago company R2 bought company R1 and consequently, all its developments in the field of multicore processors. Now the R2 laboratory is testing one of the R1 processors.The testing goes innsteps, at each step the processor gets some instructions, and then its temperature is measured. The head engineer in R2 is keeping a report record on the work of the processor: he writes down the minimum and the maximum measured temperature in his notebook. His assistant had to write down all temperatures into his notebook, but (for unknown reasons) he recorded onlym.The next day, the engineer's assistant filed in a report with all themtemperatures. However, the chief engineer doubts that the assistant wrote down everything correctly (naturally, the chief engineer doesn't doubt his notes). So he asked you to help him. Given numbersn,m,min,maxand the list ofmtemperatures determine whether you can upgrade the set ofmtemperatures to the set ofntemperatures (that is addn-mtemperatures), so that the minimum temperature wasminand the maximum one wasmax.InputThe first line contains four integersn,m,min,max(1 ≤m<n≤ 100; 1 ≤min<max≤ 100). The second line containsmspace-separated integersti(1 ≤ti≤ 100)— the temperatures reported by the assistant.Note, that the reported temperatures, and the temperatures you want to add can contain equal temperatures.OutputIf the data is consistent, print 'Correct' (without the quotes). Otherwise, print 'Incorrect' (without the quotes).ExamplesInput2 1 1 21OutputCorrectInput3 1 1 32OutputCorrectInput2 1 1 32OutputIncorrectNoteIn the first test sample one of the possible initial configurations of temperatures is [1, 2].In the second test sample one of the possible initial configurations of temperatures is [2, 1, 3].In the third test sample it is impossible to add one temperature to obtain the minimum equal to 1 and the maximum equal to 3.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ebadcc0d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given:\n\n*  $n$: the total number of temperatures recorded.\n*  $m$: the number of temperatures reported by the assistant.\n*  $min$: the minimum temperature recorded.\n*  $max$: the maximum temperature recorded.\n*  A list of $m$ temperatures reported by the assistant.\n\nDetermine if it is possible to add $n-m$ temperatures to the assistant's list so that:\n\n* The minimum temperature in the complete list is $min$.\n* The maximum temperature in the complete list is $max$.\n\nIf it is possible, output \"Correct\".
