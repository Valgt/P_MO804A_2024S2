Boundarytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBethany would like to tile her bathroom. The bathroom has width $$$w$$$ centimeters and length $$$l$$$ centimeters. If Bethany simply used the basic tiles of size $$$1 \\\\times 1$$$ centimeters, she would use $$$w \\\\cdot l$$$ of them.However, she has something different in mind.On the interior of the floor she wants to use the $$$1 \\\\times 1$$$ tiles. She needs exactly $$$(w-2) \\\\cdot (l-2)$$$ of these.On the floor boundary she wants to use tiles of size $$$1 \\\\times a$$$ for some positive integer $$$a$$$. The tiles can also be rotated by $$$90$$$ degrees.For which values of $$$a$$$ can Bethany tile the bathroom floor as described? Note that $$$a$$$ can also be $$$1$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case consist of a single line, which contains two integers $$$w$$$, $$$l$$$ ($$$3 \\\\leq w, l \\\\leq 10^{9}$$$) — the dimensions of the bathroom.OutputFor each test case, print an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\\\le k$$$) — the number of valid values of $$$a$$$ for the given test case — followed by $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\\\dots, a_k$$$ ($$$1\\\\le a_i$$$) — the valid values of $$$a$$$.
