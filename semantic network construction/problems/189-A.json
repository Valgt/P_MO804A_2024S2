He wants to cut the ribbon in a way that fulfils the following two conditions:After the cutting each ribbon piece should have lengtha,borc.After the cutting the number of ribbon pieces should be maximum.Help Polycarpus and find the number of ribbon pieces after the required cutting.InputThe first line contains four space-separated integersn,a,bandc(1 ≤n,a,b,c≤ 4000)— the length of the original ribbon and the acceptable lengths of the ribbon pieces after the cutting, correspondingly. The numbersa,bandccan coincide.OutputPrint a single number — the maximum possible number of ribbon pieces. It is guaranteed that at least one correct ribbon cutting exists.ExamplesInput5 5 3 2Output2Input7 5 5 2Output2NoteIn the first example Polycarpus can cut the ribbon in such way: the first piece has length 2, the second piece has length 3.In the second example Polycarpus can cut the ribbon in such way: the first piece has length 5, the second piece has length 2.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f8c86ef8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a ribbon of length $n$.
