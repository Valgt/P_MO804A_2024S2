Preparation for International Women's Daytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputInternational Women's Day is coming soon! Polycarp is preparing for the holiday.There are $$$n$$$ candy boxes in the shop for sale. The $$$i$$$-th box contains $$$d_i$$$ candies.Polycarp wants to prepare the maximum number of gifts for $$$k$$$ girls. Each gift will consist ofexactly twoboxes. The girls should be able to share each gift equally, so the total amount of candies in a gift (in a pair of boxes) should be divisible by $$$k$$$. In other words, two boxes $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \\\\ne j$$$) can be combined as a gift if $$$d_i + d_j$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$.How many boxes will Polycarp be able to give? Of course, each box can be a part of no more than one gift. Polycarp cannot use boxes \"partially\" or redistribute candies between them.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5, 1 \\\\le k \\\\le 100$$$) — the number the boxes and the number the girls.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\\\dots, d_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le d_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$d_i$$$ is the number of candies in the $$$i$$$-th box.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum number of the boxes Polycarp can give as gifts.ExamplesInput7 2 1 2 2 3 2 4 10Output6Input8 2 1 2 2 3 2 4 6 10Output8Input7 3 1 2 2 3 2 4 5Output4NoteIn the first example Polycarp can give the following pairs of boxes (pairs are presented byindices of corresponding boxes):$$$(2, 3)$$$;$$$(5, 6)$$$;$$$(1, 4)$$$.So the answer is $$$6$$$.In the second example Polycarp can give the following pairs of boxes (pairs are presented byindices of corresponding boxes):$$$(6, 8)$$$;$$$(2, 3)$$$;$$$(1, 4)$$$;$$$(5, 7)$$$.So the answer is $$$8$$$.In the third example Polycarp can give the following pairs of boxes (pairs are presented byindices of corresponding boxes):$$$(1, 2)$$$;$$$(6, 7)$$$.So the answer is $$$4$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f60c4897", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ boxes of candy, each containing a different number of candies.
