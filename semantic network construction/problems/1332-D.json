Walk on Matrixtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBob is playing a game named \"Walk on Matrix\".In this game, player is given an $$$n \\\\times m$$$ matrix $$$A=(a_{i,j})$$$, i.e. the element in the $$$i$$$-th row in the $$$j$$$-th column is $$$a_{i,j}$$$. Initially, player is located at position $$$(1,1)$$$ with score $$$a_{1,1}$$$.To reach the goal, position $$$(n,m)$$$, player can move right or down, i.e. move from $$$(x,y)$$$ to $$$(x,y+1)$$$ or $$$(x+1,y)$$$, as long as player is still on the matrix.However, each move changes player's score to thebitwise ANDof the current score and the value at the position he moves to.Bob can't wait to find out the maximum score he can get using the tool he recently learnt  — dynamic programming. Here is his algorithm for this problem.However, he suddenly realize that the algorithm above fails to output the maximum score for some matrix $$$A$$$. Thus, for any given non-negative integer $$$k$$$, he wants to find out an $$$n \\\\times m$$$ matrix $$$A=(a_{i,j})$$$ such that$$$1 \\\\le n,m \\\\le 500$$$ (as Bob hates large matrix);$$$0 \\\\le a_{i,j} \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\le i\\\\le n,1 \\\\le j\\\\le m$$$ (as Bob hates large numbers);the difference between the maximum score he can get and the output of his algorithm isexactly$$$k$$$.It can be shown that for any given integer $$$k$$$ such that $$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^5$$$, there exists a matrix satisfying the above constraints.Please help him with it!InputThe only line of the input contains one single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^5$$$).OutputOutput two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n,m \\\\le 500$$$) in the first line, representing the size of the matrix.Then output $$$n$$$ lines with $$$m$$$ integers in each line, $$$a_{i,j}$$$ in the $$$(i+1)$$$-th row, $$$j$$$-th column.ExamplesInput0Output1 1 300000Input1Output3 4 7 3 3 1 4 8 3 6 7 7 7 3NoteIn the first example, the maximum score Bob can achieve is $$$300000$$$, while the output of his algorithm is $$$300000$$$.In the second example, the maximum score Bob can achieve is $$$7\\\\&3\\\\&3\\\\&3\\\\&7\\\\&3=3$$$, while the output of his algorithm is $$$2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "527aeec4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a non-negative integer $k$, find a matrix $A$ of size $n \\times m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 500$) with elements $a_{i,j}$ ($0 \\le a_{i,j} \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$) such that:\n\n* The difference between the maximum score achievable by traversing the matrix and the output of a specific algorithm (not provided) is exactly $k$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that such a matrix exists for all $0 \\le k \\le 10^5$.\n\nOutput the size of the matrix ($n$, $m$) followed by the matrix elements."}, {"prompt_md5": "ce6f03cb", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number *k*, find a matrix of size at most 500x500 with values between 0 and 300,000 where the difference between the maximum achievable score in the matrix and the score calculated by a specific algorithm is exactly *k*."}]}
