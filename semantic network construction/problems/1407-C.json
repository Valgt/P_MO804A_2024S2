Chocolate Bunnytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problem.We hid from you a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of the elements from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. You want to guess it. To do that, you can give us 2 different indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, and we will reply with $$$p_{i} \\\\bmod p_{j}$$$ (remainder of division $$$p_{i}$$$ by $$$p_{j}$$$).We have enough patience to answer at most $$$2 \\\\cdot n$$$ queries, so you should fit in this constraint. Can you do it?As a reminder, a permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).InputThe only line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^4$$$) â€” length of the permutation.InteractionThe interaction starts with reading $$$n$$$.Then you are allowed to make at most $$$2 \\\\cdot n$$$ queries in the following way:\"? x y\" ($$$1 \\\\le x, y \\\\le n, x \\\\ne y$$$).After each one, you should read an integer $$$k$$$, that equals $$$p_x \\\\bmod p_y$$$.When you have guessed the permutation, print a single line \"!\" (without quotes), followed by array $$$p$$$ and quit.After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will getIdleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:fflush(stdout)orcout.flush()in C++;System.out.flush()in Java;flush(output)in Pascal;stdout.flush()in Python;see documentation for other languages.Exit immediately after receiving \"-1\" and you will seeWrong answerverdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.Hack formatIn the first line output $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^4$$$). In the second line print the permutation of $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$.ExampleInput3  1  2  1  0Output? 1 2  ? 3 2  ? 1 3  ? 2 1  ! 1 3 2", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8f2999fb", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a permutation of length $n$ (a sequence of $n$ distinct integers from 1 to $n$).
