You are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, which are the two largest divisors of the number $$$x$$$. At the same time, the condition $$$1 \\\\le a < b < x$$$ is satisfied.For the given numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, you need to find the value of $$$x$$$.$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$ The number $$$y$$$ is a divisor of the number $$$x$$$ if there is an integer $$$k$$$ such that $$$x = y \\\\cdot k$$$.InputEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.The only line of each test cases contains two integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a < b \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ are the two largest divisors for some number $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^9$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the number $$$x$$$, such that $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are the two largest divisors of the number $$$x$$$.If there are several answers, print any of them.ExampleInput82 31 23 111 55 104 63 9250000000 500000000Output6 4 33 25 20 12 27 1000000000NoteFor the first test case, all divisors less than $$$6$$$ are equal to $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, among them the two largest will be $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$.For the third test case, all divisors less than $$$33$$$ are equal to $$$[1, 3, 11]$$$, among them the two largest will be $$$3$$$ and $$$11$$$.For the fifth test case, all divisors less than $$$20$$$ are equal to $$$[1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$$$, among them the two largest will be $$$5$$$ and $$$10$$$.For the sixth test case, all divisors less than $$$12$$$ are equal to $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]$$$, among them the two largest will be $$$4$$$ and $$$6$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ca250bce", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers $a$ and $b$ where $1 \\le a < b$.
