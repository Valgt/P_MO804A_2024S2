Each of thenbooks should be assigned with a number from1ton. Naturally, distinct books should be assigned distinct numbers.Vanya wants to know how many digits he will have to write down as he labels the books.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 109) — the number of books in the library.OutputPrint the number of digits needed to number all the books.ExamplesInput13Output17Input4Output4NoteNote to the first test. The books get numbers1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, which totals to17digits.Note to the second sample.
