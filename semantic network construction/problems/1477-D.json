Nezzar and Hidden Permutationstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNezzar designs a brand new game \"Hidden Permutations\" and shares it with his best friend, Nanako.At the beginning of the game, Nanako and Nezzar both know integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. The game goes in the following way:Firstly, Nezzar hides two permutations $$$p_1,p_2,\\\\ldots,p_n$$$ and $$$q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots,q_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and Nanako secretly selects $$$m$$$ unordered pairs $$$(l_1,r_1),(l_2,r_2),\\\\ldots,(l_m,r_m)$$$;After that, Nanako sends his chosen pairs to Nezzar;On receiving those $$$m$$$ unordered pairs, Nezzar checks if there exists $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le m$$$, such that $$$(p_{l_i}-p_{r_i})$$$ and $$$(q_{l_i}-q_{r_i})$$$ have different signs. If so, Nezzar instantly loses the game and gets a score of $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, the score Nezzar gets is equal to the number of indices $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$ such that $$$p_i \\\\neq q_i$$$.However, Nezzar accidentally knows Nanako's unordered pairs and decides to take advantage of them. Please help Nezzar find out two permutations $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ such that the score is maximized.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n,m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5, 0 \\\\le m \\\\le \\\\min(\\\\frac{n(n-1)}{2},5 \\\\cdot 10^5)$$$).Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$l_i,r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i,r_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$l_i \\\\neq r_i$$$), describing the $$$i$$$-th unordered pair Nanako chooses. It is guaranteed that all $$$m$$$ unordered pairs are distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print two permutations $$$p_1,p_2,\\\\ldots,p_n$$$ and $$$q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots,q_n$$$ such that the score Nezzar gets is maximized.ExampleInput3 4 2 1 2 3 4 6 4 1 2 1 3 3 5 3 6 2 1 1 2Output1 2 3 4 3 4 1 2 2 3 4 1 6 5 1 4 3 2 5 6 1 2 1 2NoteFor first test case, for each pair given by Nanako:for the first pair $$$(1,2)$$$: $$$p_1 - p_2 = 1 - 2 = -1$$$, $$$q_1 - q_2 = 3 - 4 = -1$$$, they have the same sign;for the second pair $$$(3,4)$$$: $$$p_3 - p_4 = 3 - 4 = -1$$$, $$$q_3 - q_4 = 1 - 2 = -1$$$, they have the same sign.As Nezzar does not lose instantly, Nezzar gains the score of $$$4$$$ as $$$p_i \\\\neq q_i$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq 4$$$. Obviously, it is the maximum possible score Nezzar can get.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e9c91740", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers $n$ and $m$.
