Umka and a Long Flighttime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe girl Umka loves to travel and participate in math olympiads. One day she was flying by plane to the next olympiad and out of boredom explored a huge checkered sheet of paper.Denote the $$$n$$$-th Fibonacci number as $$$F_n = \\\\begin{cases} 1, & n = 0; \\\\\\\\ 1, & n = 1; \\\\\\\\ F_{n-2} + F_{n-1}, & n \\\\ge 2. \\\\end{cases}$$$A checkered rectangle with a height of $$$F_n$$$ and a width of $$$F_{n+1}$$$ is called a Fibonacci rectangleof order$$$n$$$.Umka has a Fibonacci rectangleof order$$$n$$$. Someone colored a cell in it at the intersection of the row $$$x$$$ and the column $$$y$$$.It is necessary to cut this rectangleexactlyinto $$$n+1$$$ squares in such way thatthe painted cell was in a square with a side of $$$1$$$;there wasat most onepair of squares with equal sides;the side of each square was equal to a Fibonacci number.Will Umka be able to cut this rectangle in that way?InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — number of test cases.For each test case the integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ are given ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 44$$$, $$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le F_n$$$, $$$1 \\\\le y \\\\le F_{n+1}$$$) —the orderof the Fibonacci rectangle and the coordinates of the colored cell.OutputFor each test case, print \"YES\" if the answer is positive, and \"NO\" otherwise.You can print \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\" and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput121 1 12 1 23 1 43 3 24 4 64 3 35 6 55 4 125 2 124 2 11 1 244 758465880 1277583853OutputYES NO YES YES YES NO YES NO NO YES YES NONoteThe first, third and fourth test cases.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1c66093a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a rectangle with a height of $F_n$ and a width of $F_{n+1}$, where $F_n$ is the nth Fibonacci number.
