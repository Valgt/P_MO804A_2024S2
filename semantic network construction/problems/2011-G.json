Removal of a Permutationtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$.You can perform operations of two types:mark all positions $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le i < n$$$ and $$$p_i < p_{i + 1}$$$, and simultaneously remove the elements at these positions;mark all positions $$$i$$$ such that $$$2 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$ and $$$p_{i - 1} > p_i$$$, and simultaneously remove the elements at these positions.For each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$(n-1)$$$, calculate the minimum number of operations required to remove that integer from the permutation.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 250\\\\,000$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$). The array $$$p$$$ is a permutation.Additional constraints on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$250\\\\,000$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$(n-1)$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th of them should be equal to the minimum number of operations required to remove $$$i$$$ from the permutation.ExampleInput544 2 1 321 265 4 1 3 2 675 6 1 3 7 2 453 1 2 5 4Output1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6147a3d2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of $n$ distinct numbers ($p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$).
