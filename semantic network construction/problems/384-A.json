Codertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutIahub likes chess very much. He even invented a new chess piece named Coder. A Coder can move (and attack) one square horizontally or vertically. More precisely, if the Coder is located at position(x,y), he can move to (or attack) positions(x+ 1,y),(x–1,y),(x,y+ 1)and(x,y–1).Iahub wants to know how many Coders can be placed on ann×nchessboard, so that no Coder attacks any other Coder.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 1000).OutputOn the first line print an integer, the maximum number of Coders that can be placed on the chessboard.On each of the nextnlines printncharacters, describing the configuration of the Coders.
