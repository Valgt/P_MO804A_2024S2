Aleksa and Stacktime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAfter the Serbian Informatics Olympiad, Aleksa was very sad, because he didn't win a medal (he didn't know stack), so Vasilije came to give him an easy problem, just to make his day better.Vasilije gave Aleksa a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$n \\\\ge 3$$$) and asked him to construct a strictly increasing array of size $$$n$$$ of positive integers, such that$$$3\\\\cdot a_{i+2}$$$ is not divisible by $$$a_i+a_{i+1}$$$ for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\\\le i \\\\le n-2$$$).Note that a strictly increasing array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ is an array where $$$a_i < a_{i+1}$$$ for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n-1$$$).Since Aleksa thinks he is a bad programmer now, he asked you to help him find such an array.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It can be proved that the solution exists for any $$$n$$$. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.ExampleInput3367Output6 8 12 7 11 14 20 22 100 9 15 18 27 36 90 120NoteIn the first test case, $$$a_1=6$$$, $$$a_2=8$$$, $$$a_3=12$$$, so $$$a_1+a_2=14$$$ and $$$3 \\\\cdot a_3=36$$$, so $$$3 \\\\cdot a_3$$$ is not divisible by $$$a_1+a_2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "47c7a48e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a positive integer $n$ ($n \\ge 3$), find a strictly increasing array of size $n$ of positive integers, such that  $3 \\cdot a_{i+2}$ is not divisible by $a_i + a_{i+1}$ for each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n-2$).\n\nHere, a strictly increasing array is an array where $a_i < a_{i+1}$ for each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n-1$). \n\nInput:\n\n* The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.\n* The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in the array.\n* It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nOutput:\n\n* For each test case, output $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$)."}, {"prompt_md5": "99036ad9", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a positive integer *n* (greater than or equal to 3), find a list of *n* increasing positive integers where three times the third number is not divisible by the sum of the first two numbers, and three times the *i*th number is not divisible by the sum of the *i-1*th and *i*th numbers for all *i* from 1 to *n-2*."}]}
