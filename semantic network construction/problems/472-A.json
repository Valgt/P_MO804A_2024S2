Design Tutorial: Learn from Mathtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutOne way to create a task is to learn from math. You can generate some random math statement or modify some theorems to get something new and build a new task from that.For example, there is a statement called the \"Goldbach's conjecture\". It says: \"each even number no less than four can be expressed as the sum of two primes\". Let's modify it. How about a statement like that: \"each integer no less than 12 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers.\" Not like the Goldbach's conjecture, I can prove this theorem.You are given an integernno less than 12, express it as a sum of two composite numbers.InputThe only line contains an integern(12 ≤n≤ 106).OutputOutput two composite integersxandy(1 <x,y<n)such thatx+y=n. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.ExamplesInput12Output4 8Input15Output6 9Input23Output8 15Input1000000Output500000 500000NoteIn the first example, 12 = 4 + 8 and both 4, 8 are composite numbers. You can output \"6 6\" or \"8 4\" as well.In the second example, 15 = 6 + 9. Note that you can't output \"1 14\" because 1 is not a composite number.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "79f66314", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an integer $n$ (where $12 \\le n \\le 10^6$), find two composite numbers $x$ and $y$ (where $1 < x, y < n$) such that $x + y = n$. \n\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, output any one."}, {"prompt_md5": "3728389f", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number greater than or equal to 12, find two smaller numbers that add up to the given number and are both not prime."}]}
