Beautiful Mirrorstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputCreatnx has $$$n$$$ mirrors, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Every day, Creatnx asks exactly one mirror \"Am I beautiful?\". The $$$i$$$-th mirror will tell Creatnx that he is beautiful with probability $$$\\\\frac{p_i}{100}$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$.Creatnx asks the mirrors one by one, starting from the $$$1$$$-st mirror. Every day, if he asks $$$i$$$-th mirror, there are two possibilities:The $$$i$$$-th mirror tells Creatnx that he is beautiful. In this case, if $$$i = n$$$ Creatnx will stop and become happy, otherwise he will continue asking the $$$i+1$$$-th mirror next day;In the other case, Creatnx will feel upset. The next day, Creatnx will start asking from the $$$1$$$-st mirror again.You need to calculatethe expected numberof days until Creatnx becomes happy.This number should be found by modulo $$$998244353$$$. Formally, let $$$M = 998244353$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\\\not \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\\\cdot q^{-1} \\\\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\\\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\\\cdot q \\\\equiv p \\\\pmod{M}$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of mirrors.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq p_i \\\\leq 100$$$).OutputPrint the answer modulo $$$998244353$$$ in a single line.ExamplesInput1 50Output2Input3 10 20 50Output112NoteIn the first test, there is only one mirror and it tells, that Creatnx is beautiful with probability $$$\\\\frac{1}{2}$$$. So, the expected number of days until Creatnx becomes happy is $$$2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "136d5a2d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ mirrors.
