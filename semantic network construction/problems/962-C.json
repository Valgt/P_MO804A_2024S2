Make a Squaretime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a positive integer $$$n$$$, written without leading zeroes (for example, the number04is incorrect).In one operation you can delete any digit of the given integer so that the result remains a positive integer without leading zeros.Determine the minimum number of operations that you need to consistently apply to the given integer $$$n$$$ to make from it the square of some positive integer or report that it is impossible.An integer $$$x$$$ is the square of some positive integer if and only if $$$x=y^2$$$ for some positive integer $$$y$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^{9}$$$). The number is given without leading zeroes.OutputIf it is impossible to make the square of some positive integer from $$$n$$$, print-1. In the other case, print the minimal number of operations required to do it.ExamplesInput8314Output2Input625Output0Input333Output-1NoteIn the first example we should delete from $$$8314$$$ the digits $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$. After that $$$8314$$$ become equals to $$$81$$$, which is the square of the integer $$$9$$$.In the second example the given $$$625$$$ is the square of the integer $$$25$$$, so you should not delete anything.In the third example it is impossible to make the square from $$$333$$$, so the answer is-1.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6ee39b9e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a positive integer $n$.
