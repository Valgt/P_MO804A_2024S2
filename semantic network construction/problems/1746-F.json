Kazaeetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers and you have to handle $$$q$$$ queries of the following types:$$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$x$$$: change $$$a_{i}$$$ to $$$x$$$,$$$2$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ $$$k$$$: check if the number of occurrences of every positive integer in the subarray $$$a_{l}, a_{l+1}, \\\\ldots a_{r}$$$ is a multiple of $$$k$$$ (check the example for better understanding).InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n , q \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$), the length of $$$a$$$ and the number of queries.Next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, \\\\ldots a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_{i} \\\\le 10^9$$$) â€” the elements of $$$a$$$.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines describes a query.

So the answer is \"NO\".In the third query, requested subarray is $$$[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]$$$, and it can be seen that the number of occurrence of every integer in this sub array is divisible by $$$k = 2$$$. So the answer is \"YES\".In the sixth query, requested subarray is $$$[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3]$$$, and it can be seen that the number of occurrence of every integer in this sub array is divisible by $$$k = 3$$$.
