Squarestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ squares drawn from left to right on the floor. The $$$i$$$-th square has three integers $$$p_i,a_i,b_i$$$, written on it. The sequence $$$p_1,p_2,\\\\dots,p_n$$$ forms a permutation.Each round you will start from the leftmost square $$$1$$$ and jump to the right. If you are now on the $$$i$$$-th square, you can do one of the following two operations:Jump to the $$$i+1$$$-th square and pay the cost $$$a_i$$$. If $$$i=n$$$, then you can end the round and pay the cost $$$a_i$$$.Jump to the $$$j$$$-th square and pay the cost $$$b_i$$$, where $$$j$$$ is the leftmost square that satisfies $$$j > i, p_j > p_i$$$. If there is no such $$$j$$$ then you can end the round and pay the cost $$$b_i$$$.There are $$$q$$$ rounds in the game. To make the game more difficult, you need to maintain a square set $$$S$$$ (initially it is empty). Youmustpass through these squares during the round (other squares can also be passed through). The square set $$$S$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th round is obtained by adding or removing a square from the square set for the $$$(i-1)$$$-th round.For each round find the minimum cost you should pay to end it.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n,q\\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$)  — the number of squares and the number of rounds.The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\\\dots,p_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le p_i\\\\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sequence $$$p_1,p_2,\\\\dots,p_n$$$ forms a permutation.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9\\\\le a_i\\\\le 10^9$$$).The fourth line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1,b_2,\\\\dots,b_n$$$ ($$$-10^9\\\\le b_i\\\\le 10^9$$$).Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, $$$i$$$-th of them contains a single integer $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1\\\\le x_i\\\\le n$$$). If $$$x_i$$$ was in the set $$$S$$$ on the $$$(i-1)$$$-th round you should remove it, otherwise, you should add it.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines, each of them should contain a single integer  — the minimum cost you should pay to end the corresponding round.ExamplesInput3 2 2 1 3 10 -5 4 3 -2 3 1 2Output6 8Input5 4 2 1 5 3 4 6 -5 3 -10 -1 0 3 2 7 2 1 2 3 2Output-8 -7 -7 -8NoteLet's consider the character $$$T$$$ as the end of a round. Then we can draw two graphs for the first and the second test.In the first round of the first test, the set that you must pass through is $$$\\\\{1\\\\}$$$. The path you can use is $$$1\\\\to 3\\\\to T$$$ and its cost is $$$6$$$.In the second round of the first test, the set that you must pass through is $$$\\\\{1,2\\\\}$$$.
