Count the minimum number of stones to take from the table so that any two neighboring stones had different colors. Stones in a row are considered neighboring if there are no other stones between them.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 50)— the number of stones on the table.The next line contains strings, which represents the colors of the stones. We'll consider the stones in the row numbered from1tonfrom left to right.
