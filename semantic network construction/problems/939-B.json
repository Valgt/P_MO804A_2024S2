Hamster Farmtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDima has a hamsters farm. SoonNhamsters will grow up on it and Dima will sell them in a city nearby.Hamsters should be transported in boxes. If some box is not completely full, the hamsters in it are bored, that's why each box should be completely full with hamsters.Dima can buy boxes at a factory. The factory produces boxes ofKkinds, boxes of thei-th kind can contain in themselvesaihamsters. Dima can buy any amount of boxes, but he should buy boxes of only one kind to get a wholesale discount.Of course, Dima would buy boxes in such a way that each box can be completely filled with hamsters and transported to the city. If there is no place for some hamsters, Dima will leave them on the farm.Find out how many boxes and of which type should Dima buy to transport maximum number of hamsters.InputThe first line contains two integersNandK(0 ≤N≤ 1018,1 ≤K≤ 105) — the number of hamsters that will grow up on Dima's farm and the number of types of boxes that the factory produces.The second line containsKintegersa1,a2, ...,aK(1 ≤ai≤ 1018for alli) — the capacities of boxes.OutputOutput two integers: the type of boxes that Dima should buy and the number of boxes of that type Dima should buy.
