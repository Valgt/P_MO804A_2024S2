The vertices of the first part are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the vertices of the second part are numbered from $$$n+1$$$ to $$$2n$$$.Each vertex's degree is $$$2$$$.For a tuple of four integers $$$(l, r, L, R)$$$, where $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$ and $$$n+1 \\\\le L \\\\le R \\\\le 2n$$$, let's define $$$G'(l, r, L, R)$$$ as the graph which consists of all vertices of the given graph that are included in the segment $$$[l, r]$$$ or in the segment $$$[L, R]$$$, and all edges of the given graph such that each of their endpoints belongs to one of these segments. In other words, to obtain $$$G'(l, r, L, R)$$$ from the original graph, you have to remove all vertices $$$i$$$ such that $$$i \\\\notin [l, r]$$$ and $$$i \\\\notin [L, R]$$$, and all edges incident to these vertices.Calculate the sum of $$$\\\\mathit{MM}(G(l, r, L, R))$$$ over all tuples of integers $$$(l, r, L, R)$$$ having $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$ and $$$n+1 \\\\le L \\\\le R \\\\le 2n$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 1500$$$) — the number of vertices in each part.Then $$$2n$$$ lines follow, each denoting an edge of the graph. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i \\\\le n$$$; $$$n + 1 \\\\le y_i \\\\le 2n$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th edge.There are no multiple edges in the given graph, and each vertex hasexactlytwo incident edges.OutputPrint one integer — the sum of $$$\\\\mathit{MM}(G(l, r, L, R))$$$ over all tuples of integers $$$(l, r, L, R)$$$ having $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$ and $$$n+1 \\\\le L \\\\le R \\\\le 2n$$$.ExampleInput5 4 6 4 9 2 6 3 9 1 8 5 10 2 7 3 7 1 10 5 8Output314", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b184a5d7", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a bipartite graph with $n$ vertices in each part.
