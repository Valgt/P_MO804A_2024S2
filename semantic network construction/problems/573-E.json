Bear and Bowlingtime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLimak is an old brown bear. He often goes bowling with his friends. Today he feels really good and tries to beat his own record!For rolling a ball one gets a score — an integer (maybe negative) number of points. Score fori-th roll is multiplied byiand scores are summed up. So, forkrolls with scoress1,s2, ...,sk, total score is. Total score is0if there were no rolls.Limak madenrolls and got scoreaifori-th of them. He wants to maximize his total score and he came up with an interesting idea. He will cancel some rolls, saying that something distracted him or there was a strong wind.Limak is able to cancel any number of rolls, maybe even all or none of them. Total score is calculated as if there were only non-canceled rolls. Look at the sample tests for clarification. What maximum total score can Limak get?InputThe first line contains single integern(1 ≤n≤ 105).The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(|ai| ≤ 107)- scores for Limak's rolls.OutputPrint the maximum possible total score after choosing rolls to cancel.ExamplesInput5-2 -8 0 5 -3Output13Input6-10 20 -30 40 -50 60Output400NoteIn first sample Limak should cancel rolls with scores- 8and- 3. Then he is left with three rolls with scores- 2, 0, 5. Total score is1·( - 2) + 2·0 + 3·5 = 13.In second sample Limak should cancel roll with score- 50.
