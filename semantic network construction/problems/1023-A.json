Single Wildcard Pattern Matchingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$. The string $$$s$$$ consists of lowercase Latin letters andat most onewildcard character '*', the string $$$t$$$ consists only of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string $$$s$$$ equals $$$n$$$, the length of the string $$$t$$$ equals $$$m$$$.The wildcard character '*' in the string $$$s$$$ (if any) can be replaced with an arbitrary sequence (possibly empty) of lowercase Latin letters. No other character of $$$s$$$ can be replaced with anything. If it is possible to replace a wildcard character '*' in $$$s$$$ to obtain a string $$$t$$$, then the string $$$t$$$ matches the pattern $$$s$$$.For example, if $$$s=$$$\"aba*aba\" then the following strings match it \"abaaba\", \"abacaba\" and \"abazzzaba\", but the following strings do not match: \"ababa\", \"abcaaba\", \"codeforces\", \"aba1aba\", \"aba?aba\".If the given string $$$t$$$ matches the given string $$$s$$$, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\".InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the length of the string $$$s$$$ and the length of the string $$$t$$$, respectively.The second line contains string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, which consists of lowercase Latin letters andat most onewildcard character '*'.The third line contains string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m$$$, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.OutputPrint \"YES\" (without quotes), if you can obtain the string $$$t$$$ from the string $$$s$$$.

So the string $$$s$$$ after this replacement is \"codeforces\" and the answer is \"YES\".In the second example a wildcard character '*' can be replaced with an empty string. So the string $$$s$$$ after this replacement is \"vkcup\" and the answer is \"YES\".There is no wildcard character '*' in the third example and the strings \"v\" and \"k\" are different so the answer is \"NO\".In the fourth example there is no such replacement of a wildcard character '*' that you can obtain the string $$$t$$$ so the answer is \"NO\".", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f7f9727c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two strings,  $s$ and $t$. \n\n* String $s$ has lowercase letters and at most one wildcard character '*'.\n* String $t$ has only lowercase letters.\n\nThe wildcard '*' in $s$ can be replaced with any sequence of lowercase letters (including an empty sequence).
