Garbage Disposaltime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEnough is enough. Too many times it happened that Vasya forgot to dispose of garbage and his apartment stank afterwards. Now he wants to create a garbage disposal plan and stick to it.For each of next $$$n$$$ days Vasya knows $$$a_i$$$ — number ofunits of garbagehe will produce on the $$$i$$$-th day. Eachunit of garbagemust be disposed of either on the day it was produced or on the next day. Vasya disposes of garbage by putting it inside a bag and dropping the bag into a garbage container. Each bag can contain up to $$$k$$$units of garbage. It is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags into a garbage container in a single day.Being economical, Vasya wants to use as few bags as possible. You are to compute the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all of his garbage for the given $$$n$$$ days. No garbage should be left after the $$$n$$$-th day.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5, 1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$$$) — number of days to consider and bag's capacity. The second line contains $$$n$$$ space separated integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the number ofunits of garbageproduced on the $$$i$$$-th day.OutputOutput a single integer — the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage. Eachunit of garbageshould be disposed on the day it was produced or on the next day. No garbage can be left after the $$$n$$$-th day. In a day it is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags.ExamplesInput3 23 2 1Output3Input5 11000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000Output5000000000Input3 21 0 1Output2Input4 42 8 4 1Output4", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "95fa4af8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ days and a bag capacity $k$.
