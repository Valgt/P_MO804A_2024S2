Note thateveryonemust be seated in the bus.It is guaranteed that all family members will fit on the bus. Formally, it is guaranteed that $$$\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i \\\\le 2r$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$; $$$1 \\\\le r \\\\le 500$$$) — the number of families and the number of rows in the bus.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10$$$) — the number of family members in each family.OutputFor each test case, output the maximum number of happy people in an optimal seating arrangement.ExampleInput43 32 3 13 32 2 24 51 1 2 24 53 1 1 3Output4 6 6 6NoteIn the first test case, the two members of the first family can sit together in the first row, while the two members of the second family can sit together in the second row.
