Vitaly and Nighttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOne day Vitaly was going home late at night and wondering: how many people aren't sleeping at that moment? To estimate, Vitaly decided to look which windows are lit in the house he was passing by at that moment.Vitaly sees a building ofnfloors and2·mwindows on each floor. On each floor there aremflats numbered from1tom, and two consecutive windows correspond to each flat. If we number the windows from1to2·mfrom left to right, then thej-th flat of thei-th floor has windows2·j- 1and2·jin the corresponding row of windows (as usual, floors are enumerated from the bottom). Vitaly thinks that people in the flat aren't sleeping at that moment ifat least oneof the windows corresponding to this flat has lights on.Given the information about the windows of the given house, your task is to calculate the number of flats where, according to Vitaly, people aren't sleeping.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 100) — the number of floors in the house and the number of flats on each floor respectively.Nextnlines describe the floors from top to bottom and contain2·mcharacters each. If thei-th window of the given floor has lights on, then thei-th character of this line is '1', otherwise it is '0'.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of flats that have lights on in at least one window, that is, the flats where, according to Vitaly, people aren't sleeping.ExamplesInput2 20 0 0 11 0 1 1Output3Input1 31 1 0 1 0 0Output2NoteIn the first test case the house has two floors, two flats on each floor. That is, in total there are 4 flats. The light isn't on only on the second floor in the left flat. That is, in both rooms of the flat the light is off.In the second test case the house has one floor and the first floor has three flats. The light is on in the leftmost flat (in both windows) and in the middle flat (in one window). In the right flat the light is off.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ce97f76d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a building with $n$ floors and $m$ flats on each floor.
