Limak and Shooting Pointstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBearland is a dangerous place. Limak can’t travel on foot. Instead, he haskmagic teleportation stones. Each stone can be usedat most once. Thei-th stone allows to teleport to a point(axi,ayi). Limak can use stonesin any order.There arenmonsters in Bearland. Thei-th of them stands at(mxi,myi).The givenk+npoints are pairwise distinct.After each teleportation, Limak can shoot an arrow in some direction. An arrow will hit the first monster in the chosen direction. Then, both an arrow and a monster disappear. It’s dangerous to stay in one place for long, so Limak can shoot only one arrow from one place.A monster should be afraid if it’s possible that Limak will hit it. How many monsters should be afraid of Limak?InputThe first line of the input contains two integerskandn(1 ≤k≤ 7,1 ≤n≤ 1000) — the number of stones and the number of monsters.Thei-th of followingklines contains two integersaxiandayi(- 109≤axi,ayi≤ 109) — coordinates to which Limak can teleport using thei-th stone.Thei-th of lastnlines contains two integersmxiandmyi(- 109≤mxi,myi≤ 109) — coordinates of thei-th monster.The givenk+npoints are pairwise distinct.OutputPrint the number of monsters which should be afraid of Limak.ExamplesInput2 4-2 -14 54 22 14 -11 -1Output3Input3 810 200 020 40300 60030 60170 34050 10028 5690 180-4 -8-1 -2Output5NoteIn the first sample, there are two stones and four monsters. Stones allow to teleport to points( - 2,  - 1)and(4, 5), marked blue in the drawing below. Monsters are at(4, 2),(2, 1),(4,  - 1)and(1,  - 1), marked red. A monster at(4,  - 1)shouldn't be afraid because it's impossible that Limak will hit it with an arrow. Other three monsters can be hit and thus the answer is3.In the second sample, five monsters should be afraid. Safe monsters are those at(300, 600),(170, 340)and(90, 180).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6c3a3e7e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $k$ points and $n$ points.
