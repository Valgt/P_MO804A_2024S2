The letters in the Latin alphabet are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$26$$$, where the letter \"a\" has the index $$$1$$$, and the letter \"z\" has the index $$$26$$$.He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the alphabet. For example, the word \"cat\" he would encode as the integer $$$3 + 1 + 20 = 24$$$, because the letter \"c\" has the index $$$3$$$ in the alphabet, the letter \"a\" has the index $$$1$$$, and the letter \"t\" has the index $$$20$$$.However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding the word \"ava\", the integer $$$1 + 22 + 1 = 24$$$ is also obtained.Determine the lexicographically smallest word of $$$3$$$ letters that could have been encoded.A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:$$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \\\\ne b$$$;in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases in the test.This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 78$$$) — the encoded word.OutputFor each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded on a separate line.ExampleInput5247035548Outputaav rzz aaa czz auz", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "abe8d9a9", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number, find the smallest 3-letter word that could have produced that number when each letter's position in the alphabet was added together."}, {"prompt_md5": "f3267ab8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 78$).
