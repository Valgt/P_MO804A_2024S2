The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t\\\\leq 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3\\\\leq n\\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output \"Yes\" if array $$$a$$$ is beautiful, and output \"No\" otherwise.You can output \"Yes\" and \"No\" in any case (for example, strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput437 3 857 1 9 3 554 12 2 6 357 49 9 3 1000000000OutputNo Yes Yes NoNoteIn the first test case, any two numbers in the array are coprime, so the answer is \"No\".In the second test case, we can pick $$$i=2$$$ and $$$j=1$$$. Since every number in the array is divisible by $$$a_i = 1$$$, the answer is \"Yes\".In the third test case, we can pick $$$i=3$$$ and $$$j=5$$$. $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ is divisible by $$$a_i = 2$$$ while $$$3$$$, $$$6$$$ and $$$12$$$ is divisible by $$$a_j = 3$$$, so the answer is \"Yes\".", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "924e3d9b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ positive integers.
