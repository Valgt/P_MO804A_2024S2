Playing Around the Tabletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ players, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ sitting around a round table. The $$$(i+1)$$$-th player sits to the right of the $$$i$$$-th player for $$$1 \\\\le i < n$$$, and the $$$1$$$-st player sits to the right of the $$$n$$$-th player.There are $$$n^2$$$ cards, each of which has an integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ written on it. For each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, there are exactly $$$n$$$ cards having this number.Initially, all these cards are distributed among all the players, in such a way that each of them has exactly $$$n$$$ cards. In one operation, each player chooses one of his cards and passes it to the player to his right. All these actions are performedsimultaneously.Player $$$i$$$ is calledsolidif all his cards have the integer $$$i$$$ written on them. Their objective is to reach a configuration in which everyone is solid. Find a way to do it using at most $$$(n^2-n)$$$ operations. You donotneed to minimize the number of operations.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\\\le n\\\\le 100$$$).Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le c_j\\\\le n$$$) — the initial cards of the $$$i$$$-th player.It is guaranteed that for each integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, there are exactly $$$n$$$ cards having the number $$$i$$$.OutputIn the first line print an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\\\le k\\\\le (n^2-n)$$$) — the numbers of operations you want to make.Then $$$k$$$ lines should follow. In the $$$i$$$-th of them print $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\\\ldots, d_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le d_j\\\\le n$$$) where $$$d_j$$$ is the number written on the card which $$$j$$$-th player passes to the player to his right in the $$$i$$$-th operation.We can show that an answer always exists under the given constraints. If there are multiple answers, print any.ExamplesInput2 2 1 1 2Output1 2 1Input3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3Output6 1 2 3 3 1 2 2 3 1 1 2 3 3 1 2 2 3 1NoteIn the first test case, if the first player passes a card with number $$$2$$$ and the second player passes a card with number $$$1$$$, then the first player has two cards with number $$$1$$$ and the second player has two cards with number $$$2$$$. Then, after making this operation, both players are solid.In the second test case, $$$0$$$ operations would be enough too.
