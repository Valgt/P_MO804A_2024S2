Shifts and Sortingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's define acyclic shiftof some string $$$s$$$ as a transformation from $$$s_1 s_2 \\\\dots s_{n-1} s_{n}$$$ into $$$s_{n} s_1 s_2 \\\\dots s_{n-1}$$$. In other words, you take one last character $$$s_n$$$ and place it before the first character while moving all other characters to the right.You are given a binary string $$$s$$$ (a string consisting of only0-s and/or1-s).In one operation, you can choose any substring $$$s_l s_{l+1} \\\\dots s_r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l < r \\\\le |s|$$$) and cyclically shift it. Thecostof such operation is equal to $$$r - l + 1$$$ (or the length of the chosen substring).You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimumtotalcost to make $$$s$$$ sorted in non-descending order?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$s_i \\\\in$$$ {0,1}) — the string you need to sort.Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make string sorted using operation above any number of times.ExampleInput51000001100010101101101001Output2 0 9 5 11NoteIn the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic shift:10$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$01. The length of the substring is $$$2$$$, so the cost is $$$2$$$.In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to perform any operations.In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:choose substring $$$[1, 3]$$$:11000$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$01100;choose substring $$$[2, 4]$$$:01100$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$00110;choose substring $$$[3, 5]$$$:00110$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$00011.The total cost is $$$3 + 3 + 3 = 9$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "03445391", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a binary string (a string consisting of only 0s and 1s).
