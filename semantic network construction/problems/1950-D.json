Product of Binary Decimalstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call a number abinary decimalif it is a positive integer and all digits in its decimal notation are either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. For example, $$$1\\\\,010\\\\,111$$$ is a binary decimal, while $$$10\\\\,201$$$ and $$$787\\\\,788$$$ are not.Given a number $$$n$$$, you are asked whether or not it is possible to represent $$$n$$$ as a product of some (not necessarily distinct) binary decimals.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 5 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if $$$n$$$ can be represented as a product of binary decimals, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.You can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yES\", \"yes\", and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput111211146411222110110100000991122024124211001OutputYES YES YES YES YES YES NO NO NO NO YESNoteThe first five test cases can be represented as a product of binary decimals as follows:$$$121 = 11 \\\\times 11$$$.$$$1 = 1$$$ is already a binary decimal.$$$14\\\\,641 = 11 \\\\times 11 \\\\times 11 \\\\times 11$$$.$$$12\\\\,221 = 11 \\\\times 11 \\\\times 101$$$.$$$10\\\\,110 = 10\\\\,110$$$ is already a binary decimal.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2e57b7e4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a number $n$.
