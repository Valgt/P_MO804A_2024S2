Boboniu and Banknote Collectiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNo matter what trouble you're in, don't be afraid, but face it with a smile.I've made another billion dollars!â€” BoboniuBoboniu has issued his currencies, named Bobo Yuan. Bobo Yuan (BBY) is a series of currencies. Boboniu gives each of them a positive integer identifier, such as BBY-1, BBY-2, etc.Boboniu has a BBY collection. His collection looks like a sequence. For example:We can use sequence $$$a=[1,2,3,3,2,1,4,4,1]$$$ of length $$$n=9$$$ to denote it.Now Boboniu wants tofoldhis collection. You can imagine that Boboniu stick his collection to a long piece of paper and fold it between currencies:Boboniu will only fold the same identifier of currencies together. In other words, if $$$a_i$$$ is folded over $$$a_j$$$ ($$$1\\\\le i,j\\\\le n$$$), then $$$a_i=a_j$$$ must hold. Boboniu doesn't care if you follow this rule in the process of folding. But once it is finished, the rule should be obeyed.A formal definition offoldis described in notes.According to the picture above, you canfold$$$a$$$ two times. In fact, you canfold$$$a=[1,2,3,3,2,1,4,4,1]$$$ at most two times. So the maximum number of folds of it is $$$2$$$.As an international fan of Boboniu, you're asked to calculate the maximum number of folds.You're given a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\\\le i\\\\le n$$$), you need to calculate the maximum number of folds of $$$[a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_i]$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le a_i\\\\le n$$$).OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th of them should be equal to the maximum number of folds of $$$[a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_i]$$$.ExamplesInput9 1 2 3 3 2 1 4 4 1Output0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2Input9 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 2Output0 0 1 2 3 3 4 4 5Input15 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 2 3 4 4 3 6Output0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 0Input50 1 2 4 6 6 4 2 1 3 5 5 3 1 2 4 4 2 1 3 3 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 4 6 6 4 2 1 3 5 5 3 1 2 4 4 2 1 3 3 1 2 2 1 1Output0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 6 7 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 7 7 8NoteFormally, for a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, let's define thefolding sequenceas a sequence $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that:$$$b_i$$$ ($$$1\\\\le i\\\\le n$$$) is either $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$.Let $$$p(i)=[b_i=1]+\\\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}b_j$$$.
