Bonus Distributiontime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor the first time, Polycarp's startup ended the year with a profit! Now he is about to distribute $$$k$$$ burles as a bonus among $$$n$$$ employees.It is known that the current salary of the $$$i$$$-th employee is $$$a_i$$$ and all the values of $$$a_i$$$ in the company aredifferent.Polycarp wants to distribute the $$$k$$$ burles between $$$n$$$ employees so this month the $$$i$$$-th employee will be paid not $$$a_i$$$, but $$$a_i+d_i$$$ ($$$d_i \\\\ge 0$$$, $$$d_i$$$ is an integer), where $$$d_i$$$ is the bonus for the $$$i$$$-th employee. Of course, $$$d_1+d_2+\\\\dots+d_n=k$$$.Polycarp will follow two rules for choosing the values $$$d_i$$$:the relative order of the salaries should not be changed: the employee with originally the highest salary ($$$a_i$$$ is the maximum) should have the highest total payment after receiving their bonus ($$$a_i+d_i$$$ is also the maximum), the employee whose salary was originally the second-largest should receive the second-largest total payment after receiving their bonus and so on.to emphasize that annual profit is a group effort, Polycarp wants tominimizethe maximum total payment to an employee (i.e minimize the maximum value of $$$a_i+d_i$$$).Help Polycarp decide the non-negative integer bonuses $$$d_i$$$ such that:their sum is $$$k$$$,for each employee, the number of those who receivestrictly morethan them remains unchanged (that is, if you sort employees by $$$a_i$$$ and by $$$a_i+d_i$$$, you get the same order of employees),all $$$a_i + d_i$$$ are different,the maximum of the values $$$a_i+d_i$$$ is the minimum possible.Help Polycarp and print any of the possible answers $$$d_1, d_2, \\\\dots, d_n$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the number of employees and the total bonus.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$differentintegers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the current salary of the $$$i$$$-th employee.It is guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ values in the input does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputPrint the answers to $$$t$$$ test cases in the order they appear in the input. Print each answer as a sequence of non-negative integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\\\dots, d_n$$$. If there are several answers, print any of them.ExampleInput5 4 1 3 1 4 2 2 3 10 2 4 1000000000 987654321 1000000000 999999999 500000000 8 9 5 6 1 8 3 4 2 7 6 1 6 3 1 8 5 9Output0 0 1 0  0 3  134259259 121913582 121913582 621913577  2 2 0 2 0 1 0 2  1 0 0 0 0 0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f36085ff", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ different positive integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ representing the salaries of $n$ employees.
