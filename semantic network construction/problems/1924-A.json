Did We Get Everything Covered?time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ along with a string $$$s$$$.Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length $$$n$$$ that can be formed using the first $$$k$$$ lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of $$$s$$$. If the answer isNO, you also need to print a string of length $$$n$$$ that can be formed using the first $$$k$$$ lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of $$$s$$$.If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.Note:A string $$$a$$$ is called a subsequence of another string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from $$$b$$$ without changing the order of the remaining characters.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t \\\\, (1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5)$$$, the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains $$$3$$$ integers $$$n \\\\, (1 \\\\le n \\\\le 26), \\\\: k \\\\, (1 \\\\le k \\\\le 26), \\\\: m \\\\, (1 \\\\le m \\\\le 1000)$$$, where $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ are the same as described in the input and $$$m$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ of length $$$m$$$, comprising only of the first $$$k$$$ lowercase English alphabets.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ and the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, printYESif all possible strings of length $$$n$$$ that can be formed using the first $$$k$$$ lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of $$$s$$$, else printNO.If your answer isNO, print a string of length $$$n$$$ that can be formed using the first $$$k$$$ lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of $$$s$$$ in the next line.You may print each letter ofYESorNOin any case (for example,YES,yES,YeSwill all be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput32 2 4abba2 2 3abb3 3 10aabbccababOutputYES NO aa NO cccNoteFor the first test case, all possible strings (aa,ab,ba,bb) of length $$$2$$$ that can be formed using the first $$$2$$$ English alphabets occur as a subsequence ofabba.For the second test case, the stringaais not a subsequence ofabb.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8f96050a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$, an integer $k$, and a string $s$.
