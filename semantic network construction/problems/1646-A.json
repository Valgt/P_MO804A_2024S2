Square Countingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLuis has a sequence of $$$n+1$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{n+1}$$$. For each $$$i = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, n+1$$$ it is guaranteed that $$$0\\\\leq a_i < n$$$, or $$$a_i=n^2$$$. He has calculated the sum of all the elements of the sequence, and called this value $$$s$$$.Luis has lost his sequence, but he remembers the values of $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$. Can you find the number of elements in the sequence that are equal to $$$n^2$$$?We can show that the answer is unique under the given constraints.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n< 10^6$$$, $$$0\\\\le s \\\\le 10^{18}$$$). It is guaranteed that the value of $$$s$$$ is a valid sum for some sequence satisfying the above constraints.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the number of elements in the sequence which are equal to $$$n^2$$$.ExampleInput47 01 12 123 12Output0 1 3 1NoteIn the first test case, we have $$$s=0$$$ so all numbers are equal to $$$0$$$ and there isn't any number equal to $$$49$$$.In the second test case, we have $$$s=1$$$. There are two possible sequences: $$$[0, 1]$$$ or $$$[1, 0]$$$. In both cases, the number $$$1$$$ appears just once.In the third test case, we have $$$s=12$$$, which is the maximum possible value of $$$s$$$ for this case. Thus, the number $$$4$$$ appears $$$3$$$ times in the sequence.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1f94da13", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$ and a sum $s$.
