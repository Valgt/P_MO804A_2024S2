Enemy is weaktime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe Romans have attacked again. This time they are much more than the Persians but Shapur is ready to defeat them. He says: \"A lion is never afraid of a hundred sheep\".Nevertheless Shapur has to find weaknesses in the Roman army to defeat them. So he gives the army a weakness number.In Shapur's opinion the weakness of an army is equal to the number of tripletsi,j,ksuch thati<j<kandai>aj>akwhereaxis the power of man standing at positionx. The Roman army has one special trait — powers of all the people in it are distinct.Help Shapur find out how weak the Romans are.InputThe first line of input contains a single numbern(3 ≤n≤ 106) — the number of men in Roman army. Next line containsndifferent positive integersai(1 ≤i≤n, 1 ≤ai≤ 109) — powers of men in the Roman army.OutputA single integer number, the weakness of the Roman army.Please, do not use%lldspecificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.
