Problem About Equationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutA group ofnmerry programmers celebrate Robert Floyd's birthday. Polucarpus has got an honourable task of pouring Ber-Cola to everybody. Pouring the same amount of Ber-Cola to everybody is really important. In other words, the drink's volume in each of thenmugs must be the same.Polycarpus has already began the process and he partially emptied the Ber-Cola bottle. Now the first mug hasa1milliliters of the drink, the second one hasa2milliliters and so on. The bottle hasbmilliliters left and Polycarpus plans to pour them into the mugs so that the main equation was fulfilled.Write a program that would determine what volume of the drink Polycarpus needs to add into each mug to ensure that the following two conditions were fulfilled simultaneously:there werebmilliliters poured in total. That is, the bottle need to be emptied;after the process is over, the volumes of the drink in the mugs should be equal.InputThe first line contains a pair of integersn,b(2 ≤n≤ 100, 1 ≤b≤ 100), wherenis the total number of friends in the group andbis the current volume of drink in the bottle. The second line contains a sequence of integersa1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤ 100), whereaiis the current volume of drink in thei-th mug.OutputPrint a single number \"-1\" (without the quotes), if there is no solution. Otherwise, printnfloat numbersc1,c2, ...,cn, whereciis the volume of the drink to add in thei-th mug. Print the numbers with no less than 6 digits after the decimal point, print eachcion a single line. Polycarpus proved that if a solution exists then it is unique.Russian locale is installed by default on the testing computer. Make sure that your solution use the point to separate the integer part of a real number from the decimal, not a comma.ExamplesInput5 501 2 3 4 5Output12.00000011.00000010.0000009.0000008.000000Input2 21 100Output-1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e0f83a0d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ mugs and a bottle of drink.
