Sum of Progressiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ numbers. There are also $$$q$$$ queries of the form $$$s, d, k$$$.For each query $$$q$$$, find the sum of elements $$$a_s + a_{s+d} \\\\cdot 2 + \\\\dots + a_{s + d \\\\cdot (k - 1)} \\\\cdot k$$$. In other words, for each query, it is necessary to find the sum of $$$k$$$ elements of the array with indices starting from the $$$s$$$-th, taking steps of size $$$d$$$, multiplying it by the serial number of the element in the resulting sequence.InputEach test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. Next lines contain descriptions of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains two numbers $$$n, q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5, 1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, ... a_n$$$ ($$$-10^8 \\\\le a_1, ..., a_n \\\\le 10^8$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.The next $$$q$$$ lines each contain three integers $$$s$$$, $$$d$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le s, d, k \\\\le n$$$, $$$s + d\\\\cdot (k - 1) \\\\le n$$$ ).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, and that the sum of $$$q$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5 $$$.OutputFor each testcase, print $$$q$$$ numbers in a separate line — the desired sums, separated with space.ExampleInput53 31 1 21 2 22 2 11 1 23 1-100000000 -100000000 -1000000001 1 35 31 2 3 4 51 2 32 3 21 1 53 1100000000 100000000 1000000001 1 37 734 87 5 42 -44 66 -322 2 24 3 11 3 26 2 15 2 22 5 26 1 2Output5 1 3  -600000000  22 12 55  600000000  171 42 118 66 -108 23 2", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "34ab0351", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ numbers.
