Photo to Remembertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOne daynfriends met at a party, they hadn't seen each other for a long time and so they decided to make a group photo together.Simply speaking, the process of taking photos can be described as follows. On the photo, each photographed friend occupies a rectangle of pixels: thei-th of them occupies the rectangle of widthwipixels and heighthipixels. On the group photo everybody stands in a line, thus the minimum pixel size of the photo including all the photographed friends, isW×H, whereWis the total sum of all widths andHis the maximum height of all the photographed friends.As is usually the case, the friends madenphotos — thej-th (1 ≤j≤n) photo had everybody except for thej-th friend as he was the photographer.Print the minimum size of each made photo in pixels.InputThe first line contains integern(2 ≤n≤ 200 000) — the number of friends.Thennlines follow: thei-th line contains information about thei-th friend. The line contains a pair of integerswi,hi(1 ≤wi≤ 10, 1 ≤hi≤ 1000) — the width and height in pixels of the corresponding rectangle.OutputPrintnspace-separated numbersb1,b2, ...,bn, wherebi— the total number of pixels on the minimum photo containing all friends expect for thei-th one.ExamplesInput31 105 510 1Output75 110 60Input32 11 22 1Output6 4 6", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b1e23514", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ friends taking photos.
