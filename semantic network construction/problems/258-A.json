Little Elephant and Bitstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe Little Elephant has an integera, written in the binary notation. He wants to write this number on a piece of paper.To make sure that the numberafits on the piece of paper, the Little Elephantoughtto delete exactly one any digit from numberain the binary record. At that a new number appears. It consists of the remaining binary digits, written in the corresponding order (possible, with leading zeroes).The Little Elephant wants the number he is going to write on the paper to be as large as possible. Help him find the maximum number that he can obtain after deleting exactly one binary digit and print it in the binary notation.InputThe single line contains integera, written in the binary notation without leading zeroes. This number contains more than1and at most105digits.OutputIn the single line print the number that is written without leading zeroes in the binary notation — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput101Output11Input110010Output11010NoteIn the first sample the best strategy is to delete the second digit.
