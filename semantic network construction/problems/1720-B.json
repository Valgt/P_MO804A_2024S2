Interesting Sumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ that contains $$$n$$$ integers. You can choose any proper subsegment $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\\\ldots, a_r$$$ of this array, meaning you can choose any two integers $$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$, where $$$r - l + 1 < n$$$. We define thebeautyof a given subsegment as the value of the following expression:$$$$$$\\\\max(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\\\ldots, a_{l-1}, a_{r+1}, a_{r+2}, \\\\ldots, a_{n}) - \\\\min(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\\\ldots, a_{l-1}, a_{r+1}, a_{r+2}, \\\\ldots, a_{n}) + \\\\max(a_{l}, \\\\ldots, a_{r}) - \\\\min(a_{l}, \\\\ldots, a_{r}).$$$$$$Please find the maximum beauty among all proper subsegments.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of each test case.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(4 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5)$$$ — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_{i} \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the given array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase print a single integer — the maximum beauty of a proper subsegment.ExampleInput4 8 1 2 2 3 1 5 6 1 5 1 2 3 100 200 4 3 3 3 3 6 7 8 3 1 1 8Output9 297 0 14NoteIn the first test case, the optimal segment is $$$l = 7$$$, $$$r = 8$$$. The beauty of this segment equals to $$$(6 - 1) + (5 - 1) = 9$$$.In the second test case, the optimal segment is $$$l = 2$$$, $$$r = 4$$$. The beauty of this segment equals $$$(100 - 2) + (200 - 1) = 297$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c624505e", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers.
