Jumpstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are standing on the $$$\\\\mathit{OX}$$$-axis at point $$$0$$$ and you want to move to an integer point $$$x > 0$$$.You can make several jumps. Suppose you're currently at point $$$y$$$ ($$$y$$$ may be negative) and jump for the $$$k$$$-th time. You can:either jump to the point $$$y + k$$$or jump to the point $$$y - 1$$$.What is the minimum number of jumps you need to reach the point $$$x$$$?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains the single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the destination point.OutputFor each test case, print the single integer — the minimum number of jumps to reach $$$x$$$. It can be proved that we can reach any integer point $$$x$$$.ExampleInput5 1 2 3 4 5Output1 3 2 3 4NoteIn the first test case $$$x = 1$$$, so you need only one jump: the $$$1$$$-st jump from $$$0$$$ to $$$0 + 1 = 1$$$.In the second test case $$$x = 2$$$. You need at least three jumps:the $$$1$$$-st jump from $$$0$$$ to $$$0 + 1 = 1$$$;the $$$2$$$-nd jump from $$$1$$$ to $$$1 + 2 = 3$$$;the $$$3$$$-rd jump from $$$3$$$ to $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$;Two jumps are not enough because these are the only possible variants:the $$$1$$$-st jump as $$$-1$$$ and the $$$2$$$-nd one as $$$-1$$$ — you'll reach $$$0 -1 -1 =-2$$$;the $$$1$$$-st jump as $$$-1$$$ and the $$$2$$$-nd one as $$$+2$$$ — you'll reach $$$0 -1 +2 = 1$$$;the $$$1$$$-st jump as $$$+1$$$ and the $$$2$$$-nd one as $$$-1$$$ — you'll reach $$$0 +1 -1 = 0$$$;the $$$1$$$-st jump as $$$+1$$$ and the $$$2$$$-nd one as $$$+2$$$ — you'll reach $$$0 +1 +2 = 3$$$;In the third test case, you need two jumps: the $$$1$$$-st one as $$$+1$$$ and the $$$2$$$-nd one as $$$+2$$$, so $$$0 + 1 + 2 = 3$$$.In the fourth test case, you need three jumps: the $$$1$$$-st one as $$$-1$$$, the $$$2$$$-nd one as $$$+2$$$ and the $$$3$$$-rd one as $$$+3$$$, so $$$0 - 1 + 2 + 3 = 4$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b2cbc0a9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You start at position 0 on a number line.
