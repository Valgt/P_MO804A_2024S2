Hongcow Draws a Circletime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputHongcow really likes the color red. Hongcow doesn't like the color blue.Hongcow is standing in an infinite field where there arenred points andmblue points.Hongcow wants to draw a circle in the field such that this circle contains at least one red point, and no blue points. Points that line exactly on the boundary of the circle can be counted as either inside or outside.Compute the radius of the largest circle that satisfies this condition. If this circle can have arbitrarily large size, print- 1. Otherwise, your answer will be accepted if it has relative or absolute error at most10- 4.InputThe first line of the input will contain two integersn,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 1, 000).The nextnlines will contain two integersxi,yi(1 ≤xi,yi≤ 104). This denotes the coordinates of a red point.The nextmlines will contain two integersxi,yi(1 ≤xi,yi≤ 104). This denotes the coordinates of a blue point.No two points will have the same coordinates.OutputPrint- 1if the circle can have arbitrary size. Otherwise, print a floating point number representing the largest radius circle that satisfies the conditions. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed10- 4.Namely, let's assume that your answer isaand the answer of the jury isb. The checker program will consider your answer correct if.ExamplesInput2 52 33 41 11 44 24 72 5Output3.5355338827Input1 63 31 55 42 13 44 21 3Output1.5811388195Input2 22 23 31 14 4Output-1NoteThis is a picture of the first sampleThis is a picture of the second sample", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "07f49183", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of red points and a set of blue points in a 2D plane.
