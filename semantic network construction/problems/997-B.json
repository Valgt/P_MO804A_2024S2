Roman Digitstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's introduce a number system which is based on a roman digits. There are digitsI,V,X,Lwhich correspond to the numbers $$$1$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$10$$$ and $$$50$$$ respectively. The use of other roman digits is not allowed.Numbers in this system are written as a sequence of one or more digits. We define the value of the sequence simply as the sum of digits in it.For example, the numberXXXVevaluates to $$$35$$$ and the numberIXI— to $$$12$$$.Pay attention to the difference to the traditional roman system — in our system any sequence of digits is valid, moreover the order of digits doesn't matter, for exampleIXmeans $$$11$$$, not $$$9$$$.One can notice that this system is ambiguous, and some numbers can be written in many different ways. Your goal is to determine how many distinct integers can be represented byexactly$$$n$$$ roman digitsI,V,X,L.InputThe only line of the input file contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the number of roman digits to use.OutputOutput a single integer — the number of distinct integers which can be represented using $$$n$$$ roman digitsexactly.ExamplesInput1Output4Input2Output10Input10Output244NoteIn the first sample there are exactly $$$4$$$ integers which can be represented —I,V,XandL.In the second sample it is possible to represent integers $$$2$$$ (II), $$$6$$$ (VI), $$$10$$$ (VV), $$$11$$$ (XI), $$$15$$$ (XV), $$$20$$$ (XX), $$$51$$$ (IL), $$$55$$$ (VL), $$$60$$$ (XL) and $$$100$$$ (LL).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2d4dc580", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a number $n$.
