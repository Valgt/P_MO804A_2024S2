He learned recently that programmers do not code every bit of their apps from scratch.For example they never write a code to sum two integers, because their languages have the ability to do the sum. But can they use it? Can an experienced coder who has attended more than 100 contests, sum two integers?Bijan is not sure about this. What's your opinion?InputYou are given two integersaandb, one per line (1 ≤a,b< 10500).
