Prove Him Wrongtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecently, your friend discovered one special operation on an integer array $$$a$$$:Choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \\\\neq j$$$);Set $$$a_i = a_j = |a_i - a_j|$$$.After playing with this operation for a while, he came to the next conclusion:For every array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, where $$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$, you can find a pair of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that the total sum of $$$a$$$ willdecreaseafter performing the operation.This statement sounds fishy to you, so you want to find a counterexample for a given integer $$$n$$$. Can you find such counterexample and prove him wrong?In other words, find an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) such that for all pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ performing the operation won't decrease the total sum (it will increase or not change the sum).InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, if there is no counterexample array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$, printNO.Otherwise, printYESfollowed by the array $$$a$$$ itself ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$). If there are multiple counterexamples, print any.ExampleInput325123OutputYES 1 337 NO YES 31 4 159NoteIn the first test case, the only possible pairs of indices are $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 1)$$$.If you perform the operation on indices $$$(1, 2)$$$ (or $$$(2, 1)$$$), you'll get $$$a_1 = a_2 = |1 - 337| = 336$$$, or array $$$[336, 336]$$$. In both cases, the total sum increases, so this array $$$a$$$ is a counterexample.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "507415fa", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$.
