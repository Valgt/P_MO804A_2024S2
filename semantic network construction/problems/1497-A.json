Meximizationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer $$$n$$$ and an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$. You should reorder the elements of the array $$$a$$$ in such way that the sum of $$$\\\\textbf{MEX}$$$ on prefixes ($$$i$$$-th prefix is $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_i$$$) is maximized.Formally, you should find an array $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n$$$, such that the sets of elements of arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are equal (it is equivalent to array $$$b$$$ can be found as an array $$$a$$$ with some reordering of its elements) and $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\\\textbf{MEX}(b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_i)$$$ is maximized.$$$\\\\textbf{MEX}$$$ of a set of nonnegative integers is the minimal nonnegative integer such that it is not in the set.For example, $$$\\\\textbf{MEX}(\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}) = 0$$$, $$$\\\\textbf{MEX}(\\\\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5\\\\}) = 3$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100)$$$  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100)$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 100)$$$.OutputFor each test case print an array $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n$$$  — the optimal reordering of $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$, so the sum of $$$\\\\textbf{MEX}$$$ on its prefixes is maximized.If there exist multiple optimal answers you can find any.ExampleInput3 7 4 2 0 1 3 3 7 5 2 2 8 6 9 1 0Output0 1 2 3 4 7 3  2 6 8 9 2  0NoteIn the first test case in the answer $$$\\\\textbf{MEX}$$$ for prefixes will be:$$$\\\\textbf{MEX}(\\\\{0\\\\}) = 1$$$$$$\\\\textbf{MEX}(\\\\{0, 1\\\\}) = 2$$$$$$\\\\textbf{MEX}(\\\\{0, 1, 2\\\\}) = 3$$$$$$\\\\textbf{MEX}(\\\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\\\}) = 4$$$$$$\\\\textbf{MEX}(\\\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\\\}) = 5$$$$$$\\\\textbf{MEX}(\\\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7\\\\}) = 5$$$$$$\\\\textbf{MEX}(\\\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 3\\\\}) = 5$$$The sum of $$$\\\\textbf{MEX} = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25$$$.
