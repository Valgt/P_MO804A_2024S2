Megacitytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe administration of the Tomsk Region firmly believes that it's time to become a megacity (that is, get population of one million). Instead of improving the demographic situation, they decided to achieve its goal by expanding the boundaries of the city.The city of Tomsk can be represented as point on the plane with coordinates (0;0). The city is surrounded withnother locations, thei-th one has coordinates (xi,yi) with the population ofkipeople. You can widen the city boundaries to a circle of radiusr. In such case all locations inside the circle and on its border are included into the city.Your goal is to write a program that will determine the minimum radiusr, to which is necessary to expand the boundaries of Tomsk, so that it becomes a megacity.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnands(1 ≤n≤ 103;1 ≤s< 106) — the number of locatons around Tomsk city and the population of the city. Thennlines follow. Thei-th line contains three integers — thexiandyicoordinate values of thei-th location and the numberkiof people in it (1 ≤ki< 106). Each coordinate is an integer and doesn't exceed104in its absolute value.It is guaranteed that no two locations are at the same point and no location is at point (0; 0).OutputIn the output, print \"-1\" (without the quotes), if Tomsk won't be able to become a megacity. Otherwise, in the first line print a single real number — the minimum radius of the circle that the city needs to expand to in order to become a megacity.The answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error don't exceed10- 6.ExamplesInput4 9999981 1 12 2 13 3 12 -2 1Output2.8284271Input4 9999981 1 22 2 13 3 12 -2 1Output1.4142136Input2 11 1 9999972 2 1Output-1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5df44cda", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a city located at the origin (0, 0) and a number of other locations with their coordinates and populations.
