Asya And Kittenstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAsya loves animals very much. Recently, she purchased $$$n$$$ kittens, enumerated them from $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ and then put them into the cage. The cage consists of one row of $$$n$$$ cells, enumerated with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. Adjacent cells had a partially transparent partition wall between them, hence there were $$$n - 1$$$ partitions originally. Initially, each cell contained exactly one kitten with some number.Observing the kittens, Asya noticed, that they are very friendly and often a pair of kittens in neighboring cells wants to play together. So Asya started to remove partitions between neighboring cells. In particular, on the day $$$i$$$, Asya:Noticed, that the kittens $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$, located in neighboring cells want to play together.Removed the partition between these two cells, efficiently creating a single cell, having all kittens from two original cells.Since Asya has never putted partitions back, after $$$n - 1$$$ days the cage contained a single cell, having all kittens.For every day, Asya remembers numbers of kittens $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$, who wanted to play together, however she doesn't remember how she placed kittens in the cage in the beginning. Please help her and find any possible initial arrangement of the kittens into $$$n$$$ cells.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 150\\\\,000$$$) — the number of kittens.Each of the following $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$x_i \\\\ne y_i$$$) — indices of kittens, which got together due to the border removal on the corresponding day.It's guaranteed, that the kittens $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ were in the different cells before this day.OutputFor every cell from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ print a single integer — the index of the kitten from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, who was originally in it.All printed integers must be distinct.It's guaranteed, that there is at least one answer possible. In case there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.ExampleInput5 1 4 2 5 3 1 4 5Output3 1 4 2 5NoteThe answer for the example contains one of several possible initial arrangements of the kittens.The picture below shows how the cells were united for this initial arrangement. Note, that the kittens who wanted to play together on each day were indeed inadjacent cells.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c973e8ad", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of pairs of numbers, where each pair represents two kittens that wanted to play together and were in adjacent cells.  \n\nThe goal is to determine one possible arrangement of the kittens in the cells at the beginning. \n\n* There are $n$ kittens, numbered from 1 to $n$.\n* Initially, the kittens were in $n$ separate cells.\n* Each day, a pair of kittens in adjacent cells were allowed to play together, and their cells were merged into one.\n* You are given a list of $n-1$ pairs, where each pair $(x_i, y_i)$ represents the kittens that merged on a specific day.\n\nYou need to output a list of $n$ numbers, where each number represents the kitten that was originally in a specific cell. \n\n**Example:**\n\nInput:\n\n```\n5\n1 4\n2 5\n3 1\n4 5\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n3 1 4 2 5\n```\n\n\n\nThis means that initially, kitten 3 was in cell 1, kitten 1 was in cell 2, kitten 4 was in cell 3, kitten 2 was in cell 4, and kitten 5 was in cell 5."}, {"prompt_md5": "189a6137", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of pairs of numbers.
