Bertown roadstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutBertown hasnjunctions andmbidirectional roads. We know that one can get from any junction to any other one by the existing roads.As there were more and more cars in the city, traffic jams started to pose real problems. To deal with them the government decided to make the traffic one-directional on all the roads, thus easing down the traffic. Your task is to determine whether there is a way to make the traffic one-directional so that there still is the possibility to get from any junction to any other one. If the answer is positive, you should also find one of the possible ways to orient the roads.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandm(2 ≤n≤ 105,n- 1 ≤m≤ 3·105) which represent the number of junctions and the roads in the town correspondingly. Then followmlines, each containing two numbers which describe the roads in the city. Each road is determined by two integersaiandbi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi) — the numbers of junctions it connects.It is guaranteed that one can get from any junction to any other one along the existing bidirectional roads. Each road connects different junctions, there is no more than one road between each pair of junctions.OutputIf there's no solution, print the single number0. Otherwise, printmlines each containing two integerspiandqi— each road's orientation. That is the traffic flow will move along a one-directional road from junctionpito junctionqi. You can print the roads in any order. If there are several solutions to that problem, print any of them.ExamplesInput6 81 22 31 34 54 65 62 43 5Output1 22 33 14 55 66 44 23 5Input6 71 22 31 34 54 65 62 4Output0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "19f7bb39", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a town with $n$ junctions and $m$ bidirectional roads connecting them.
