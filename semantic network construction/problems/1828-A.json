Please find an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ that is perfect.A perfect array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ satisfies the following criteria:$$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 1000$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$.$$$a_i$$$ is divisible by $$$i$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$.$$$a_1 + a_2 + \\\\ldots + a_n$$$ is divisible by $$$n$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 200$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 200$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, output an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ that is perfect.We can show that an answer always exists.
