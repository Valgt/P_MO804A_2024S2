Two 0-1 Sequencestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAquaMoon has two binary sequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, which contain only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. AquaMoon can perform the following two operations any number of times ($$$a_1$$$ is the first element of $$$a$$$, $$$a_2$$$ is the second element of $$$a$$$, and so on):Operation 1: if $$$a$$$ contains at least two elements, change $$$a_2$$$ to $$$\\\\operatorname{min}(a_1,a_2)$$$, and remove the first element of $$$a$$$.Operation 2: if $$$a$$$ contains at least two elements, change $$$a_2$$$ to $$$\\\\operatorname{max}(a_1,a_2)$$$, and remove the first element of $$$a$$$.Note that after a removal of the first element of $$$a$$$, the former $$$a_2$$$ becomes the first element of $$$a$$$, the former $$$a_3$$$ becomes the second element of $$$a$$$ and so on, and the length of $$$a$$$ reduces by one.Determine if AquaMoon can make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$ by using these operations.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 2\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n,m \\\\leq 50$$$, $$$m \\\\leq n$$$) — the lengths of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ respectively.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.The third line of each test case contains a string $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$, consisting only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" if AquaMoon can change $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ by using these options; otherwise, output \"NO\".You may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput106 2001001116 2110111016 2000001116 2111111018 510000101110107 4101000110018 6010100100100108 40101010110018 41010101001107 5101110011100OutputYES YES NO NO NO YES YES NO NO YESNoteIn the first test case, you can useOperation 2four times to make $$$a$$$ equals to $$$b$$$.In the second test case, you can useOperation 1four times to make $$$a$$$ equals to $$$b$$$.In the third test case, it can be proved that no matter how we use the operations, it is impossible to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.In the fourth test case, it can be proved that no matter how we use the operations, it is impossible to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.In the fifth test case, you can useOperation 2three times to make $$$a$$$ become $$$10101$$$, so the first element of $$$a$$$ equals to the first element of $$$b$$$, but it can be proved that no matter how to operate, the second to the fifth elements of $$$a$$$ can't be the same as $$$b$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "17037226", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two binary sequences,  $a$ and $b$, of lengths $n$ and $m$ respectively ($m \\leq n$).
