Codeforces Scoreboardtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are participating in a Codeforces Round with $$$n$$$ problems.You spend exactly one minute to solve each problem, the time it takes to submit a problem can be ignored. You can only solve at most one problem at any time. The contest starts at time $$$0$$$, so you can make your first submission at any time $$$t \\\\ge 1$$$ minutes. Whenever you submit a problem, it is always accepted.The scoring of the $$$i$$$-th problem can be represented by three integers $$$k_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, and $$$a_i$$$. If you solve it at time $$$t$$$ minutes, you get $$$\\\\max(b_i - k_i \\\\cdot t,a_i)$$$ points.Your task is to choose an order to solve all these $$$n$$$ problems to get the maximum possible score. You can assume the contest is long enough to solve all problems.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of problems.The $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains three integers $$$k_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1\\\\le k_i,b_i,a_i\\\\le 10^9$$$; $$$a_i < b_i$$$), denoting that you get the score of $$$\\\\max(b_i - k_i \\\\cdot t,a_i)$$$ if you solve the $$$i$$$-th task at time $$$t$$$ minutes.It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a line containing a single integer — the maximum score you can get.ExampleInput4410000 1000000000 200610000 1000000000 99992 999991010 10101000000000 1000000000 99999999961 8 19 29 42 14 34 13 12 19 510 12 584 10 14 19 81 14 34 15 62 9 61 11 102 19 124 19 14105 12 75 39 122 39 113 23 155 30 113 17 135 29 143 17 113 36 183 9 8Output3999961003 53 78 180NoteIn the second test case, the points for all problems at each minute are listed below.Time$$$1$$$$$$2$$$$$$3$$$$$$4$$$$$$5$$$$$$6$$$Problem $$$1$$$$$$7$$$$$$6$$$$$$5$$$$$$\\\\color{red}{4}$$$$$$3$$$$$$2$$$Problem $$$2$$$$$$\\\\color{red}{20}$$$$$$11$$$$$$4$$$$$$4$$$$$$4$$$$$$4$$$Problem $$$3$$$$$$12$$$$$$10$$$$$$\\\\color{red}{8}$$$$$$6$$$$$$4$$$$$$3$$$Problem $$$4$$$$$$9$$$$$$5$$$$$$1$$$$$$1$$$$$$\\\\color{red}{1}$$$$$$1$$$Problem $$$5$$$$$$17$$$$$$\\\\color{red}{15}$$$$$$13$$$$$$11$$$$$$9$$$$$$7$$$Problem $$$6$$$$$$5$$$$$$5$$$$$$5$$$$$$5$$$$$$5$$$$$$\\\\color{red}{5}$$$The points displayed in red denote one of the optimal orders with the score $$$53$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6f753ed3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are participating in a coding competition with $n$ problems.
