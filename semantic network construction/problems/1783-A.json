Make it Beautifultime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAn array $$$a$$$ is calleduglyif it containsat least oneelement which is equal to thesum of all elements before it. If the array is not ugly, it isbeautiful.For example:the array $$$[6, 3, 9, 6]$$$ is ugly: the element $$$9$$$ is equal to $$$6 + 3$$$;the array $$$[5, 5, 7]$$$ is ugly: the element $$$5$$$ (the second one) is equal to $$$5$$$;the array $$$[8, 4, 10, 14]$$$ is beautiful: $$$8 \\\\ne 0$$$, $$$4 \\\\ne 8$$$, $$$10 \\\\ne 8 + 4$$$, $$$14 \\\\ne 8 + 4 + 10$$$, so there is no element which is equal to the sum of all elements before it.You are given an array $$$a$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le a_1 \\\\le a_2 \\\\le \\\\dots \\\\le a_n \\\\le 100$$$. You have toreorderthe elements of $$$a$$$ in such a way that the resulting array is beautiful. Note that you are not allowed to insert new elements or erase existing ones, you can only change the order of elements of $$$a$$$. You are allowed to keep the array $$$a$$$ unchanged, if it is beautiful.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_1 \\\\le a_2 \\\\le \\\\dots \\\\le a_n \\\\le 100$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer as follows:if it is impossible to reorder the elements of $$$a$$$ in such a way that it becomes beautiful, printNO;otherwise, in the first line, printYES. In the second line, print $$$n$$$ integers — any beautiful array which can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by reordering its elements. If there are multiple such arrays, print any of them.ExampleInput443 3 6 6210 1051 2 3 4 531 4 4OutputYES 3 6 3 6 NO YES 2 4 1 5 3 YES 1 4 4", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d1b3a3b9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a$ of length $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 50$) where $1 \\le a_1 \\le a_2 \\le ... \\le a_n \\le 100$.  \n\nAn array is considered \"ugly\" if there is an element in the array that is equal to the sum of all the elements before it.
