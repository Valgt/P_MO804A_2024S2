Deleting Divisorstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob are playing a game.They start with a positive integer $$$n$$$ and take alternating turns doing operations on it. Each turn a player can subtract from $$$n$$$ one of its divisors that isn't $$$1$$$ or $$$n$$$. The player who cannot make a move on his/her turn loses. Alice always moves first.Note that they subtract a divisor of thecurrentnumber in each turn.You are asked to find out who will win the game if both players play optimally.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the initial number.OutputFor each test case output \"Alice\" if Alice will win the game or \"Bob\" if Bob will win, if both players play optimally.ExampleInput4 1 4 12 69OutputBob Alice Alice BobNoteIn the first test case, the game ends immediately because Alice cannot make a move.In the second test case, Alice can subtract $$$2$$$ making $$$n = 2$$$, then Bob cannot make a move so Alice wins.In the third test case, Alice can subtract $$$3$$$ so that $$$n = 9$$$. Bob's only move is to subtract $$$3$$$ and make $$$n = 6$$$. Now, Alice can subtract $$$3$$$ again and $$$n = 3$$$.
