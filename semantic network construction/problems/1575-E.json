Eye-Pleasing City Park Tourtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a city park represented as a tree with $$$n$$$ attractions as its vertices and $$$n - 1$$$ rails as its edges. The $$$i$$$-th attraction has happiness value $$$a_i$$$.Each rail has a color. It is either black if $$$t_i = 0$$$, or white if $$$t_i = 1$$$. Black trains only operate on a black rail track, and white trains only operate on a white rail track. If you are previously on a black train and want to ride a white train, or you are previously on a white train and want to ride a black train, you need to use $$$1$$$ ticket.The path of a tour must be a simple path — it must not visit an attraction more than once. You do not need a ticket the first time you board a train. You only have $$$k$$$ tickets, meaningyou can only switch train types at most $$$k$$$ times. In particular, you do not need a ticket to go through a path consisting of one rail color.Define $$$f(u, v)$$$ as the sum of happiness values of the attractions in the tour $$$(u, v)$$$, which is a simple path that starts at the $$$u$$$-th attraction and ends at the $$$v$$$-th attraction. Find the sum of $$$f(u,v)$$$ for all valid tours $$$(u, v)$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq u \\\\leq v \\\\leq n$$$) that does not need more than $$$k$$$ tickets, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n-1$$$) — the number of attractions in the city park and the number of tickets you have.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the happiness value of each attraction.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains three integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$, and $$$t_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq u_i, v_i \\\\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\\\leq t_i \\\\leq 1$$$) — an edge between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ with color $$$t_i$$$. The given edges form a tree.OutputOutput an integer denoting the total happiness value for all valid tours $$$(u, v)$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq u \\\\leq v \\\\leq n$$$), modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExamplesInput5 0 1 3 2 6 4 1 2 1 1 4 0 3 2 1 2 5 0Output45Input3 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 0Output10", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1ca6f60e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ nodes, where each node represents an attraction with a happiness value $a_i$.
