Numberstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test64 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLittle Petya likes numbers a lot. He found that number 123 in base 16 consists of two digits: the first is 7 and the second is 11. So the sum of digits of 123 in base 16 is equal to 18.Now he wonders what is an average value of sum of digits of the numberAwritten in all bases from2toA- 1.Note that all computations should be done in base 10. You should find the result as an irreducible fraction, written in base 10.InputInput contains one integer numberA(3 ≤A≤ 1000).OutputOutput should contain required average value in format «X/Y», whereXis the numerator andYis the denominator.ExamplesInput5Output7/3Input3Output2/1NoteIn the first sample number 5 written in all bases from 2 to 4 looks so: 101, 12, 11. Sums of digits are 2, 3 and 2, respectively.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5f7f308b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $A$ (where $3 \\le A \\le 1000$).
