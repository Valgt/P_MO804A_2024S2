Great Sequencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA sequence of positive integers is calledgreatfor a positive integer $$$x$$$, if we can split it into pairs in such a way that in each pair the first number multiplied by $$$x$$$ is equal to the second number. More formally, a sequence $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ is great for a positive integer $$$x$$$, if $$$n$$$ is even and there exists a permutation $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$, such that for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le \\\\frac{n}{2}$$$) $$$a_{p_{2i-1}} \\\\cdot x = a_{p_{2i}}$$$.Sam has a sequence $$$a$$$ and a positive integer $$$x$$$. Help him to make the sequence great: find the minimum possible number of positive integers that should be added to the sequence $$$a$$$ to make it great for the number $$$x$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 20\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^6$$$).The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the minimum number of integers that can be added to the end of $$$a$$$ to make it a great sequence for the number $$$x$$$.ExampleInput44 41 16 4 46 21 2 2 2 4 75 35 2 3 5 159 1010 10 10 20 1 100 200 2000 3Output0 2 3 3NoteIn the first test case, Sam got lucky and the sequence is already great for the number $$$4$$$ because you can divide it into such pairs: $$$(1, 4)$$$, $$$(4, 16)$$$. Thus we can add $$$0$$$ numbers.In the second test case, you can add numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$14$$$ to the sequence, then you can divide all $$$8$$$ integers into such pairs: $$$(1, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 4)$$$, $$$(7, 14)$$$. It is impossible to add less than $$$2$$$ integers to fix the sequence.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "17aa99c7", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of positive integers and a positive integer $x$.
