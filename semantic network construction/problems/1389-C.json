The first and only line of each test case contains string $$$s$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$). Each character $$$s_i$$$ is digit0–9.It's guaranteed that the total length of strings doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum number of characters you need to erase from $$$s$$$ to make it good.ExampleInput3 95831 100120013 252525252525Output3 5 0NoteIn the first test case, you can erase any $$$3$$$ characters, for example, the $$$1$$$-st, the $$$3$$$-rd, and the $$$4$$$-th.
