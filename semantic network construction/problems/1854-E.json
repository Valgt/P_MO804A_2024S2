Each game has an associated enjoyment value. A game bundle consists of a subset of games whose total enjoyment value adds up to $$$60$$$.Your task is to choose $$$k$$$ games, where $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 60$$$, along with their respective enjoyment values $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_k$$$, in such a way that exactly $$$m$$$ distinct game bundles can be formed.InputThe input is a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 10^{10}$$$) — the desired number of game bundles.OutputThe first line should contain an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 60$$$) — the number of games.The second line should contain $$$k$$$ integers, $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_k \\\\le 60$$$) — the enjoyment values of the $$$k$$$ games.ExamplesInput4Output4 20 20 20 20Input722Output15 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1Input1Output1 60NoteIn the first sample, any subset of size $$$3$$$ is a game bundle.
