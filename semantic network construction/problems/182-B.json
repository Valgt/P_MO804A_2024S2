Vasya's Calendartime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutVasya lives in a strange world. The year hasnmonths and thei-th month hasaidays. Vasya got a New Year present — the clock that shows not only the time, but also the date.The clock's face can display any number from1tod. It is guaranteed thatai≤dfor allifrom1ton. The clock does not keep information about the current month, so when a new day comes, it simply increases the current day number by one. The clock cannot display numberd+ 1, so after day numberdit shows day1(the current day counter resets). The mechanism of the clock allows you to increase the day number by one manually. When you execute this operation, daydis also followed by day1.Vasya begins each day checking the day number on the clock. If the day number on the clock does not match the actual day number in the current month, then Vasya manually increases it by one. Vasya is persistent and repeats this operation until the day number on the clock matches the actual number of the current day in the current month.A year passed and Vasya wonders how many times he manually increased the day number by one, from the first day of the first month to the last day of then-th month inclusive, considering that on the first day of the first month the clock display showed day1.InputThe first line contains the single numberd— the maximum number of the day that Vasya's clock can show(1 ≤d≤ 106).The second line contains a single integern— the number of months in the year(1 ≤n≤ 2000).The third line containsnspace-separated integers:ai(1 ≤ai≤d)— the number of days in each month in the order in which they follow, starting from the first one.OutputPrint a single number — the number of times Vasya manually increased the day number by one throughout the last year.ExamplesInput422 2Output2Input533 4 3Output3Input311231 28 31 30 31 30 31 31 30 31 30 31Output7NoteIn the first sample the situation is like this:Day 1. Month 1. The clock shows1. Vasya changes nothing.Day 2. Month 1. The clock shows2. Vasya changes nothing.Day 1. Month 2. The clock shows3. Vasya manually increases the day number by1. After that the clock shows4. Vasya increases the day number by1manually. After that the clock shows1.Day 2. Month 2. The clock shows2.
