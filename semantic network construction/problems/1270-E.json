Divide Pointstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a set of $$$n\\\\ge 2$$$pairwise differentpoints with integer coordinates. Your task is to partition these points into twononemptygroups $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$, such that the following condition holds:For every two points $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$, write theEuclidean distancebetween them on the blackboard: if they belong to thesamegroup — with ayellowpen, and if they belong todifferentgroups — with abluepen.Then no yellow number is equal to any blue number.It is guaranteed that such a partition exists for any possible input. If there exist multiple partitions, you are allowed to output any of them.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^3)$$$ — the number of points.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point.It is guaranteed that all $$$n$$$ points are pairwise different.OutputIn the first line, output $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a \\\\le n-1$$$) — the number of points in a group $$$A$$$.In the second line, output $$$a$$$ integers — the indexes of points that you include into group $$$A$$$.If there are multiple answers, print any.ExamplesInput3 0 0 0 1 1 0Output1 1Input4 0 1 0 -1 1 0 -1 0Output2 1 2Input3 -2 1 1 1 -1 0Output1 2Input6 2 5 0 3 -4 -1 -5 -4 1 0 3 -1Output1 6Input2 -1000000 -1000000 1000000 1000000Output1 1NoteIn the first example, we set point $$$(0, 0)$$$ to group $$$A$$$ and points $$$(0, 1)$$$ and $$$(1, 0)$$$ to group $$$B$$$. In this way, we will have $$$1$$$ yellow number $$$\\\\sqrt{2}$$$ and $$$2$$$ blue numbers $$$1$$$ on the blackboard.In the second example, we set points $$$(0, 1)$$$ and $$$(0, -1)$$$ to group $$$A$$$ and points $$$(-1, 0)$$$ and $$$(1, 0)$$$ to group $$$B$$$.
