Besides, the teacher permitted him to perform the following operations with vectorА:Turn the vector by90degrees clockwise.Add to the vector a certain vectorC.Operations could be performed in any order any number of times.Can Gerald cope with the task?InputThe first line contains integersx1иy1— the coordinates of the vectorA(- 108≤x1,y1≤ 108). The second and the third line contain in the similar manner vectorsBandC(their coordinates are integers; their absolute value does not exceed108).OutputPrint \"YES\" (without the quotes) if it is possible to get vectorBusing the given operations.
