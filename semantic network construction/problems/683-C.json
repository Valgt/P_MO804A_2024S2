Your task is to print all numbers from the sets, that both sets don't contain simultaneously.InputThe first line contains the description of the first set, the second line contains the description of the second set. Each description begins with the number of elements in this set. All elements of the set follow in the arbitrary order. In each set all elements are distinct and both sets are not empty. The number of elements in each set doesn't exceed 1000. All elements of the sets are integers from -1000 to 1000.OutputPrint the number of the required numbers and then the numbers themselves separated by a space.ExamplesInput3 1 2 33 2 3 4Output2 1 4Input5 1 4 8 9 104 1 2 8 10Output3 2 4 9", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f90a9c67", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two sets of numbers.
