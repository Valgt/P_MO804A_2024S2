But what if we need to calculateφ(φ(...φ(n))), where functionφis takenktimes andnis given in the canonical decomposition into prime factors?You are givennandk, calculate the value ofφ(φ(...φ(n))). Print the result in the canonical decomposition into prime factors.InputThe first line contains integerm(1 ≤m≤ 105) — the number of distinct prime divisors in the canonical representaion ofn.Each of the nextmlines contains a pair of space-separated integerspi,ai(2 ≤pi≤ 106; 1 ≤ai≤ 1017) — another prime divisor of numbernand its power in the canonical representation. The sum of allaidoesn't exceed1017. Prime divisors in the input follow in the strictly increasing order.The last line contains integerk(1 ≤k≤ 1018).OutputIn the first line, print integerw— the number of distinct prime divisors of numberφ(φ(...φ(n))), where functionφis takenktimes.Each of the nextwlines must contain two space-separated integersqi,bi(bi≥ 1)— another prime divisor and its power in the canonical representaion of the result. Numbersqimust go in the strictly increasing order.ExamplesInput17 11Output22 13 1Input17 12Output12 1Input12 10000000000000000010000000000000000Output12 90000000000000000NoteYou can read about canonical representation of a positive integer here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic.You can read about functionφ(n)here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_totient_function.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "25a03a90", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a positive integer $n$ and an integer $k$.  \n\n*  $n$ is represented as a product of prime numbers raised to powers (its prime factorization). \n*  Calculate $\\phi(\\phi(\\phi(...\\phi(n))))$, where the $\\phi$ function is applied $k$ times. \n\nThe $\\phi(n)$ function (Euler's totient function) counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$ (their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nOutput the result as a product of prime numbers raised to powers."}, {"prompt_md5": "796c0516", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a number and a number k.
