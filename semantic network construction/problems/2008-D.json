Sakurako's Hobbytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor a certain permutation $$$p$$$$$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$$ Sakurako calls an integer $$$j$$$ reachable from an integer $$$i$$$ if it is possible to make $$$i$$$ equal to $$$j$$$ by assigning $$$i=p_i$$$ a certain number of times.If $$$p=[3,5,6,1,2,4]$$$, then, for example, $$$4$$$ is reachable from $$$1$$$, because: $$$i=1$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$i=p_1=3$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$i=p_3=6$$$ $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$i=p_6=4$$$. Now $$$i=4$$$, so $$$4$$$ is reachable from $$$1$$$.Each number in the permutation is colored either black or white.Sakurako defines the function $$$F(i)$$$ as the number of black integers that are reachable from $$$i$$$.Sakurako is interested in $$$F(i)$$$ for each $$$1\\\\le i\\\\le n$$$, but calculating all values becomes very difficult, so she asks you, as her good friend, to compute this.$$$^{\\\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation (the number $$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$, but the array contains $$$4$$$).InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$)  — the number of elements in the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le p_i\\\\le n$$$)  — the elements of the permutation.The third line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of '0' and '1'. If $$$s_i=0$$$, then the number $$$p_i$$$ is colored black; if $$$s_i=1$$$, then the number $$$p_i$$$ is colored white.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$F(1), F(2), \\\\dots, F(n)$$$.ExampleInput511051 2 4 5 31010155 4 1 3 21001163 5 6 1 2 401000061 2 3 4 5 6100110Output1  0 1 1 1 1  2 2 2 2 2  4 1 4 4 1 4  0 1 1 0 0 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "20a78567", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a permutation of integers from 1 to $n$.
