Vasya And The Matrixtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNow Vasya is taking an exam in mathematics. In order to get a good mark, Vasya needs to guess the matrix that the teacher has constructed!Vasya knows that the matrix consists ofnrows andmcolumns. For each row, he knows the xor (bitwise excluding or) of the elements in this row. The sequencea1,a2, ...,andenotes the xor of elements in rows with indices1,2, ...,n, respectively. Similarly, for each column, he knows the xor of the elements in this column. The sequenceb1,b2, ...,bmdenotes the xor of elements in columns with indices1,2, ...,m, respectively.Help Vasya! Find a matrix satisfying the given constraints or tell him that there is no suitable matrix.InputThe first line contains two numbersnandm(2 ≤n,m≤ 100)— the dimensions of the matrix.The second line containsnnumbersa1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤ 109), whereaiis the xor of all elements in rowi.The third line containsmnumbersb1,b2, ...,bm(0 ≤bi≤ 109), wherebiis the xor of all elements in columni.OutputIf there is no matrix satisfying the given constraints in the first line, output \"NO\".Otherwise, on the first line output \"YES\", and thennrows ofmnumbers in eachci1,ci2, ... ,cim(0 ≤cij≤ 2·109)— the description of the matrix.If there are several suitable matrices, it is allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput2 32 95 3 13OutputYES3 4 56 7 8Input3 31 7 62 15 12OutputNO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "63075b2a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given the dimensions of a matrix ($n$ rows and $m$ columns), you are given the XOR of each row and each column.  \n\nDetermine if a matrix with these given XOR values exists.
