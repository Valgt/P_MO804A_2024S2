Rational Resistancetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutMad scientist Mike is building a time machine in his spare time. To finish the work, he needs a resistor with a certain resistance value.However, all Mike has is lots of identical resistors with unit resistanceR0= 1. Elements with other resistance can be constructed from these resistors. In this problem, we will consider the following as elements:one resistor;an element andoneresistor plugged in sequence;an element andoneresistor plugged in parallel.With the consecutive connection the resistance of the new element equalsR=Re+R0. With the parallel connection the resistance of the new element equals. In this caseReequals the resistance of the element being connected.Mike needs to assemble an element with a resistance equal to the fraction. Determine the smallest possible number of resistors he needs to make such an element.InputThe single input line contains two space-separated integersaandb(1 ≤a,b≤ 1018). It is guaranteed that the fractionis irreducible. It is guaranteed that a solution always exists.OutputPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.Please do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is recommended to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecifier.ExamplesInput1 1Output1Input3 2Output3Input199 200Output200NoteIn the first sample, one resistor is enough.In the second sample one can connect the resistors in parallel, take the resulting element and connect it to a third resistor consecutively.
