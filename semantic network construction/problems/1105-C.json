Ayoub and Lost Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAyoub had an array $$$a$$$ of integers of size $$$n$$$ and this array had two interesting properties:All the integers in the array were between $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ (inclusive).The sum of all the elements was divisible by $$$3$$$.Unfortunately, Ayoub has lost his array, but he remembers the size of the array $$$n$$$ and the numbers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, so he asked you to find the number of ways to restore the array.Since the answer could be very large, print it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$ (i.e. the remainder when dividing by $$$10^9 + 7$$$). In case there are no satisfying arrays (Ayoub has a wrong memory), print $$$0$$$.InputThe first and only line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5 , 1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the size of the lost array and the range of numbers in the array.OutputPrint the remainder when dividing by $$$10^9 + 7$$$ the number of ways to restore the array.ExamplesInput2 1 3Output3Input3 2 2Output1Input9 9 99Output711426616NoteIn the first example, the possible arrays are : $$$[1,2], [2,1], [3, 3]$$$.In the second example, the only possible array is $$$[2, 2, 2]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9fc74eaf", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given three integers $n$, $l$, and $r$.
