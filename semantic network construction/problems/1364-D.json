Ehab's Last Corollarytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven a connected undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and an integer $$$k$$$, you have to either:either find an independent set that hasexactly$$$\\\\lceil\\\\frac{k}{2}\\\\rceil$$$ vertices.or find asimplecycle of lengthat most$$$k$$$.An independent set is a set of vertices such that no two of them are connected by an edge. A simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.I have a proof that for any input you can always solve at least one of these problems, but it's left as an exercise for the reader.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$n-1 \\\\le m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the parameter $$$k$$$ from the statement.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u,v \\\\le n$$$) that mean there's an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It's guaranteed that the graph is connected and doesn't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.OutputIf you choose to solve the first problem, then on the first line print $$$1$$$, followed by a line containing $$$\\\\lceil\\\\frac{k}{2}\\\\rceil$$$ distinct integers not exceeding $$$n$$$, the vertices in the desired independent set.If you, however, choose to solve the second problem, then on the first line print $$$2$$$, followed by a line containing one integer, $$$c$$$, representing the length of the found cycle, followed by a line containing $$$c$$$ distinct integers not exceeding $$$n$$$, the vertices in the desired cycle,in the order they appear in the cycle.ExamplesInput4 4 3 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1Output1 1 3Input4 5 3 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 2 4Output2 3 2 3 4Input4 6 3 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 1 3 2 4Output2 3 1 2 3Input5 4 5 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5Output1 1 4 5NoteIn the first sample:Notice that printing the independent set $$$\\\\{2,4\\\\}$$$ is also OK, but printing the cycle $$$1-2-3-4$$$ isn't, because its length must be at most $$$3$$$.In the second sample:Notice that printing the independent set $$$\\\\{1,3\\\\}$$$ or printing the cycle $$$2-1-4$$$ is also OK.In the third sample:In the fourth sample:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "96df2724", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, and an integer $k$ ($3 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^5$, $n-1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$), you must do one of the following:\n\n1.
