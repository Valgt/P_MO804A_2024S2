Roman and Numberstime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutRoman is a young mathematician, very famous in Uzhland. Unfortunately, Sereja doesn't think so. To make Sereja change his mind, Roman is ready to solve any mathematical problem. After some thought, Sereja asked Roma to find, how many numbers are close to numbern, modulom.Numberxis considered close to numbernmodulom, if:it can be obtained by rearranging the digits of numbern,it doesn't have any leading zeroes,the remainder after dividing numberxbymequals 0.Roman is a good mathematician, but the number of such numbers is too huge for him. So he asks you to help him.InputThe first line contains two integers:n(1 ≤n< 1018)andm(1 ≤m≤ 100).OutputIn a single line print a single integer — the number of numbers close to numbernmodulom.ExamplesInput104 2Output3Input223 4Output1Input7067678 8Output47NoteIn the first sample the required numbers are: 104, 140, 410.In the second sample the required number is 232.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "cd3bade0", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an integer $n$ and a positive integer $m$, find the number of integers that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n* They can be formed by rearranging the digits of $n$.\n* They do not have any leading zeros.\n* They are divisible by $m$."}, {"prompt_md5": "63463af4", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Count how many numbers can be made by rearranging the digits of a given number, don't start with zero, and are divisible by a given number."}]}
