Sum of Medianstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAmedianof an array of integers of length $$$n$$$ is the number standing on the $$$\\\\lceil {\\\\frac{n}{2}} \\\\rceil$$$ (rounding up) position in the non-decreasing ordering of its elements. Positions are numbered starting with $$$1$$$. For example, a median of the array $$$[2, 6, 4, 1, 3, 5]$$$ is equal to $$$3$$$.There exist some other definitions of the median, but in this problem, we will use the described one.Given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ andnon-decreasingarray of $$$nk$$$ integers. Divide all numbers into $$$k$$$ arrays of size $$$n$$$, such that each number belongs toexactlyone array.You want the sum of medians of all $$$k$$$ arrays to be the maximum possible. Find this maximum possible sum.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The next $$$2t$$$ lines contain descriptions of test cases.The first line of the description of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, k \\\\leq 1000$$$).The second line of the description of each test case contains $$$nk$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{nk}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — given array. It is guaranteed that the array is non-decreasing: $$$a_1 \\\\leq a_2 \\\\leq \\\\ldots \\\\leq a_{nk}$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$nk$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the maximum possible sum of medians of all $$$k$$$ arrays.ExampleInput6 2 4 0 24 34 58 62 64 69 78 2 2 27 61 81 91 4 3 2 4 16 18 21 27 36 53 82 91 92 95 3 4 3 11 12 22 33 35 38 67 69 71 94 99 2 1 11 41 3 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1Output165 108 145 234 11 3NoteThe examples of possible divisions into arrays for all test cases of the first test:Test case $$$1$$$: $$$[0, 24], [34, 58], [62, 64], [69, 78]$$$.
