I guess we should have named it \"To Zero\".You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, each of these arrays contains $$$n$$$ non-negative integers.Let $$$c$$$ be a matrix of size $$$n \\\\times n$$$ such that $$$c_{i,j} = |a_i - b_j|$$$ for every $$$i \\\\in [1, n]$$$ and every $$$j \\\\in [1, n]$$$.Your goal is to transform the matrix $$$c$$$ so that it becomes the zero matrix, i. e. a matrix whereeveryelement isexactly$$$0$$$.
