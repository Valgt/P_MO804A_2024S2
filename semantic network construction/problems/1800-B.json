Count the Number of Pairstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKristina has a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. For each pair of lowercase letter and its matching uppercase letter, Kristina can get $$$1$$$ burl. However, pairs of characters cannot overlap, so each character can only be in one pair.For example, if she has the string $$$s$$$ = \"aAaaBACacbE\", she can get a burl for the following character pairs:$$$s_1$$$ = \"a\" and $$$s_2$$$ = \"A\"$$$s_4$$$ = \"a\" and $$$s_6$$$ = \"A\"$$$s_5$$$ = \"B\" and $$$s_{10}$$$ = \"b\"$$$s_7$$$= \"C\" and $$$s_9$$$ = \"c\"Kristina wants to get more burles for her string, so she is going to perform no more than $$$k$$$ operations on it. In one operation, she can:either select the lowercase character $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$) and make it uppercase.or select uppercase character $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$) and make it lowercase.For example, when $$$k$$$ = 2 and $$$s$$$ = \"aAaaBACacbE\" it can perform one operation: choose $$$s_3$$$ = \"a\" and make it uppercase. Then she will get another pair of $$$s_3$$$ = \"A\" and $$$s_8$$$ = \"a\"Findmaximumnumber of burles Kristina can get for her string.InputThe first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$) — the number of characters in the string and the maximum number of operations that can be performed on it.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print exactly one integer on a separate line: the maximum number of burles that Kristina can get for her string $$$s$$$.ExampleInput511 2aAaaBACacbE2 2ab4 1aaBB6 0abBAcC5 3cbccbOutput5 0 1 3 2NoteThe first test case is explained in the problem statement.In the second test case, it is not possible to get any pair by performing any number of operations.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "26e7af68", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string of lowercase and uppercase letters.
