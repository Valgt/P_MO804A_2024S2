Dirty Arkady's Kitchentime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputArkady likes to walk around his kitchen. His labyrinthine kitchen consists of several important places connected with passages. Unfortunately it happens that these passages are flooded with milk so that it's impossible to pass through them. Namely, it's possible to pass through each passage in any direction only during some time interval.The lengths of all passages are equal and Arkady makes through them in one second. For security reasons, Arkady can never stop, also, he can't change direction while going through a passage. In other words, if he starts walking in some passage, he should reach its end and immediately leave the end.Today Arkady needs to quickly reach important placenfrom place1. He plans to exit the place1at time moment0and reach the placenas early as he can. Please find the minimum time he should spend on his way.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 5·105,0 ≤m≤ 5·105) — the number of important places and the number of passages, respectively.After that,mlines follow, each of them describe one passage. Each line contains four integersa,b,landr(1 ≤a,b≤n,a≠b,0 ≤l<r≤ 109) — the places the passage connects and the time segment during which it's possible to use this passage.OutputPrint one integer — minimum time Arkady should spend to reach the destination.
