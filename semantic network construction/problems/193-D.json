A segment[l,r](l≤r) is a set of elementspisatisfyingl≤i≤r.Nick calls a pair of segments[a0,a1]and[b0,b1](1 ≤a0≤a1<b0≤b1≤n) good if all their(a1-a0+b1-b0+ 2)elements, when sorted in ascending order, form an arithmetic progression with a difference of1. That is, when they sorted in ascending order, the elements are in the form{x,x+ 1,x+ 2, ...,x+m- 1}, for somexandm.Your task is to find the number of distinct pairs of good segments in the given permutation. Two pairs of segments are considered distinct if the sets of elements contained in these pairs of segments are distinct. For example, any segment[l,r](l<r)can be represented as a pair of segments, as[l,i]and[i+ 1,r](l≤i≤r). As all these pairs consist of the same set of elements, they are considered identical.See the notes accompanying the sample tests for clarification.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 3·105) — the permutation size.
