Diverse Matrixtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet $$$a$$$ be a matrix of size $$$r \\\\times c$$$ containing positive integers, not necessarily distinct. Rows of the matrix are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$r$$$, columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$c$$$. We can construct an array $$$b$$$ consisting of $$$r + c$$$ integers as follows: for each $$$i \\\\in [1, r]$$$, let $$$b_i$$$ be the greatest common divisor of integers in the $$$i$$$-th row, and for each $$$j \\\\in [1, c]$$$ let $$$b_{r+j}$$$ be the greatest common divisor of integers in the $$$j$$$-th column.We call the matrixdiverseif all $$$r + c$$$ numbers $$$b_k$$$ ($$$k \\\\in [1, r + c]$$$) are pairwise distinct.Themagnitudeof a matrix equals to the maximum of $$$b_k$$$.For example, suppose we have the following matrix:$$$\\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 9 & 7\\\\\\\\ 4 & 144 & 84 \\\\end{pmatrix}$$$We construct the array $$$b$$$:$$$b_1$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$2$$$, $$$9$$$, and $$$7$$$, that is $$$1$$$;$$$b_2$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$4$$$, $$$144$$$, and $$$84$$$, that is $$$4$$$;$$$b_3$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$, that is $$$2$$$;$$$b_4$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$9$$$ and $$$144$$$, that is $$$9$$$;$$$b_5$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$7$$$ and $$$84$$$, that is $$$7$$$.So $$$b = [1, 4, 2, 9, 7]$$$. All values in this array are distinct, so the matrix is diverse. The magnitude is equal to $$$9$$$.For a given $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$, find a diverse matrix that minimises the magnitude. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. If there are no solutions, output a single integer $$$0$$$.InputThe only line in the input contains two space separated integers $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq r,c \\\\leq 500$$$) — the number of rows and the number of columns of the matrix to be found.OutputIf there is no solution, output a single integer $$$0$$$.Otherwise, output $$$r$$$ rows. The $$$i$$$-th of them should contain $$$c$$$ space-separated integers, the $$$j$$$-th of which is $$$a_{i,j}$$$ — the positive integer in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column of a diverse matrix minimizing the magnitude.Furthermore, it must hold that $$$1 \\\\leq a_{i,j} \\\\leq 10^9$$$. It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is also a solution with this additional constraint (still having minimum possible magnitude).ExamplesInput2 2Output4 12 2 9Input1 1Output0NoteIn the first example, the GCDs of rows are $$$b_1 = 4$$$ and $$$b_2 = 1$$$, and the GCDs of columns are $$$b_3 = 2$$$ and $$$b_4 = 3$$$. All GCDs are pairwise distinct and the maximum of them is $$$4$$$. Since the GCDs have to be distinct and at least $$$1$$$, it is clear that there are no diverse matrices of size $$$2 \\\\times 2$$$ with magnitude smaller than $$$4$$$.In the second example, no matter what $$$a_{1,1}$$$ is, $$$b_1 = b_2$$$ will always hold, so there are no diverse matrices.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "eb8ef7ea", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given two integers $r$ and $c$, find a matrix of size $r \\times c$ with positive integers as its elements.
