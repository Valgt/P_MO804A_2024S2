Palindrome XORtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of characters \"1\", \"0\", and \"?\". The first character of $$$s$$$ is guaranteed to be \"1\". Let $$$m$$$ be the number of characters in $$$s$$$.Count the number of ways we can choose a pair of integers $$$a, b$$$ that satisfies the following:$$$1 \\\\leq a < b < 2^m$$$When written without leading zeros, the base-2 representations of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are both palindromes.The base-2 representation ofbitwise XORof $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ matches the pattern $$$s$$$. We say that $$$t$$$ matches $$$s$$$ if the lengths of $$$t$$$ and $$$s$$$ are the same and for every $$$i$$$, the $$$i$$$-th character of $$$t$$$ is equal to the $$$i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$, or the $$$i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ is \"?\".Compute this count modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq |s| \\\\leq 1\\\\,000$$$). $$$s$$$ consists only of characters \"1\", \"0\" and \"?\".
