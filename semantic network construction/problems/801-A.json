Vicious Keyboardtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTonio has a keyboard with only two letters, \"V\" and \"K\".One day, he has typed out a stringswith only these two letters. He really likes it when the string \"VK\" appears, so he wishes to change at most one letter in the string (or do no changes) to maximize the number of occurrences of that string. Compute the maximum number of times \"VK\" can appear as a substring (i.Â e. a letter \"K\" right after a letter \"V\") in the resulting string.InputThe first line will contain a stringsconsisting only of uppercase English letters \"V\" and \"K\" with length not less than1and not greater than100.OutputOutput a single integer, the maximum number of times \"VK\" can appear as a substring of the given string after changing at most one character.ExamplesInputVKOutput1InputVVOutput1InputVOutput0InputVKKKKKKKKKVVVVVVVVVKOutput3InputKVKVOutput1NoteFor the first case, we do not change any letters. \"VK\" appears once, which is the maximum number of times it could appear.For the second case, we can change the second character from a \"V\" to a \"K\". This will give us the string \"VK\". This has one occurrence of the string \"VK\" as a substring.For the fourth case, we can change the fourth character from a \"K\" to a \"V\". This will give us the string \"VKKVKKKKKKVVVVVVVVVK\". This has three occurrences of the string \"VK\" as a substring. We can check no other moves can give us strictly more occurrences.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "11fc1ed4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string consisting only of the letters \"V\" and \"K\".
