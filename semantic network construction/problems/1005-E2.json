If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is used.For example, if $$$a=[4, 2, 7, 5]$$$ then its median is $$$4$$$ since after sorting the sequence, it will look like $$$[2, 4, 5, 7]$$$ and the left of two middle elements is equal to $$$4$$$. The median of $$$[7, 1, 2, 9, 6]$$$ equals $$$6$$$ since after sorting, the value $$$6$$$ will be in the middle of the sequence.Write a program to find the number of pairs of indices $$$(l, r)$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$) such that the value of median of $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\\\dots, a_r$$$ is exactly the given number $$$m$$$.InputThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n,m \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) â€” the length of the given sequence and the required value of the median.The second line contains an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$).OutputPrint the required number.ExamplesInput5 41 4 5 60 4Output8Input3 11 1 1Output6Input15 21 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3Output97NoteIn the first example, the suitable pairs of indices are: $$$(1, 3)$$$, $$$(1, 4)$$$, $$$(1, 5)$$$, $$$(2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 5)$$$, $$$(4, 5)$$$ and $$$(5, 5)$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2d0665d8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
