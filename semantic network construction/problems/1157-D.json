N Problems During K Daystime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp has to solve exactly $$$n$$$ problems to improve his programming skill before an important programming competition. But this competition will be held very soon, most precisely, it will start in $$$k$$$ days. It means that Polycarp has exactly $$$k$$$ days for training!Polycarp doesn't want to procrastinate, so he wants to solve at least one problem during each of $$$k$$$ days. He also doesn't want to overwork, so if he solves $$$x$$$ problems during some day, he should solve no more than $$$2x$$$ problems during the next day. And, at last, he wants to improve his skill, so if he solves $$$x$$$ problems during some day, he should solve at least $$$x+1$$$ problem during the next day.More formally: let $$$[a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_k]$$$ be the array of numbers of problems solved by Polycarp. The $$$i$$$-th element of this array is the number of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$i$$$-th day of his training. Then the following conditions must be satisfied:sum of all $$$a_i$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ should be $$$n$$$;$$$a_i$$$ should begreater than zerofor each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$;the condition $$$a_i < a_{i + 1} \\\\le 2 a_i$$$ should be satisfied for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k-1$$$.Your problem is to findanyarray $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$ satisfying the conditions above or say that it is impossible to do it.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9, 1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^5$$$) â€” the number of problems Polycarp wants to solve and the number of days Polycarp wants to train.OutputIf it is impossible to find any array $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$ satisfying Polycarp's rules of training, print \"NO\" in the first line.Otherwise print \"YES\" in the first line, then print $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_k$$$ in the second line, where $$$a_i$$$ should be the number of problems Polycarp should solve during the $$$i$$$-th day.
