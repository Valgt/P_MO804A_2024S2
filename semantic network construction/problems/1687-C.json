Sanae and Giant Robottime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIs it really?! The robot only existing in my imagination?! The Colossal Walking Robot?!!— Kochiya SanaeSanae made a giant robot — Hisoutensoku, but something is wrong with it. To make matters worse, Sanae can not figure out how to stop it, and she is forced to fix it on-the-fly.The state of a robot can be represented by an array of integers of length $$$n$$$. Initially, the robot is at state $$$a$$$. She wishes to turn it into state $$$b$$$.As a great programmer, Sanae knows the art of copy-and-paste. In one operation, she can choose some segment from given segments, copy the segment from $$$b$$$ and paste it intothe same placeof the robot, replacing the original state there. However, she has to ensure that the sum of $$$a$$$does not changeafter each copy operation in case the robot go haywire. Formally, Sanae can choose segment $$$[l,r]$$$ and assign $$$a_i = b_i$$$ ($$$l\\\\le i\\\\le r$$$) if $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^n a_i$$$ does not change after the operation.Determine whether it is possible for Sanae to successfully turn the robot from the initial state $$$a$$$ to the desired state $$$b$$$ with any (possibly, zero) operations.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n\\\\leq 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq m\\\\leq 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and the number of segments.The second line contains $$$n$$$ intergers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the initial state $$$a$$$.The third line contains $$$n$$$ intergers $$$b_1,b_2,\\\\ldots,b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq b_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the desired state $$$b$$$.Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line contains two intergers $$$l_i,r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq l_i < r_i \\\\leq n$$$) — the segments that can be copy-pasted by Sanae.It is guaranteed that both the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if $$$a$$$ can be turned into $$$b$$$, or \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.You can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yEs\", \"yes\" and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput25 21 5 4 2 33 2 5 4 11 32 55 21 5 4 2 33 2 4 5 11 22 4OutputYES NONoteTest case 1:One possible way of turning $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$:First, select $$$[1,3]$$$. After the operation, $$$a=[3,2,5,2,3]$$$.Then, select $$$[2,5]$$$.
