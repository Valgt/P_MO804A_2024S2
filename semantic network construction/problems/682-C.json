Alyona and the Treetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlyona decided to go on a diet and went to the forest to get some apples. There she unexpectedly found a magic rooted tree with root in the vertex1, every vertex and every edge of which has a number written on.The girl noticed that some of the tree's vertices aresad, so she decided to play with them. Let's call vertexvsadif there is a vertexuin subtree of vertexvsuch thatdist(v,u) >au, whereauis the number written on vertexu,dist(v,u)is the sum of the numbers written on the edges on the path fromvtou.Leavesof a tree are vertices connected to a single vertex by a single edge, but the root of a tree is aleafif and only if the tree consists of a single vertex — root.Thus Alyona decided to remove some of tree leaves until there will be no any sad vertex left in the tree. What is the minimum number of leaves Alyona needs to remove?InputIn the first line of the input integern(1 ≤n≤ 105) is given — the number of vertices in the tree.In the second line the sequence ofnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) is given, whereaiis the number written on vertexi.The nextn- 1lines describe tree edges:ithof them consists of two integerspiandci(1 ≤pi≤n,- 109≤ci≤ 109), meaning that there is an edge connecting verticesi+ 1andpiwith numberciwritten on it.OutputPrint the only integer — the minimum number of leaves Alyona needs to remove such that there will be no any sad vertex left in the tree.ExampleInput988 22 83 14 95 91 98 53 113 247 -81 671 649 655 126 -803 8Output5NoteThe following image represents possible process of removing leaves from the tree:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0aa5a4cd", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a rooted tree with $n$ vertices.
