Ruminations on Ruminantstime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKevin Sun is ruminating on the origin of cows while standing at the origin of the Cartesian plane. He noticesnlineson the plane, each representable by an equation of the formax+by=c. He also observes that no two lines are parallel and that no three lines pass through the same point.For each triple(i,j,k)such that1 ≤i<j<k≤n, Kevin considers the triangle formed by the three lines. He calls a triangleoriginalif the circumcircle of that triangle passes through the origin. Since Kevin believes that the circles of bovine life are tied directly to such triangles, he wants to know the number of original triangles formed by unordered triples of distinct lines.Recall that thecircumcircleof a triangle is the circle which passes through all the vertices of that triangle.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(3 ≤n≤ 2000), the number of lines.The nextnlines describe lines. Thei-th of these lines contains three space-separated integersai,bi,ci(|ai|, |bi|, |ci| ≤ 10 000,ai2+bi2> 0), representing the equationaix+biy=ciof line.OutputPrint a single integer, the number of triples(i,j,k)withi<j<ksuch that linesform an original triangle.ExamplesInput41 0 00 1 01 1 -11 -1 2Output2Input30 1 11 1 21 -1 -2Output1NoteNote that in the first sample, some of the lines pass through the origin.In the second sample, there is exactly one triple of lines:y= 1,x+y= 2,x-y=  - 2.The triangle they form has vertices(0, 2), (1, 1), ( - 1, 1).
