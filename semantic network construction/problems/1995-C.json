Squaringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputikrpprppfound an array $$$a$$$ consisting of integers. He likes justice, so he wants to make $$$a$$$ fair — that is, make it non-decreasing. To do that, he can perform anact of justiceon an index $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$ of the array, which will replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_i ^ 2$$$ (the element at position $$$i$$$ with its square). For example, if $$$a = [2,4,3,3,5,3]$$$ andikrpprppchooses to perform an act of justice on $$$i = 4$$$, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2,4,3,9,5,3]$$$.What is the minimum number of acts of justice needed to make the array non-decreasing?InputFirst line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. It is followed by the description of test cases.For each test case, the first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ — size of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10 ^5$$$) integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10 ^ 6$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot {10}^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print an integer — minimum number of acts of justice required to make the array $$$a$$$ non-decreasing. If it is impossible to do that, print $$$-1$$$.ExampleInput731 2 323 233 1 541 1 2 334 3 2916 2 4 2 256 2 4 2 81110010 10009 10008 10007 10006 10005 10004 10003 10002 10001 10000Output0 1 -1 0 3 15 55NoteIn the first test case, there's no need to perform acts of justice. The array is fair on its own!In the third test case, it can be proven that the array cannot become non-decreasing.In the fifth test case,ikrpprpppcan perform an act of justice on index 3, then an act of justice on index 2, and finally yet another act of justice on index 3. After that, $$$a$$$ will become $$$[4, 9, 16]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a4632a8a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
