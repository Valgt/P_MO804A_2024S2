A pair of its non-empty substrings $$$(a, b)$$$ is calledentangledif there is a (possibly empty) link string $$$c$$$ such that:Every occurrence of $$$a$$$ in $$$s$$$ is immediately followed by $$$cb$$$;Every occurrence of $$$b$$$ in $$$s$$$ is immediately preceded by $$$ac$$$.In other words, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ occur in $$$s$$$ only as substrings of $$$acb$$$. Compute the total number of entangled pairs of substrings of $$$s$$$.A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero or all) characters from the end.InputThe first and only line contains a string $$$s$$$ of lowercase English letters ($$$1 \\\\leq |s| \\\\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the string for which you should count pairs of entangled substrings.OutputOutput a single integer, the number of entangled pairs of substrings of $$$s$$$.ExamplesInputabbaOutput1InputabacabaOutput0InputabcabcabcabcOutput5InputadamantOutput82NoteIn the first example, the only entangled pair is (ab,ba).
