Perfect Pairtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLet us call a pair of integer numbersm-perfect, if at least one number in the pair is greater than or equal tom.

It is allowed to erase one of them and replace it with the sum of the numbers,(x+y).What is the minimum number of such operations one has to perform in order to make the given pair of integersm-perfect?InputSingle line of the input contains three integersx,yandm(- 1018≤x,y,m≤ 1018).Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.
