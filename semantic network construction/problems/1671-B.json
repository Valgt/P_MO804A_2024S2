Consecutive Points Segmenttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given $$$n$$$ points with integer coordinates on a coordinate axis $$$OX$$$. The coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th point is $$$x_i$$$. All points' coordinates are distinct and given in strictly increasing order.For each point $$$i$$$, you can do the following operationno more than once: take this point and move it by $$$1$$$ to the left or to the right (i..e., you can change its coordinate $$$x_i$$$ to $$$x_i - 1$$$ or to $$$x_i + 1$$$). In other words, for each point, you choose (separately) its new coordinate. For the $$$i$$$-th point, it can be either $$$x_i - 1$$$, $$$x_i$$$ or $$$x_i + 1$$$.Your task is to determine if you can move some points as described above in such a way that the new set of points forms aconsecutive segmentof integers, i. e. for some integer $$$l$$$ the coordinates of points should be equal to $$$l, l + 1, \\\\ldots, l + n - 1$$$.Note that the resulting points should havedistinctcoordinates.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of points in the set $$$x$$$.The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1 < x_2 < \\\\ldots < x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i \\\\le 10^6$$$), where $$$x_i$$$ is the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th point.It is guaranteed that the points are given in strictly increasing order (this also means that all coordinates are distinct). It is also guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — if the set of points from the test case can be moved to form a consecutive segment of integers, printYES, otherwise printNO.ExampleInput521 431 2 341 2 3 71100000032 5 6OutputYES YES NO YES YES", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "790233c3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ distinct integers $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ that are in strictly increasing order.
