Unfortunately, each of them solved only one problem, though successfully submitted it at the first attempt. Misha solved the problem that costsapoints and Vasya solved the problem that costsbpoints. Besides, Misha submitted the problemcminutes after the contest started and Vasya submitted the problemdminutes after the contest started. As you know, on Codeforces the cost of a problem reduces as a round continues. That is, if you submit a problem that costsppointstminutes after the contest started, you getpoints.Misha and Vasya are having an argument trying to find out who got more points.
