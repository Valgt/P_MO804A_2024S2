Super-Permutationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA permutation is a sequence $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[1]$$$, $$$[3,5,2,1,4]$$$, $$$[1,3,2]$$$ are permutations, while $$$[2,3,2]$$$, $$$[4,3,1]$$$, $$$[0]$$$ are not.Given a permutation $$$a$$$, we construct an array $$$b$$$, where $$$b_i = (a_1 + a_2 +~\\\\dots~+ a_i) \\\\bmod n$$$.A permutation of numbers $$$[a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n]$$$ is called asuper-permutationif $$$[b_1 + 1, b_2 + 1, \\\\dots, b_n + 1]$$$ is also a permutation of length $$$n$$$.Grisha became interested whether asuper-permutationof length $$$n$$$ exists. Help him solve this non-trivial problem. Output anysuper-permutationof length $$$n$$$, if it exists. Otherwise, output $$$-1$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.Each test case consists of a single line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the desired permutation.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output in a separate line:$$$n$$$ integers — asuper-permutationof length $$$n$$$, if it exists.$$$-1$$$, otherwise.If there are several suitable permutations, output any of them.ExampleInput41236Output1 2 1 -1 6 5 2 3 4 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "cbec4732", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a permutation of numbers from 1 to $n$, we create a new array $b$ where each element $b_i$ is the sum of the first $i$ elements of the original permutation, modulo $n$.\n\nDetermine if there exists a permutation of numbers from 1 to $n$ such that the array $b$ created from it, when each element is incremented by 1, also forms a valid permutation of length $n$.
