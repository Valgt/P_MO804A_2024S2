So, we have $$$4$$$ polygons with number of sides $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$ and $$$6$$$ to choose from and if we choose the triangle and the hexagon, then we can arrange them as shown in the picture in the statement.Hence, the minimum number of points required on the circle is $$$6$$$, which is also the minimum overall possible sets.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7c6d7d7a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers $n$ and $k$.
