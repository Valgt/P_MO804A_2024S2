Abnormal Permutation Pairs (easy version)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:$$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$.Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$. Note that $$$mod$$$ may not be a prime.InputThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$mod$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 50$$$, $$$1\\\\le mod\\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint one integer, which is the answer modulo $$$mod$$$.ExampleInput4 403458273Output17NoteThe following are all valid pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ when $$$n=4$$$.$$$p=[1,3,4,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,$$$p=[1,4,2,3]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,$$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,$$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,4,3]$$$,$$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,3,1,4]$$$,$$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,$$$p=[2,3,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,$$$p=[2,4,1,3]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,$$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,$$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,4,2]$$$,$$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,2,1,4]$$$,$$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,$$$p=[3,2,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,$$$p=[3,4,1,2]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,$$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,$$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,3,2]$$$,$$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,2,1,3]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a54c416b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$.  \n\nFind the number of pairs of permutations $(p,q)$ of the numbers 1 through $n$ that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n* $p$ is lexicographically smaller than $q$.\n* The number of inversions in $p$ is greater than the number of inversions in $q$.\n\nAn inversion in a permutation is a pair of indices $(i,j)$ where $i < j$ and $p_i > p_j$.\n\nPrint the number of such pairs modulo $mod$."}, {"prompt_md5": "90917fa1", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number *n*, find the number of pairs of ordered lists of numbers from 1 to *n* that meet these conditions:\n\n1.
