The main feature of these articles is that each of them uses at most two distinct letters. Andrew decided to send an article to the magazine, but as he hasn't written any article, he just decided to take a random one from magazine 26Char. However, before sending it to the magazine 2Char, he needs to adapt the text to the format of the journal. To do so, he removes some words from the chosen article, in such a way that the remaining text can be written using no more than two distinct letters.Since the payment depends from the number of non-space characters in the article, Andrew wants to keep the words with the maximum total length.InputThe first line of the input contains numbern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of words in the article chosen by Andrew. Following arenlines, each of them contains one word. All the words consist only of small English letters and their total length doesn't exceed1000. The words are not guaranteed to be distinct, in this case you are allowed to use a word in the article as many times as it appears in the input.OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum possible total length of words in Andrew's article.ExamplesInput4abbcaccaaabbbOutput9Input5aabcbcbcdecdecdecdecdecdeaaaaOutput6NoteIn the first sample the optimal way to choose words is {'abb', 'aaa', 'bbb'}.In the second sample the word 'cdecdecdecdecdecde' consists of three distinct letters, and thus cannot be used in the article. The optimal answer is {'a', 'a', 'aaaa'}.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "afc58637", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of words.
