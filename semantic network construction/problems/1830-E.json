Bully Sorttime limit per test10 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOn a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, we define a bully swap as follows:Let $$$i$$$ be the index of the largest element $$$p_i$$$ such that $$$p_i \\\\neq i$$$.Let $$$j$$$ be the index of the smallest element $$$p_j$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$.Swap $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$.We define $$$f(p)$$$ as the number of bully swaps we need to perform until $$$p$$$ becomes sorted. Note that if $$$p$$$ is the identity permutation, $$$f(p)=0$$$.You are given $$$n$$$ and a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You need to process the following $$$q$$$ updates.In each update, you are given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. You will swap $$$p_x$$$ and $$$p_y$$$ and then find the value of $$$f(p)$$$.Note that the updates are persistent. Changes made to the permutation $$$p$$$ will apply when processing future updates.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the length of the permutation and the number of updates.The second line of input contains $$$n$$$ integer $$$p_1,p_2,\\\\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq p_i \\\\leq n$$$) — the permutation $$$p$$$. All elements of $$$p$$$ are distinct.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines of input contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i < y_i \\\\le n$$$) — describing the $$$i$$$-th update.OutputAfter each update, output $$$f(p)$$$.ExampleInput8 5 6 2 1 5 3 4 7 8 1 8 2 3 4 7 7 8 3 6Output5 6 9 8 7NoteAfter the first update, we have $$$f(p)=5$$$.
