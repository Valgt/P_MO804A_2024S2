All $$$n$$$ points move with the constant speed, the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th point at the moment $$$t$$$ ($$$t$$$can be non-integer) is calculated as $$$x_i + t \\\\cdot v_i$$$.Consider two points $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$. Let $$$d(i, j)$$$ be the minimum possible distance between these two points over any possible moments of time (evennon-integer).
