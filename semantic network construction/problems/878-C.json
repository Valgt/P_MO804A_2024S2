Tournamenttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecently a tournament inkkinds of sports has begun in Berland. Vasya wants to make money on the bets.The scheme of the tournament is very mysterious and not fully disclosed. Competitions are held back to back, each of them involves two sportsmen who have not left the tournament yet. Each match can be held in any of thekkinds of sport. Loser leaves the tournament. The last remaining sportsman becomes the winner. Apart of this, the scheme can be arbitrary, it is not disclosed in advance.Vasya knows powers of sportsmen in each kind of sport. He believes that the sportsmen with higher power always wins.The tournament is held every year, and each year one new participant joins it. In the first tournament, only one sportsman has participated, in the second there were two sportsmen, and so on. Vasya has been watching the tournament for the lastnyears. Help him to find the number of possible winners for each of thentournaments.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 5·104,1 ≤k≤ 10) — the number of tournaments and the number of kinds of sport, respectively.Each of the nextnlines containskintegerssi1,si2, ...,sik(1 ≤sij≤ 109), wheresijis the power of thei-th sportsman in thej-th kind of sport. The sportsman with higher powers always wins. It's guaranteed that for any kind of sport all of these powers are distinct.OutputFor each of thentournaments output the number of contenders who can win.ExamplesInput3 21 55 110 10Output121Input3 22 23 31 10Output113Input3 22 31 13 2Output112NoteIn the first sample:In the first tournament there is only one sportsman, and he is the winner.In the second tournament, there are two sportsmen, and everyone can defeat another, depending on kind of sports.In the third tournament, the third sportsman in the strongest in both kinds of sports, so he is the winner regardless of the scheme.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6ea87be5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ tournaments and $k$ types of sports.
