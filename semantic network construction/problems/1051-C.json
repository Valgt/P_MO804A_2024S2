Vasya and Multisetstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya has a multiset $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integer numbers. Vasya calls some number $$$x$$$ nice if it appears in the multiset exactly once. For example, multiset $$$\\\\{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4\\\\}$$$ contains nice numbers $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$.Vasya wants to split multiset $$$s$$$ into two multisets $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$(one of which may be empty)in such a way that the quantity of nice numbers in multiset $$$a$$$ would be the same as the quantity of nice numbers in multiset $$$b$$$ (the quantity of numbers to appear exactly once in multiset $$$a$$$ and the quantity of numbers to appear exactly once in multiset $$$b$$$).InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n~(2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100)$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\dots s_n~(1 \\\\le s_i \\\\le 100)$$$ â€” the multiset $$$s$$$.OutputIf there exists no split of $$$s$$$ to satisfy the given requirements, then print \"NO\" in the first line.Otherwise print \"YES\" in the first line.The second line should contain a string, consisting of $$$n$$$ characters. $$$i$$$-th character should be equal to 'A' if the $$$i$$$-th element of multiset $$$s$$$ goes to multiset $$$a$$$ and 'B' if if the $$$i$$$-th element of multiset $$$s$$$ goes to multiset $$$b$$$.Elements are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in the order they are given in the input.If there exist multiple solutions, then print any of them.ExamplesInput43 5 7 1OutputYESBABAInput33 5 1OutputNO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "94f11818", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of $n$ integers.
