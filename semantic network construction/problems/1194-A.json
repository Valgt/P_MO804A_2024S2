On the $$$i$$$-th step you wipe the $$$i$$$-th number (considering onlyremainingnumbers). You wipethe whole number(not one digit).When there are less than $$$i$$$ numbers remaining, you stop your algorithm.Now you wonder: what is the value of the $$$x$$$-th remaining number after the algorithm is stopped?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of queries. The next $$$T$$$ lines contain queries — one per line. All queries are independent.Each line contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x < n \\\\le 10^{9}$$$) — the length of the list and the position we wonder about. It's guaranteed that after the algorithm ends, the list will still contain at least $$$x$$$ numbers.OutputPrint $$$T$$$ integers (one per query) — the values of the $$$x$$$-th number after performing the algorithm for the corresponding queries.ExampleInput3 3 1 4 2 69 6Output2 4 12", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6a6e1487", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of numbers from 1 to $n$.
