Wet Shark and Bishopstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputToday, Wet Shark is givennbishops on a1000by1000grid. Both rows and columns of the grid are numbered from1to1000. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right.Wet Shark thinks that two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. Note, that this is the only criteria, so two bishops may attack each other (according to Wet Shark) even if there is another bishop located between them. Now Wet Shark wants to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other.InputThe first line of the input containsn(1 ≤n≤ 200 000) — the number of bishops.Each of nextnlines contains two space separated integersxiandyi(1 ≤xi,yi≤ 1000) — the number of row and the number of column wherei-th bishop is positioned. It's guaranteed that no two bishops share the same position.OutputOutput one integer — the number of pairs of bishops which attack each other.ExamplesInput51 11 53 35 15 5Output6Input31 12 33 5Output0NoteIn the first sample following pairs of bishops attack each other:(1, 3),(1, 5),(2, 3),(2, 4),(3, 4)and(3, 5).
