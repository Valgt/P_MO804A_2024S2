Array Coloringtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to color all its elements in two colors in such a way that the sums of the elements of both colors have the same parity and each color has at least one element colored.For example, if the array is [$$$1,2,4,3,2,3,5,4$$$], we can color it as follows: [$$$\\\\color{blue}{1},\\\\color{blue}{2},\\\\color{red}{4},\\\\color{blue}{3},\\\\color{red}{2},\\\\color{red}{3},\\\\color{red}{5},\\\\color{red}{4}$$$], where the sum of the blue elements is $$$6$$$ and the sum of the red elements is $$$18$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case begins with a line containing an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 50$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to color the array in two colors in such a way that the sums of the elements of both colors have the same parity and each color has at least one element colored, and \"NO\" otherwise.You can output \"Yes\" and \"No\" in any case (for example, the strings \"yES\", \"yes\", and \"Yes\" will be recognized as correct answers).ExampleInput781 2 4 3 2 3 5 424 733 9 821 755 4 3 2 144 3 4 5250 48OutputYES NO YES YES NO YES YESNoteThe first sample is described in the statement.In the second sample, there are only two colorings $$$[\\\\color{blue}{4},\\\\color{red}{7}]$$$ and $$$[\\\\color{red}{4},\\\\color{blue}{7}]$$$ , but in both cases the parity of sums is different.In the third sample, you can color $$$[\\\\color{blue}{3},\\\\color{blue}{9},\\\\color{red}{8}]$$$ and $$$12$$$ and $$$8$$$ are both even.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1ad69ffe", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
