Dora's Settime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDora has a set $$$s$$$ containing integers. In the beginning, she will put all integers in $$$[l, r]$$$ into the set $$$s$$$. That is, an integer $$$x$$$ is initially contained in the set if and only if $$$l \\\\leq x \\\\leq r$$$. Then she allows you to perform the following operations:Select threedistinctintegers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ from the set $$$s$$$, such that $$$\\\\gcd(a, b) = \\\\gcd(b, c) = \\\\gcd(a, c) = 1^\\\\dagger$$$.Then, remove these three integers from the set $$$s$$$.What is the maximum number of operations you can perform?$$$^\\\\dagger$$$Recall that $$$\\\\gcd(x, y)$$$ means thegreatest common divisorof integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the range of integers in the initial set.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of operations you can perform.ExampleInput81 33 710 212 851 602 1510 261 1000Output1 1 3 1 2 3 4 250NoteIn the first test case, you can choose $$$a = 1$$$, $$$b = 2$$$, $$$c = 3$$$ in the only operation, since $$$\\\\gcd(1, 2) = \\\\gcd(2, 3) = \\\\gcd(1, 3) = 1$$$, and then there are no more integers in the set, so no more operations can be performed.In the second test case, you can choose $$$a = 3$$$, $$$b = 5$$$, $$$c = 7$$$ in the only operation.In the third test case, you can choose $$$a = 11$$$, $$$b = 19$$$, $$$c = 20$$$ in the first operation, $$$a = 13$$$, $$$b = 14$$$, $$$c = 15$$$ in the second operation, and $$$a = 10$$$, $$$b = 17$$$, $$$c = 21$$$ in the third operation. After the three operations, the set $$$s$$$ contains the following integers: $$$12$$$, $$$16$$$, $$$18$$$. It can be proven that it's impossible to perform more than $$$3$$$ operations.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "29d8f579", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of integers from  $l$ to $r$ inclusive.
