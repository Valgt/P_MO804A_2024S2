Average Sleep Timetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt's been almost a week since Polycarp couldn't get rid of insomnia. And as you may already know, one week in Berland lastskdays!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the lastndays. So now he has a sequencea1,a2, ...,an, whereaiis the sleep time on thei-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to considerkconsecutive days as a week. So there will ben-k+ 1weeks to take into consideration. For example, ifk= 2,n= 3anda= [3, 4, 7], then the result is.You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.InputThe first line contains two integer numbersnandk(1 ≤k≤n≤ 2·105).The second line containsninteger numbersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 105).OutputOutput average sleeping time over all weeks.The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed10- 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.ExamplesInput3 23 4 7Output9.0000000000Input1 110Output10.0000000000Input8 21 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1Output28964.2857142857NoteIn the third example there aren-k+ 1 = 7weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e52d4abe", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ numbers, where each number represents the number of hours of sleep on a particular day.
