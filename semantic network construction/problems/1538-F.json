Interesting Functiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, where $$$l < r$$$. We will add $$$1$$$ to $$$l$$$ until the result is equal to $$$r$$$. Thus, there will be exactly $$$r-l$$$ additions performed. For each such addition, let's look at the number of digits that will be changed after it.For example:if $$$l=909$$$, then adding one will result in $$$910$$$ and $$$2$$$ digits will be changed;if you add one to $$$l=9$$$, the result will be $$$10$$$ and $$$2$$$ digits will also be changed;if you add one to $$$l=489999$$$, the result will be $$$490000$$$ and $$$5$$$ digits will be changed.Changed digits always form a suffix of the result written in the decimal system.Output the total number of changed digits, if you want to get $$$r$$$ from $$$l$$$, adding $$$1$$$ each time.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case is characterized by two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l < r \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, calculate the total number of changed digits if you want to get $$$r$$$ from $$$l$$$, adding one each time.ExampleInput4 1 9 9 10 10 20 1 1000000000Output8 2 11 1111111110", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "80e613f8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two numbers,  $l$ and $r$, where $l < r$.
