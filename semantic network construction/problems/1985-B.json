The sum of all multiples of $$$2$$$ less than or equal to $$$n$$$ is just $$$2$$$, and the sum of all multiples of $$$3$$$ less than or equal to $$$n$$$ is $$$3$$$. Therefore, $$$3$$$ is the optimal value of $$$x$$$.For $$$n = 15$$$, the optimal value of $$$x$$$ is $$$2$$$. The sum of all multiples of $$$2$$$ less than or equal to $$$n$$$ is $$$2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 = 56$$$, which can be proven to be the maximal over all other possible values of $$$x$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7c9dd5cc", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an integer $n$, find the largest integer $x$ such that $2 \\le x \\le n$.
