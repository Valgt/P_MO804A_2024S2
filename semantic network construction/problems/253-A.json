They should stand in a line so that boys and girls alternated there as much as possible. Let's assume that positions in the line are indexed from left to right by numbers from 1 ton+m. Then the number of integersi(1 ≤i<n+m) such that positions with indexesiandi+ 1contain children of different genders (positionihas a girl and positioni+ 1has a boy or vice versa) must be as large as possible.Help the children and tell them how to form the line.InputThe single line of the input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 100), separated by a space.OutputPrint a line ofn+mcharacters. Print on thei-th position of the line character \"B\", if thei-th position of your arrangement should have a boy and \"G\", if it should have a girl.Of course, the number of characters \"B\" should equalnand the number of characters \"G\" should equalm.
