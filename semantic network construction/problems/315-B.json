Sereja and Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutSereja has got an array, consisting ofnintegers,a1,a2, ...,an. Sereja is an active boy, so he is now going to completemoperations. Each operation will have one of the three forms:Makevi-th array element equal toxi. In other words, perform the assignmentavi=xi.Increase each array element byyi. In other words, performnassignmentsai=ai+yi(1 ≤i≤n).Take a piece of paper and write out theqi-th array element. That is, the elementaqi.Help Sereja, complete all his operations.InputThe first line contains integersn,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 105). The second line containsnspace-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109)— the original array.Nextmlines describe operations, thei-th line describes thei-th operation. The first number in thei-th line is integerti(1 ≤ti≤ 3)that represents the operation type. Ifti= 1, then it is followed by two integersviandxi,(1 ≤vi≤n, 1 ≤xi≤ 109). Ifti= 2, then it is followed by integeryi(1 ≤yi≤ 104). And ifti= 3, then it is followed by integerqi(1 ≤qi≤n).OutputFor each third type operation print valueaqi. Print the values in the order, in which the corresponding queries follow in the input.ExamplesInput10 111 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 103 23 92 103 13 101 1 102 102 103 13 103 9Output291120304039", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "eff9797e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
