Binary Protocoltime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp has just invented a new binary protocol for data transmission. He is encoding positive integer decimal number to binary string using following algorithm:Each digit is represented with number of'1'characters equal to the value of that digit (for0it is zero ones).Digits are written one by one in order corresponding to number and separated by single'0'character.Though Polycarp learnt how to encode the numbers, he has no idea how to decode them back. Help him calculate the decoded number.InputThe first line contains one integer numbern(1 ≤n≤ 89) — length of the strings.The second line contains strings— sequence of'0'and'1'characters, number in its encoded format. It is guaranteed that the number corresponding to the string is positive and doesn't exceed109. The string always starts with'1'.OutputPrint the decoded number.ExamplesInput3111Output3Input9110011101Output2031", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0fd88497", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a binary string representing a positive integer.
