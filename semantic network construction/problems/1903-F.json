Babysittingtime limit per test7 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTheofanis wants to play video games, however he should also take care of his sister. Since Theofanis is a CS major, he found a way to do both. He will install some cameras in his house in order to make sure his sister is okay.His house is an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$m$$$ edges. His sister likes to play at the edges of the graph, so he has to install a camera to at least one endpoint of every edge of the graph. Theofanis wants to find avertex coverthat maximizes the minimum difference between indices of the chosen nodes.More formally, let $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k$$$ be a vertex cover of the graph. Let the minimum difference between indices of the chosen nodes be the minimum $$$\\\\lvert a_i - a_j \\\\rvert$$$ (where $$$i \\\\neq j$$$) out of the nodes that you chose.If $$$k = 1$$$ then we assume that the minimum difference between indices of the chosen nodes is $$$n$$$.Can you find the maximum possible minimum difference between indices of the chosen nodes over all vertex covers?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{5}, 1 \\\\le m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^{5}$$$) — the number of nodes and the number of edges.The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines in the test case contains two positive integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u_i,v_i \\\\le n$$$), meaning that there exists an edge between them in the graph.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^{5}$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^{5}$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the maximum minimum difference between indices of the chosen nodes over all vertex covers.ExampleInput37 61 21 31 41 62 35 73 31 21 31 12 41 21 22 11 1Output2 3 2NoteIn the first test case, we can install cameras at nodes $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, and $$$7$$$, so the answer is $$$2$$$.In the second test case, we can install only one camera at node $$$1$$$, so the answer is $$$3$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "472491a5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an undirected graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges.
