Lucky Numbers (Easy Version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$q=1$$$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.Zookeeper has been teaching his $$$q$$$ sheep how to write and how to add. The $$$i$$$-th sheep has to write exactly $$$k$$$non-negative integerswith the sum $$$n_i$$$.Strangely, sheep have superstitions about digits and believe that the digits $$$3$$$, $$$6$$$, and $$$9$$$ are lucky. To them, the fortune of a number depends on the decimal representation of the number; the fortune of a number is equal to the sum of fortunes of its digits, and the fortune of a digit depends on its value and position and can be described by the following table. For example, the number $$$319$$$ has fortune $$$F_{2} + 3F_{0}$$$.Each sheep wants to maximize thesum of fortuneamong all its $$$k$$$ written integers. Can you help them?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 999999$$$): the number of numbers each sheep has to write.The next line contains six integers $$$F_0$$$, $$$F_1$$$, $$$F_2$$$, $$$F_3$$$, $$$F_4$$$, $$$F_5$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq F_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$): the fortune assigned to each digit.The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$q = 1$$$): the number of sheep.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$n_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n_i \\\\leq 999999$$$): the sum of numbers that $$$i$$$-th sheep has to write. In this version, there is only one line.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines, where the $$$i$$$-th line contains the maximum sum of fortune of all numbers of the $$$i$$$-th sheep. In this version, you should print only one line.ExamplesInput3 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 57Output11Input3 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 63Output8NoteIn the first test case, $$$57 = 9 + 9 + 39$$$. The three $$$9$$$'s contribute $$$1 \\\\cdot 3$$$ and $$$3$$$ at the tens position contributes $$$2 \\\\cdot 1$$$. Hence the sum of fortune is $$$11$$$.In the second test case, $$$63 = 35 + 19 + 9$$$. The sum of fortune is $$$8$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8d2075f5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of fortune values for each digit in a number, depending on its position.  \n\nFor example:\n\n* $F_0$ = fortune of the units digit\n* $F_1$ = fortune of the tens digit\n* $F_2$ = fortune of the hundreds digit\n* and so on...\n\nYou need to determine the maximum sum of fortunes that can be achieved by writing $k$ numbers that add up to a given target sum $n$. \n\n**Input:**\n\n* $k$: The number of numbers to write.\n* $F_0$, $F_1$, $F_2$, $F_3$, $F_4$, $F_5$: The fortune values for each digit position.\n* $n$: The target sum for the $k$ numbers.\n\n**Output:**\n\nThe maximum sum of fortunes achievable."}, {"prompt_md5": "f93d3cd2", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a set of values representing the fortune of each digit in a number based on its position.
