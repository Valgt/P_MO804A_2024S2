Looksery Partytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe Looksery company, consisting ofnstaff members, is planning another big party. Every employee has his phone number and the phone numbers of his friends in the phone book. Everyone who comes to the party, sends messages to his contacts about how cool it is. At the same time everyone is trying to spend as much time on the fun as possible, so they send messages to everyone without special thinking, moreover, each person even sends a messageto himself or herself.Igor and Max, Looksery developers, started a dispute on how many messages each person gets. Igor indicatesnnumbers, thei-th of which indicates how many messages, in his view, thei-th employee is going to take. If Igor guesses correctly at least one of these numbers, he wins, otherwise Max wins.You support Max in this debate, so you need, given the contact lists of the employees, to determine whether there is a situation where Igor loses. Specifically, you need to determine which employees should come to the party, and which should not, so after all the visitors send messages to their contacts, each employee received a number of messages that is different from what Igor stated.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of employees of company Looksery.Nextnlines contain the description of the contact lists of the employees. Thei-th of these lines contains a string of lengthn, consisting of digits zero and one, specifying the contact list of thei-th employee. If thej-th character of thei-th string equals1, then thej-th employee is in thei-th employee's contact list, otherwise he isn't. It is guaranteed that thei-th character of thei-th line is always equal to1.The last line containsnspace-separated integers:a1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤n), whereairepresents the number of messages that thei-th employee should get according to Igor.OutputIn the first line print a single integerm— the number of employees who should come to the party so that Igor loses the dispute.In the second line printmspace-separated integers — the numbers of these employees in an arbitrary order.If Igor wins the dispute in any case, print-1.If there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput31010100010 1 2Output11Input111Output0Input411110101111000011 0 1 0Output41 2 3 4NoteIn the first sample Igor supposes that the first employee will receive0messages. Since he isn't contained in any other contact list he must come to the party in order to receive one message from himself. If he is the only who come to the party then he will receive1message, the second employee will receive0messages and the third will also receive1message. Thereby Igor won't guess any number.In the second sample if the single employee comes to the party he receives1message and Igor wins, so he shouldn't do it.In the third sample the first employee will receive2messages, the second —3, the third —2, the fourth —3.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6578bd54", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ people.
