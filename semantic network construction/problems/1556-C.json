Compressed Bracket Sequencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWilliam has a favorite bracket sequence. Since his favorite sequence is quite big he provided it to you as a sequence of positive integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_n$$$ where $$$c_i$$$ is the number of consecutive brackets \"(\" if $$$i$$$ is an odd number or the number of consecutive brackets \")\" if $$$i$$$ is an even number.For example for a bracket sequence \"((())()))\" a corresponding sequence of numbers is $$$[3, 2, 1, 3]$$$.You need to find the total number of continuous subsequences (subsegments) $$$[l, r]$$$ ($$$l \\\\le r$$$) of the original bracket sequence, which are regular bracket sequences.A bracket sequence is called regular if it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"+\" and \"1\" into this sequence. For example, sequences \"(())()\", \"()\" and \"(()(()))\" are regular, while \")(\", \"(()\" and \"(()))(\" are not.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000)$$$, the size of the compressed sequence.The second line contains a sequence of integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le 10^9)$$$, the compressed sequence.OutputOutput a single integer — the total number of subsegments of the original bracket sequence, which are regular bracket sequences.It can be proved that the answer fits in the signed 64-bit integer data type.ExamplesInput5 4 1 2 3 1Output5Input6 1 3 2 1 2 4Output6Input6 1 1 1 1 2 2Output7NoteIn the first example a sequence(((()(()))(is described.
