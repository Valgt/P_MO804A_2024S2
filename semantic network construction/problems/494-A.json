There was a stringswritten on the door consisting of characters '(', ')' and '#'. Below there was a manual on how to open the door. After spending a long time Malek managed to decode the manual and found out that the goal is to replace each '#' with one or more ')' characters so that the final string becomesbeautiful.Below there was also written that a string is calledbeautifulif for eachi(1 ≤i≤ |s|) there are no more ')' characters than '(' characters among the firsticharacters ofsand also the total number of '(' characters is equal to the total number of ')' characters.Help Malek open the door by telling him for each '#' character how many ')' characters he must replace it with.InputThe first line of the input contains a strings(1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105). Each character of this string is one of the characters '(', ')' or '#'. It is guaranteed thatscontains at least one '#' character.OutputIf there is no way of replacing '#' characters which leads to a beautiful string print- 1. Otherwise for each character '#' print a separate line containing a positive integer, the number of ')' characters this character must be replaced with.If there are several possible answers, you may output any of them.ExamplesInput(((#)((#)Output12Input()((#((#(#()Output221Input#Output-1Input(#)Output-1Note|s|denotes the length of the strings.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d2f66dba", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string consisting of characters '(', ')', and '#'.  \n\nThe goal is to replace each '#' with one or more ')' characters to make the string \"beautiful\". \n\nA string is considered \"beautiful\" if:\n\n* For every position  $i$ (from 1 to the length of the string), there are no more ')' characters than '(' characters before that position.\n* The total number of '(' characters equals the total number of ')' characters in the entire string.\n\nIf it's possible to make the string beautiful, output the number of ')' characters to replace each '#'.
