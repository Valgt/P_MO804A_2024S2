Because of this, whenever a new person moves into the neighborhood, he or she always chooses the house whose minimum distance to any occupied house is maximized. If there are multiple houses with the maximum possible minimum distance, he or she chooses the leftmost one.Note that the first person to arrive always moves into house1.Karen is thek-th person to enter this neighborhood. If everyone, including herself, follows this rule, which house will she move into?InputThe first and only line of input contains two integers,nandk(1 ≤k≤n≤ 1018), describing the number of houses in the neighborhood, and that Karen was thek-th person to move in, respectively.OutputOutput a single integer on a line by itself, the label of the house Karen will move into.ExamplesInput6 4Output2Input39 3Output20NoteIn the first test case, there are6houses in the neighborhood, and Karen is the fourth person to move in:The first person moves into house1.The second person moves into house6.The third person moves into house3.The fourth person moves into house2.In the second test case, there are39houses in the neighborhood, and Karen is the third person to move in:The first person moves into house1.The second person moves into house39.The third person moves into house20.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5ddc74be", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ houses in a line, numbered from 1 to $n$.
