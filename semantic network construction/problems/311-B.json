There's a straight road across the farm andnhills along the road, numbered from 1 tonfrom left to right. The distance between hilliand(i- 1)isdimeters. The feeders live in hill 1.One day, the cats went out to play. Catiwent on a trip to hillhi, finished its trip at timeti, and then waited at hillhifor a feeder. The feeders must take all the cats. Each feeder goes straightly from hill 1 tonwithout waiting at a hill and takes all thewaitingcats at each hill away. Feeders walk at a speed of 1 meter per unit time and are strong enough to take as many cats as they want.For example, suppose we have two hills(d2= 1)and one cat that finished its trip at time 3 at hill 2(h1= 2). Then if the feeder leaves hill 1 at time 2 or at time 3, he can take this cat, but if he leaves hill 1 at time 1 he can't take it. If the feeder leaves hill 1 at time 2, the cat waits him for 0 time units, if the feeder leaves hill 1 at time 3, the cat waits him for 1 time units.Your task is to schedule the time leaving from hill 1 for each feeder so that the sum of the waiting time of all cats is minimized.InputThe first line of the input contains three integersn,m,p(2 ≤n≤ 105, 1 ≤m≤ 105, 1 ≤p≤ 100).The second line containsn- 1positive integersd2,d3, ...,dn(1 ≤di< 104).Each of the nextmlines contains two integershiandti(1 ≤hi≤n, 0 ≤ti≤ 109).OutputOutput an integer, the minimum sum of waiting time of all cats.Please, do not write the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++.
