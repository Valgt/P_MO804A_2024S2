The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 500)$$$ — the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100)$$$ — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 100)$$$ — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, print-1if there is no solution.
