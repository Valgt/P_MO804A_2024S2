Tenzing and Triangletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$pairwise-distinctpoints and a line $$$x+y=k$$$ on a two-dimensional plane. The $$$i$$$-th point is at $$$(x_i,y_i)$$$. All points have non-negative coordinates and are strictly below the line. Alternatively, $$$0 \\\\leq x_i,y_i, x_i+y_i < k$$$.Tenzing wants to erase all the points. He can perform the following two operations:Draw triangle: Tenzing will choose two non-negative integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ that satisfy $$$a+b<k$$$, then all points inside the triangle formed by lines $$$x=a$$$, $$$y=b$$$ and $$$x+y=k$$$ will be erased. It can be shown that this triangle is an isosceles right triangle. Let the side lengths of the triangle be $$$l$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$\\\\sqrt 2 l$$$ respectively. Then, the cost of this operation is $$$l \\\\cdot A$$$.The blue area of the following picture describes the triangle with $$$a=1,b=1$$$ with cost $$$=1\\\\cdot A$$$.Erase a specific point: Tenzing will choose an integer $$$i$$$ that satisfies $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$ and erase the point $$$i$$$. The cost of this operation is $$$c_i$$$.Help Tenzing find the minimum cost to erase all of the points.InputThe first line of the input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$A$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq n,k\\\\leq 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\\\leq A\\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of points, the coefficient describing the hypotenuse of the triangle and the coefficient describing the cost of drawing a triangle.The following $$$n$$$ lines of the input the $$$i$$$-th line contains three integers $$$x_i,y_i,c_i$$$ ($$$0\\\\leq x_i,y_i,x_i+y_i< k$$$, $$$1\\\\leq c_i\\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th points and the cost of erasing it using the second operation. It is guaranteed that the coordinates are pairwise distinct.OutputOutput a single integer —the minimum cost needed to erase all of the points.ExamplesInput4 6 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 3 2 6Output4Input6 7 1 4 2 1 3 3 1 5 1 4 3 2 5 4 1 1 0 6 4Output4Input10 4 100 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 2 50 0 3 200 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 0 200 2 1 200 3 0 200Output355NoteThe picture of the first example:Tenzing do the following operations:draw a triangle with $$$a=3,b=2$$$, the cost $$$=1\\\\cdot A=1$$$.erase the first point, the cost $$$=1$$$.erase the second point, the cost $$$=1$$$.erase the third point, the cost $$$=1$$$.The picture of the second example:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c9c8531e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ points in the first quadrant of a 2D plane.
