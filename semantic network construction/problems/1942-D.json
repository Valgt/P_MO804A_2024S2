Learning to Painttime limit per test4.5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPristine Beat - Touhou⠀Elsie is learning how to paint. She has a canvas of $$$n$$$ cells numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and can paint any (potentially empty) subset of cells.Elsie has a 2D array $$$a$$$ which she will use to evaluate paintings. Let the maximal contiguous intervals of painted cells in a painting be $$$[l_1,r_1],[l_2,r_2],\\\\ldots,[l_x,r_x]$$$. Thebeautyof the painting is the sum of $$$a_{l_i,r_i}$$$ over all $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le x$$$. In the image above, the maximal contiguous intervals of painted cells are $$$[2,4],[6,6],[8,9]$$$ and thebeautyof the painting is $$$a_{2,4}+a_{6,6}+a_{8,9}$$$.There are $$$2^n$$$ ways to paint the strip. Help Elsie find the $$$k$$$ largest possible values of thebeautyof a painting she can obtain, among all these ways. Note that these $$$k$$$ values do not necessarily have to be distinct. It is guaranteed that there are at least $$$k$$$ different ways to paint the canvas.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^3$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq \\\\min(2^n, 5 \\\\cdot 10^3)$$$) — the number of cells and the number of largest values of thebeautyof a painting you must find.The next $$$n$$$ lines of each test case describe $$$a$$$ where the $$$i$$$-th of which contains $$$n-i+1$$$ integers $$$a_{i,i},a_{i,i+1},\\\\ldots,a_{i,n}$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\\\leq a_{i,j} \\\\leq 10^6$$$).It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^3$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^3$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$k$$$ integers in one line: the $$$i$$$-th of them must represent the $$$i$$$-th largest value of thebeautyof a painting Elsie can obtain.ExampleInput41 2-52 42 -3-13 82 4 31 356 200 -6 -3 0 -6 -2-7 -5 -2 -3 -47 0 -9 -42 -1 11 -2-6Output0 -5  2 0 -1 -3  7 5 4 3 3 2 1 0  8 8 7 7 5 5 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 -1NoteIn the first test case, Elsie can either paint the only cell or not paint it.
