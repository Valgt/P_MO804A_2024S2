Gregor and the Odd Cows (Easy)time limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference from the hard version is that in this version all coordinates areeven.There are $$$n$$$ fence-posts at distinct coordinates on a plane. It is guaranteed that no three fence posts lie on the same line.There are an infinite number of cows on the plane, one at every point with integer coordinates.Gregor is a member of the Illuminati, and wants to build a triangular fence, connecting $$$3$$$ distinct existing fence posts. A cowstrictlyinside the fence is said to beenclosed. If there are anoddnumber of enclosed cows and the area of the fence is aninteger, the fence is said to beinteresting.Find the number of interesting fences.InputThe first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 6000$$$), the number of fence posts which Gregor can choose to form the vertices of a fence.Each of the next $$$n$$$ line contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le x,y \\\\le 10^7$$$, $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ areeven), where $$$(x,y)$$$ is the coordinate of a fence post. All fence posts lie at distinct coordinates. No three fence posts are on the same line.OutputPrint a single integer, the number of interesting fences. Two fences are considered different if they are constructed with a different set of three fence posts.ExamplesInput3 0 0 2 0 0 4Output1Input5 0 0 2 16 30 14 4 6 2 10Output3NoteIn the first example, there is only $$$1$$$ fence.
