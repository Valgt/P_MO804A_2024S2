Ring roadtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutNowadays the one-way traffic is introduced all over the world in order to improve driving safety and reduce traffic jams. The government of Berland decided to keep up with new trends. Formerly allncities of Berland were connected byntwo-way roads in the ring, i. e. each city was connected directly to exactly two other cities, and from each city it was possible to get to any other city. Government of Berland introduced one-way traffic on allnroads, but it soon became clear that it's impossible to get from some of the cities to some others. Now for each road is known in which direction the traffic is directed at it, and the cost of redirecting the traffic. What is the smallest amount of money the government should spend on the redirecting of roads so that from every city you can get to any other?InputThe first line contains integern(3 ≤n≤ 100) — amount of cities (and roads) in Berland. Nextnlines contain description of roads. Each road is described by three integersai,bi,ci(1 ≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi, 1 ≤ci≤ 100) — road is directed from cityaito citybi, redirecting the traffic costsci.OutputOutput single integer — the smallest amount of money the government should spend on the redirecting of roads so that from every city you can get to any other.ExamplesInput31 3 11 2 13 2 1Output1Input31 3 11 2 53 2 1Output2Input61 5 45 3 82 4 151 6 162 3 234 6 42Output39Input41 2 92 3 83 4 74 1 5Output0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5881262b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a network of $n$ cities ($3 \\le n \\le 100$) connected by $n$ roads.
