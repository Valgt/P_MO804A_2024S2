Yet Another LCP Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet $$$\\\\text{LCP}(s, t)$$$ be the length of the longest common prefix of strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$. Also let $$$s[x \\\\dots y]$$$ be the substring of $$$s$$$ from index $$$x$$$ to index $$$y$$$ (inclusive). For example, if $$$s = $$$ \"abcde\", then $$$s[1 \\\\dots 3] =$$$ \"abc\", $$$s[2 \\\\dots 5] =$$$ \"bcde\".You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries. Each query is a pair of integer sets $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_k$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_l$$$. Calculate $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i = 1}^{i = k} \\\\sum\\\\limits_{j = 1}^{j = l}{\\\\text{LCP}(s[a_i \\\\dots n], s[b_j \\\\dots n])}$$$ for each query.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$ and the number of queries, respectively.The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters ($$$|s| = n$$$).Next $$$3q$$$ lines contains descriptions of queries — three lines per query. The first line of each query contains two integers $$$k_i$$$ and $$$l_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k_i, l_i \\\\le n$$$) — sizes of sets $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ respectively.The second line of each query contains $$$k_i$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots a_{k_i}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_1 < a_2 < \\\\dots < a_{k_i} \\\\le n$$$) — set $$$a$$$.The third line of each query contains $$$l_i$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots b_{l_i}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_1 < b_2 < \\\\dots < b_{l_i} \\\\le n$$$) — set $$$b$$$.It is guaranteed that $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i = 1}^{i = q}{k_i} \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ and $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i = 1}^{i = q}{l_i} \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ integers — answers for the queries in the same order queries are given in the input.ExampleInput7 4abacaba2 21 21 23 11 2 371 711 2 3 4 5 6 72 21 51 5Output1321216NoteDescription of queries:In the first query $$$s[1 \\\\dots 7] = \\\\text{abacaba}$$$ and $$$s[2 \\\\dots 7] = \\\\text{bacaba}$$$ are considered.
