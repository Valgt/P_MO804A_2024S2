Di-visible Confusiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYouKn0wWho has an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$. He will perform the following operation until the sequence becomes empty: select an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le |a|$$$ and $$$a_i$$$ isnotdivisible by $$$(i + 1)$$$, and erase this element from the sequence. Here $$$|a|$$$ is the length of sequence $$$a$$$ at the moment of operation. Note that the sequence $$$a$$$ changes and the next operation is performed on this changed sequence.For example, if $$$a=[3,5,4,5]$$$, then he can select $$$i = 2$$$, because $$$a_2 = 5$$$ is not divisible by $$$i+1 = 3$$$. After this operation the sequence is $$$[3,4,5]$$$.Help YouKn0wWho determine if it is possible to erase the whole sequence using the aforementioned operation.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10\\\\,000$$$)  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to erase the whole sequence using the aforementioned operation, print \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.
