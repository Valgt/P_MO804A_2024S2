Li Hua and Patterntime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLi Hua has a pattern of size $$$n\\\\times n$$$, each cell is either blue or red. He can performexactly $$$k$$$operations. In each operation, he chooses a cell and changes its color from red to blue or from blue to red. Each cell can be chosen as many times as he wants. Is it possible to make the pattern, that matches its rotation by $$$180^{\\\\circ}$$$?Suppose you were Li Hua, please solve this problem.InputThe first line contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n,k$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 10^3,0\\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the size of the pattern and the number of operations.Each of next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{i,j}$$$ ($$$a_{i,j}\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}$$$) — the initial color of the cell, $$$0$$$ for blue and $$$1$$$ for red.It's guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^3$$$.OutputFor each set of input, print \"YES\" if it's possible to make the pattern, that matches its rotation by $$$180^{\\\\circ}$$$ after applying exactly $$$k$$$ of operations, and \"NO\" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.ExampleInput34 01 1 1 10 0 0 11 0 1 01 1 1 14 31 0 1 11 0 0 00 1 0 11 1 0 15 40 0 0 0 00 1 1 1 10 1 0 0 01 1 1 1 10 0 0 0 0OutputNO YES YESNoteIn test case 1, you can't perform any operation.
