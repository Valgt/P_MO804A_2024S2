Three Pairwise Maximumstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three positive (i.e. strictly greater than zero) integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and $$$z$$$.Your task is to find positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ such that $$$x = \\\\max(a, b)$$$, $$$y = \\\\max(a, c)$$$ and $$$z = \\\\max(b, c)$$$, or determine that it is impossible to find such $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases. Print required $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ in any (arbitrary) order.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x, y, z \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer:\"NO\" in the only line of the output if a solution doesn't exist;or \"YES\" in the first line andanyvalid triple of positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b, c \\\\le 10^9$$$) in the second line. You can print $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$in any order.ExampleInput5 3 2 3 100 100 100 50 49 49 10 30 20 1 1000000000 1000000000OutputYES 3 2 1 YES 100 100 100 NO NO YES 1 1 1000000000", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7ee3cd1b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given three positive integers $x$, $y$, and $z$.
