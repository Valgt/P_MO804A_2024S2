Expected Componentstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven a cyclic array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the value of $$$a$$$ in the $$$i$$$-th position,there may be repeated values. Let us define that a permutation of $$$a$$$ is equal to another permutation of $$$a$$$ if and only if their values are the same for each position $$$i$$$ or we can transform them to each other by performing some cyclic rotation. Let us define for a cyclic array $$$b$$$ its number of components as the number of connected components in a graph, where the vertices are the positions of $$$b$$$ and we add an edge between each pair of adjacent positions of $$$b$$$ with equal values (note that in a cyclic array the first and last position are also adjacents).Find the expected value of components of a permutation of $$$a$$$ if we select it equiprobably over the set of all the different permutations of $$$a$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the size of the cyclic array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers, the $$$i$$$-th of them is the value $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.It is guaranteed that the total number of different permutations of $$$a$$$ is not divisible by $$$M$$$OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the expected value of components of a permutation of $$$a$$$ if we select it equiprobably over the set of all the different permutations of $$$a$$$ modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.Formally, let $$$M = 998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\\\not \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\\\cdot q^{-1} \\\\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\\\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\\\cdot q \\\\equiv p \\\\pmod{M}$$$.ExampleInput541 1 1 141 1 2 141 2 1 254 3 2 5 1121 3 2 3 2 1 3 3 1 3 3 2Output1 2 3 5 358642921NoteIn the first test case there is only $$$1$$$ different permutation of $$$a$$$:$$$[1, 1, 1, 1]$$$ has $$$1$$$ component.Therefore the expected value of components is $$$\\\\frac{1}{1} = 1$$$In the second test case there are $$$4$$$ ways to permute the cyclic array $$$a$$$, but there is only $$$1$$$ different permutation of $$$a$$$:$$$[1, 1, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[1, 1, 2, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 1, 1]$$$ and $$$[2, 1, 1, 1]$$$ are the same permutation and have $$$2$$$ components.Therefore the expected value of components is $$$\\\\frac{2}{1} = 2$$$In the third test case there are $$$6$$$ ways to permute the cyclic array $$$a$$$, but there are only $$$2$$$ different permutations of $$$a$$$:$$$[1, 1, 2, 2]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[2, 2, 1, 1]$$$ and $$$[1, 2, 2, 1]$$$ are the same permutation and have $$$2$$$ components.$$$[1, 2, 1, 2]$$$ and $$$[2, 1, 2, 1]$$$ are the same permutation and have $$$4$$$ components.Therefore the expected value of components is $$$\\\\frac{2+4}{2} = \\\\frac{6}{2} = 3$$$In the fourth test case there are $$$120$$$ ways to permute the cyclic array $$$a$$$, but there are only $$$24$$$ different permutations of $$$a$$$:Any permutation of $$$a$$$ has $$$5$$$ components.Therefore the expected value of components is $$$\\\\frac{24\\\\cdot 5}{24} = \\\\frac{120}{24} = 5$$$", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "311258df", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a circular array of integers,  $a$ of size $n$.
