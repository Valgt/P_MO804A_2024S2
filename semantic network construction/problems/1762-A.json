It can be proved that it is not possible to make $$$a$$$goodin less number of operations.In the third test case, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[0,2,4]$$$ if we perform the operation on index $$$1$$$ once. As $$$[0,2,4]$$$ isgood, answer is $$$1$$$.In the fourth test case, we need to perform the operation on index $$$1$$$ four times. After all operations, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[0]$$$.
