Point Orderingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problem.Khanh has $$$n$$$ points on the Cartesian plane, denoted by $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$. All points' coordinates are integers between $$$-10^9$$$ and $$$10^9$$$, inclusive. No three points are collinear. He says that these points are vertices of a convex polygon; in other words, there exists a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that the polygon $$$a_{p_1} a_{p_2} \\\\ldots a_{p_n}$$$ is convex and vertices are listed in counter-clockwise order.Khanh gives you the number $$$n$$$, but hides the coordinates of his points. Your task is to guess the above permutation by asking multiple queries. In each query, you give Khanh $$$4$$$ integers $$$t$$$, $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$; where either $$$t = 1$$$ or $$$t = 2$$$; and $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ are threedistinctindices from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, inclusive. In response, Khanh tells you:if $$$t = 1$$$, the area of the triangle $$$a_ia_ja_k$$$multiplied by $$$2$$$.if $$$t = 2$$$, thesignof thecross productof twovectors$$$\\\\overrightarrow{a_ia_j}$$$ and $$$\\\\overrightarrow{a_ia_k}$$$.Recall that thecross productof vector $$$\\\\overrightarrow{a} = (x_a, y_a)$$$ and vector $$$\\\\overrightarrow{b} = (x_b, y_b)$$$ is theinteger$$$x_a \\\\cdot y_b - x_b \\\\cdot y_a$$$. Thesignof a number is $$$1$$$ it it is positive, and $$$-1$$$ otherwise. It can be proven that the cross product obtained in the above queries can not be $$$0$$$.You can ask at most $$$3 \\\\cdot n$$$ queries.Please note that Khanh fixes the coordinates of his points and does not change it while answering your queries. You do not need to guess the coordinates. In your permutation $$$a_{p_1}a_{p_2}\\\\ldots a_{p_n}$$$, $$$p_1$$$ should be equal to $$$1$$$ and the indices of vertices should belisted in counter-clockwise order.InteractionYou start the interaction by reading $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1\\\\,000$$$) — the number of vertices.To ask a query, write $$$4$$$ integers $$$t$$$, $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 2$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq i, j, k \\\\leq n$$$) in a separate line. $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ and $$$k$$$ should be distinct.Then read a single integer to get the answer to this query, as explained above. It can be proven that the answer of a query is always an integer.When you find the permutation, write a number $$$0$$$. Then write $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ in the same line.After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will getIdleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:fflush(stdout)orcout.flush()in C++;System.out.flush()in Java;flush(output)in Pascal;stdout.flush()in Python;see documentation for other languages.Hack formatTo hack, use the following format:The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1\\\\,000$$$) — the number of vertices.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the coordinate of the point $$$a_i$$$.ExampleInput6  15  -1  1Output1 1 4 6  2 1 5 6  2 2 1 4  0 1 3 4 2 6 5NoteThe image below shows the hidden polygon in the example:The interaction in the example goes as below:Contestant reads $$$n = 6$$$.Contestant asks a query with $$$t = 1$$$, $$$i = 1$$$, $$$j = 4$$$, $$$k = 6$$$.Jury answers $$$15$$$.

The cross product of $$$\\\\overrightarrow{A_1A_5} = (2, 2)$$$ and $$$\\\\overrightarrow{A_1A_6} = (4, 1)$$$ is $$$-2$$$. The sign of $$$-2$$$ is $$$-1$$$.Contestant asks a query with $$$t = 2$$$, $$$i = 2$$$, $$$j = 1$$$, $$$k = 4$$$.Jury answers $$$1$$$. The cross product of $$$\\\\overrightarrow{A_2A_1} = (-5, 2)$$$ and $$$\\\\overrightarrow{A_2A_4} = (-2, -1)$$$ is $$$1$$$.
