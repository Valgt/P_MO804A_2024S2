Sum Over Zerotime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. Consider $$$S$$$ as a set of segments satisfying the following conditions.Each element of $$$S$$$ should be in form $$$[x, y]$$$, where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive, and $$$x \\\\leq y$$$.No two segments in $$$S$$$ intersect with each other. Two segments $$$[a, b]$$$ and $$$[c, d]$$$ intersect if and only if there exists an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$a \\\\leq x \\\\leq b$$$ and $$$c \\\\leq x \\\\leq d$$$.For each $$$[x, y]$$$ in $$$S$$$, $$$a_x+a_{x+1}+ \\\\ldots +a_y \\\\geq 0$$$.The length of the segment $$$[x, y]$$$ is defined as $$$y-x+1$$$. $$$f(S)$$$ is defined as the sum of the lengths of every element in $$$S$$$. In a formal way, $$$f(S) = \\\\sum_{[x, y] \\\\in S} (y - x + 1)$$$.

Since every possible $$$S$$$ satisfies $$$f(S) \\\\leq 9$$$, the answer is $$$9$$$.In the third example, $$$S$$$ can only be an empty set, so the answer is $$$0$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8d63b7bf", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.  \n\nYou need to find the maximum sum of lengths of non-overlapping segments within the array that satisfy the following condition:\n\n* For each segment $[x, y]$, the sum of the elements in the array from index $x$ to $y$ (inclusive) is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nThe length of a segment $[x, y]$ is defined as $y - x + 1$. \n\nOutput the maximum possible sum of lengths of all segments that satisfy the given conditions."}, {"prompt_md5": "9493a3ff", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers.
