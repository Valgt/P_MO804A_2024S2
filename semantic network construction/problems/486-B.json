We can define logicalORof three or more logical values in the same manner:whereis equal to1if someai= 1, otherwise it is equal to0.Nam has a matrixAconsisting ofmrows andncolumns. The rows are numbered from1tom, columns are numbered from1ton. Element at rowi(1 ≤i≤m) and columnj(1 ≤j≤n) is denoted asAij. All elements ofAare either 0 or 1. From matrixA, Nam creates another matrixBof the same size using formula:.(BijisORof all elements in rowiand columnjof matrixA)Nam gives you matrixBand challenges you to guess matrixA. Although Nam is smart, he could probably make a mistake while calculating matrixB, since size ofAcan be large.InputThe first line contains two integermandn(1 ≤m,n≤ 100), number of rows and number of columns of matrices respectively.The nextmlines each containnintegers separated by spaces describing rows of matrixB(each element ofBis either0or1).OutputIn the first line, print \"NO\" if Nam has made a mistake when calculatingB, otherwise print \"YES\". If the first line is \"YES\", then also printmrows consisting ofnintegers representing matrixAthat can produce given matrixB. If there are several solutions print any one.ExamplesInput2 21 00 0OutputNOInput2 31 1 11 1 1OutputYES1 1 11 1 1Input2 30 1 01 1 1OutputYES0 0 00 1 0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6d3c3bc7", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a matrix $B$ of size $m \\times n$ where each element $B_{ij}$ is the result of performing a logical OR operation on all elements in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of a matrix $A$ of the same size.  \n\nDetermine if it is possible to find a matrix $A$ that produces the given matrix $B$.
