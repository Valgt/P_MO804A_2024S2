Unfortunately, no customer has ever bought any mythical detail, so all the details produced stay on the factory.The board of directors are worried that the production by the given plan may eventually stop (that means that there will be а moment when the current number of details on the factory is divisible bym).Given the number of detailsaon the first day and numbermcheck if the production stops at some moment.InputThe first line contains two integersaandm(1 ≤a,m≤ 105).OutputPrint \"Yes\" (without quotes) if the production will eventually stop, otherwise print \"No\".ExamplesInput1 5OutputNoInput3 6OutputYes", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2b877f1e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given two integers $a$ and $m$ (where $1 \\le a, m \\le 10^5$), determine if a production process will eventually stop.\n\nThe process starts with $a$ items.
