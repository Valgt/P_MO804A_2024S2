Unfortunately, he does not remember the exact amount of his deputies, but he remembers that the desk of each his deputy is adjacent to his own desk, that is to say, the two desks (President's and each deputy's) have a common side of a positive length.The office-room plan can be viewed as a matrix withnrows andmcolumns. Each cell of this matrix is either empty, or contains a part of a desk. An uppercase Latin letter stands for each desk colour.
