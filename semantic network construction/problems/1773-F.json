They have a hypothesis that there is a correlation between the number of draws and fans' desire to watch football matches in the future.In football, two teams play a match. The teams score goals throughout a match. A score \"$$$x$$$:$$$y$$$\" means that the team we observe scored $$$x$$$ goals and conceded $$$y$$$ goals. If $$$x = y$$$, then the match ends in a draw. If $$$x > y$$$, then the observed team wins, and if $$$x < y$$$, then it loses.To find out if there is a correlation, the scientists gathered information about the results of teams in lower leagues. The information they found is the number of matches played by the team ($$$n$$$), the number of goals scored in these matches ($$$a$$$), and the number of goals conceded in these matches ($$$b$$$).You are given this information for a single team. You are asked to calculate the minimum number of draws that could have happened during the team's matches and provide a list of match scores with the minimum number of draws.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ — the number of matches played by the team ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$). The second line contains an integer $$$a$$$ — the total number of goals scored by the team in all $$$n$$$ matches ($$$0 \\\\le a \\\\le 1000$$$). The third line contains an integer $$$b$$$ — the total number of goals conceded by the team in all $$$n$$$ matches ($$$0 \\\\le b \\\\le 1000$$$).OutputIn the first line, print a single integer $$$d$$$ — the minimum number of draws.In the following $$$n$$$ lines, print a list of match scores, each line in the format \"$$$x$$$:$$$y$$$\", where $$$x$$$ is the number of goals scored in the match, and $$$y$$$ – the number of goals conceded, so that exactly $$$d$$$ of these matches have ended in a draw. In case multiple such lists of match scores exist, print any of them.ExamplesInput3 2 4Output0 1:0 1:2 0:2Input1 2 2Output1 2:2Input4 0 7Output0 0:1 0:2 0:1 0:3Input6 3 1Output2 0:0 1:0 0:0 0:1 1:0 1:0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4560b5fe", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given the number of matches played by a team ($n$), the total goals scored ($a$), and the total goals conceded ($b$).
