Michael and Charging Stationstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMichael has just bought a new electric car for moving across city. Michael does not like to overwork, so each day he drives to only one of two his jobs.Michael's day starts from charging his electric car for getting to the work and back. He spends1000burles on charge if he goes to the first job, and2000burles if he goes to the second job.On a charging station he uses there is a loyalty program that involves bonus cards. Bonus card may have some non-negative amount of bonus burles. Each time customer is going to buy something for the price ofxburles, he is allowed to pay an amount ofy(0 ≤y≤x) burles that does not exceed the bonus card balance with bonus burles. In this case he paysx-yburles with cash, and the balance on the bonus card is decreased byybonus burles.If customer pays whole price with cash (i.e.,y= 0) then 10% of price is returned back to the bonus card. This means that bonus card balance increases bybonus burles. Initially the bonus card balance is equal to 0 bonus burles.Michael has planned nextndays and he knows how much does the charge cost on each of those days. Help Michael determine the minimum amount of burles in cash he has to spend with optimal use of bonus card. Assume that Michael is able to cover any part of the price with cash in any day. It is not necessary to spend all bonus burles at the end of the given period.InputThe first line of input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 300 000), the number of days Michael has planned.Next line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(ai= 1000orai= 2000) withaidenoting the charging cost at the dayi.OutputOutput the minimum amount of burles Michael has to spend.ExamplesInput31000 2000 1000Output3700Input62000 2000 2000 2000 2000 1000Output10000NoteIn the first sample case the most optimal way for Michael is to pay for the first two days spending 3000 burles and get 300 bonus burles as return. After that he is able to pay only 700 burles for the third days, covering the rest of the price with bonus burles.In the second sample case the most optimal way for Michael is to pay the whole price for the first five days, getting 1000 bonus burles as return and being able to use them on the last day without paying anything in cash.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "dd17ded3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ days.
