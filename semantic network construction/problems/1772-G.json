Gaining Ratingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp is playing chess on one popular website. He has $$$n$$$ opponents he can play with. The $$$i$$$-th opponent has rating equal to $$$a_i$$$. Monocarp's initial rating is $$$x$$$. Monocarp wants to raise his rating to the value $$$y$$$ ($$$y > x$$$).When Monocarp is playing against one of the opponents, he will win if hiscurrentrating is bigger or equal to the opponent's rating. If Monocarp wins, his rating is increased by $$$1$$$, otherwise it is decreased by $$$1$$$. The rating of his opponent does not change.Monocarp wants to gain rating $$$y$$$ playing as few games as possible. But he can't just grind it, playing against weak opponents. The website has a rule that you should play against all opponents as evenly as possible. Speaking formally, if Monocarp wants to play against an opponent $$$i$$$, there should be no other opponent $$$j$$$ such that Monocarp has played more games against $$$i$$$ than against $$$j$$$.Calculate the minimum possible number of games Monocarp needs to gain rating $$$y$$$ or say it's impossible. Note that ratings of Monocarp's opponentsdon'tchange, while Monocarp's rating does change.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\le x < y \\\\le 10^{12}$$$) — the number of Monocarp's opponents, his initial and desired ratings.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^{12}$$$) — ratings of Monocarp's opponents.Additional constraint on the input: the total sum of $$$n$$$ over all $$$t$$$ test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of games Monocarp needs to play to gain rating $$$y$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if it's impossible.ExampleInput37 2 103 1 9 2 5 20 87 1 103 1 9 2 5 20 85 10 12100 1 200 11 300Output20 -1 2NoteIn the first test case, Monocarp can use the following strategy:Monocarp plays against the $$$2$$$-nd opponent to increase rating ($$$2 \\\\to 3$$$);Monocarp plays against the $$$1$$$-st opponent to increase rating ($$$3 \\\\to 4$$$);Monocarp plays against the $$$4$$$-th opponent to increase rating ($$$4 \\\\to 5$$$);Monocarp plays against the $$$5$$$-th opponent to increase rating ($$$5 \\\\to 6$$$);Now Monocarp have to play with remaining three opponents. So, he will lose $$$3$$$ times and get rating $$$3$$$ ($$$6 \\\\to 5 \\\\to 4 \\\\to 3$$$);After that, Monocarp will repeat steps 1-5 again. After $$$14$$$ games, he has played twice with each opponent and get final rating $$$4$$$.Monocarp plays against the $$$1$$$-st opponent to increase rating ($$$4 \\\\to 5$$$);Monocarp plays against the $$$2$$$-nd opponent to increase rating ($$$5 \\\\to 6$$$);Monocarp plays against the $$$4$$$-th opponent to increase rating ($$$6 \\\\to 7$$$);Monocarp plays against the $$$5$$$-th opponent to increase rating ($$$7 \\\\to 8$$$);Monocarp plays against the $$$7$$$-th opponent to increase rating ($$$8 \\\\to 9$$$);Monocarp plays against the $$$3$$$-rd opponent to increase rating ($$$9 \\\\to 10$$$);In total, Monocarp, played twice against the $$$6$$$-th opponent and three times against other opponents and got rating $$$10$$$ in $$$14 + 6 = 20$$$ games.In the second test case, it can be proven that whichever games Monocarp plays, he can't get his rating higher than $$$4$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "18dda660", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ opponents, each with a rating $a_i$.
