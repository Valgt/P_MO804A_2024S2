During a day your customers want to buy strings of certain lengths and sometimes satisfying other properties.Today your first customer asked you if you have a string of length $$$k$$$. In fact, you have a string of length $$$n$$$ and can cut a string of length $$$k$$$ starting at any position out of it. You wonder how many distinct values this string can equal.Please note that in your shop strings are over an alphabet of size $$$2$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq k\\\\leq n\\\\leq 200\\\\,000$$$). The second line contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.OutputIn the only line print the number of distinct substrings of length $$$k$$$ of the string $$$s$$$.ExamplesInput5 2 01101Output3Input10 3 1110001011Output8NoteThe second sample test represents the de Bruijn sequence of order 3.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "95805082", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a binary string $s$ of length $n$.
