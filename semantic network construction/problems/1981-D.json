Turtle and Multiplicationtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTurtle just learned how to multiply two integers in his math class, and he was very excited.Then Piggy gave him an integer $$$n$$$, and asked him to construct a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ consisting of integers which satisfied the following conditions:For all $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$, $$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.For all $$$1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n - 1$$$, $$$a_i \\\\cdot a_{i + 1} \\\\ne a_j \\\\cdot a_{j + 1}$$$.Of all such sequences, Piggy asked Turtle to find the one with theminimumnumber ofdistinctelements.Turtle definitely could not solve the problem, so please help him!InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the length of the sequence $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ — the elements of the sequence $$$a$$$.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExampleInput3234Output114514 114514 1 2 2 3 3 4 4NoteIn the third test case, $$$a = [3, 4, 2, 6]$$$ violates the second condition since $$$a_1 \\\\cdot a_2 = a_3 \\\\cdot a_4$$$. $$$a = [2, 3, 4, 4]$$$ satisfy the conditions but its number of distinct elements isn't minimum.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ad6c3e70", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an integer $n$, find a sequence of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n*  $1 \\le a_i \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$ for all $i$\n*  $a_i \\cdot a_{i+1} \\neq a_j \\cdot a_{j+1}$ for all $1 \\le i < j \\le n-1$\n\nThe goal is to find a sequence with the minimum number of distinct elements."}, {"prompt_md5": "8cbd9913", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number *n*, create a sequence of *n* numbers between 1 and 300,000 where no two consecutive numbers multiply to equal any other two consecutive numbers in the sequence.
