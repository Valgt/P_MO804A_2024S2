His mom, of course, wants to give him as beautiful an array as possible (with largest possible beauty). Unfortunately, the shop has only one arrayaleft. On the plus side, the seller said that he could decrease some numbers in the array (no more than bykfor each number).The seller can obtain arraybfrom arrayaif the following conditions hold:bi> 0; 0 ≤ai-bi≤kfor all1 ≤i≤n.Help mom find the maximum possible beauty of the array she will give to Vasya (that seller can obtain).InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 3·105; 1 ≤k≤ 106).
