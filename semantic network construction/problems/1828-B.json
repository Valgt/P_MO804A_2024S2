Permutation Swaptime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given anunsortedpermutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$. To sort the permutation, you choose a constant $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\\\ge 1$$$) and do some operations on the permutation. In one operation, you can choose two integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le j < i \\\\le n$$$) such that $$$i - j = k$$$, then swap $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$.What is themaximumvalue of $$$k$$$ that you can choose to sort the given permutation?A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2, 3, 1, 5, 4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1, 2, 2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1, 3, 4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n = 3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).An unsorted permutation $$$p$$$ is a permutation such that there is at least one position $$$i$$$ that satisfies $$$p_i \\\\ne i$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{5}$$$) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$) — the permutation $$$p$$$. It is guaranteed that the given numbers form a permutation of length $$$n$$$ and the given permutation isunsorted.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^{5}$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the maximum value of $$$k$$$ that you can choose to sort the given permutation.We can show that an answer always exists.ExampleInput733 1 243 4 1 274 2 6 7 5 3 191 6 7 4 9 2 3 8 561 5 3 4 2 6103 10 5 2 9 6 7 8 1 4111 11 6 4 8 3 7 5 9 10 2Output1 2 3 4 3 2 3NoteIn the first test case, the maximum value of $$$k$$$ you can choose is $$$1$$$.
