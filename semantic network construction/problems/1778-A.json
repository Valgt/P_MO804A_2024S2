Flip Flop Sumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$. The integers are either $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$. You have to perform the following operationexactly onceon the array $$$a$$$:Choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i < n$$$) and flip the signs of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$. Here, flipping the sign means $$$-1$$$ will be $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ will be $$$-1$$$.What is the maximum possible value of $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\\\ldots + a_n$$$ after applying the above operation?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 500$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$), the length of the array $$$a$$$.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i = 1$$$ or $$$a_i = -1$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the maximum possible sum of the array $$$a$$$ you can get in a separate line.ExampleInput45-1 1 1 -1 -151 1 -1 -1 -121 141 -1 -1 1Output3 3 -2 4NoteIn the first case, we can choose index $$$4$$$ and flip the signs of $$$a_4$$$ and $$$a_5$$$. After this operation, the sum will be $$$-1+1+1+1+1 = 3$$$. We can't make the sum larger than this.In the third case, the only option is to choose the index $$$1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0185d70c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, where each integer is either 1 or -1.
