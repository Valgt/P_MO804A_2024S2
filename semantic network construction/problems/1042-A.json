Benchestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ benches in the Berland Central park. It is known that $$$a_i$$$ people are currently sitting on the $$$i$$$-th bench. Another $$$m$$$ people are coming to the park and each of them is going to have a seat on some bench out of $$$n$$$ available.Let $$$k$$$ be the maximum number of people sitting on one bench after additional $$$m$$$ people came to the park. Calculate the minimum possible $$$k$$$ and the maximum possible $$$k$$$.Nobody leaves the taken seat during the whole process.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100)$$$ — the number of benches in the park.The second line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le m \\\\le 10\\\\,000)$$$ — the number of people additionally coming to the park.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$a_i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 100)$$$ — the initial number of people on the $$$i$$$-th bench.OutputPrint the minimum possible $$$k$$$ and the maximum possible $$$k$$$, where $$$k$$$ is the maximum number of people sitting on one bench after additional $$$m$$$ people came to the park.ExamplesInput461111Output3 7Input1105Output15 15Input36165Output6 12Input37165Output7 13NoteIn the first example, each of four benches is occupied by a single person. The minimum $$$k$$$ is $$$3$$$. For example, it is possible to achieve if two newcomers occupy the first bench, one occupies the second bench, one occupies the third bench, and two remaining — the fourth bench. The maximum $$$k$$$ is $$$7$$$. That requires all six new people to occupy the same bench.The second example has its minimum $$$k$$$ equal to $$$15$$$ and maximum $$$k$$$ equal to $$$15$$$, as there is just a single bench in the park and all $$$10$$$ people will occupy it.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d171c28c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ benches in a park.
