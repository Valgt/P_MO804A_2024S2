Jeff and Digitstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutJeff's gotncards, each card contains either digit 0, or digit 5. Jeff can choose several cards and put them in a line so that he gets some number. What is the largest possible number divisible by 90 Jeff can make from the cards he's got?Jeff must make the number without leading zero. At that, we assume that number 0 doesn't contain any leading zeroes. Jeff doesn't have to use all the cards.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 103). The next line containsnintegersa1,a2,...,an(ai= 0orai= 5). Numberairepresents the digit that is written on thei-th card.OutputIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum number, divisible by 90. If you can't make any divisible by 90 number from the cards, print -1.ExamplesInput45 0 5 0Output0Input115 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5Output5555555550NoteIn the first test you can make only one number that is a multiple of 90 —0.In the second test you can make number5555555550, it is a multiple of90.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b50806c1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of cards, each containing either a 0 or a 5.
