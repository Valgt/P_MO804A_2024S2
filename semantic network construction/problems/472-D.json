Design Tutorial: Inverse the Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThere is an easy way to obtain a new task from an old one called \"Inverse the problem\": we give an output of the original task, and ask to generate an input, such that solution to the original problem will produce the output we provided. The hard task of Topcoder Open 2014 Round 2C, InverseRMQ, is a good example.Now let's create a task this way. We will use the task: you are given a tree, please calculate the distance between any pair of its nodes. Yes, it is very easy, but the inverse version is a bit harder: you are given ann×ndistance matrix. Determine if it is the distance matrix of a weighted tree (all weights must be positive integers).InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 2000) — the number of nodes in that graph.Then nextnlines each containsnintegersdi,j(0 ≤di,j≤ 109) — the distance between nodeiand nodej.OutputIf there exists such a tree, output \"YES\", otherwise output \"NO\".ExamplesInput30 2 72 0 97 9 0OutputYESInput31 2 72 0 97 9 0OutputNOInput30 2 27 0 97 9 0OutputNOInput30 1 11 0 11 1 0OutputNOInput20 00 0OutputNONoteIn the first example, the required tree exists. It has one edge between nodes 1 and 2 with weight 2, another edge between nodes 1 and 3 with weight 7.In the second example, it is impossible becaused1, 1should be 0, but it is 1.In the third example, it is impossible becaused1, 2should equald2, 1.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6e4d283c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a square matrix of size $n \\times n$ where each cell $d_{i,j}$ represents the distance between node $i$ and node $j$.  \n\nDetermine if this matrix represents the distance matrix of a weighted tree (a tree where all edge weights are positive integers).\n\n**Input:**\n\n* The first line contains an integer $n$ (1 ≤ $n$ ≤ 2000) representing the number of nodes.\n* The next $n$ lines each contain $n$ integers $d_{i,j}$ (0 ≤ $d_{i,j}$ ≤ 10⁹) representing the distance between node $i$ and node $j$.\n\n**Output:**\n\n* If a tree exists with the given distances, output \"YES\".\n* Otherwise, output \"NO\"."}, {"prompt_md5": "2760d94d", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a square grid of numbers representing distances between points.
