The first number 4 has exactly three divisors — 1, 2 and 4, thus the answer for this number is \"YES\". The second number 5 has two divisors (1 and 5), and the third number 6 has four divisors (1, 2, 3, 6), hence the answer for them is \"NO\".", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c298b6b4", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers.
