Removing Smallest Multiplestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a set $$$S$$$, which contains the first $$$n$$$ positive integers: $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, n$$$.You can perform the following operation on $$$S$$$ any number of times (possibly zero):Choose a positive integer $$$k$$$ where $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$, such that there exists a multiple of $$$k$$$ in $$$S$$$. Then, delete thesmallestmultiple of $$$k$$$ from $$$S$$$. This operation requires a cost of $$$k$$$.You are given a set $$$T$$$, which is a subset of $$$S$$$. Find the minimum possible total cost of operations such that $$$S$$$ would be transformed into $$$T$$$. We can show that such a transformation is always possible.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line contains a single positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^6$$$).The second line of each test case contains a binary string of length $$$n$$$, describing the set $$$T$$$. The $$$i$$$-th character of the string is '1' if and only if $$$i$$$ is an element of $$$T$$$, and '0' otherwise.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one non-negative integer — the minimum possible total cost of operations such that $$$S$$$ would be transformed into $$$T$$$.ExampleInput6611111171101001400004001081001010115110011100101100Output0 11 4 4 17 60NoteIn the first test case, we shall not perform any operations as $$$S$$$ is already equal to $$$T$$$, which is the set $$$\\\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\\\}$$$.In the second test case, initially, $$$S = \\\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\\\}$$$, and $$$T = \\\\{1, 2, 4, 7\\\\}$$$.
