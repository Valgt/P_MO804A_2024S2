Mex Mastertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Thescoreof $$$a$$$ is the MEX$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$ of $$$[a_1+a_2,a_2+a_3,\\\\ldots,a_{n-1}+a_n]$$$. Find the minimum score of $$$a$$$ if you are allowed to rearrange elements of $$$a$$$ in any order. Note that you arenot requiredto construct the array $$$a$$$ that achieves the minimum score.$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$ The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:The MEX of $$$[2,2,1]$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the array.The MEX of $$$[3,1,0,1]$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the array, but $$$2$$$ does not.The MEX of $$$[0,3,1,2]$$$ is $$$4$$$ because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$ belong to the array, but $$$4$$$ does not.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\\\le n\\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum score of $$$a$$$ after rearranging the elements of $$$a$$$ in any order.ExampleInput320 030 0 181 0 0 0 2 0 3 0Output1 0 1NoteIn the first test case, it is optimal to rearrange $$$a$$$ as $$$[0,0]$$$, the score of this array is the MEX of $$$[0+0]=[0]$$$, which is $$$1$$$.In the second test case, it is optimal to rearrange $$$a$$$ as $$$[0,1,0]$$$, the score of this array is the MEX of $$$[0+1,1+0]=[1,1]$$$, which is $$$0$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "dff331b0", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, $a = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]$.  \n\nCalculate the minimum possible MEX value of the array  $[a_1 + a_2, a_2 + a_3, ..., a_{n-1} + a_n]$.  \n\nThe MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.\n\nYou can rearrange the elements of the array $a$ in any order. \n\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum possible MEX value."}, {"prompt_md5": "110d1850", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers.
