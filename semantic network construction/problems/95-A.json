Hockeytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutPetya loves hockey very much. One day, as he was watching a hockey match, he fell asleep. Petya dreamt of being appointed to change a hockey team's name. Thus, Petya was given the original team namewand the collection of forbidden substringss1,s2, ...,sn. All those strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. Stringwhas the length of|w|, its characters are numbered from1to|w|.First Petya should find all the occurrences of forbidden substrings in thewstring. During the search of substrings the case of letter shouldn't be taken into consideration. That is, strings \"aBC\" and \"ABc\" are considered equal.After that Petya should perform the replacement of all letters covered by the occurrences. More formally: a letter in the positionishould be replaced by any other one if for positioniin stringwthere exist pair of indicesl,r(1 ≤l≤i≤r≤ |w|) such that substringw[l...r]is contained in the collections1,s2, ...,sn, when using case insensitive comparison. During the replacement the letter's case should remain the same. Petya is not allowed to replace the letters that aren't covered by any forbidden substring.Letterletter(uppercase or lowercase) is considered lucky for the hockey players. That's why Petya should perform the changes so that theletteroccurred in the resulting string as many times as possible. Help Petya to find such resulting string. If there are several such strings, find the one that comes first lexicographically.Note that the process of replacements is not repeated, it occurs only once. That is, if after Petya's replacements the string started to contain new occurrences of bad substrings, Petya pays no attention to them.InputThe first line contains the only integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of forbidden substrings in the collection. Nextnlines contain these substrings. The next line contains stringw. All thosen+ 1lines are non-empty strings consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters whose length does not exceed100. The last line contains a lowercase letterletter.OutputOutput the only line — Petya's resulting string with the maximum number of lettersletter. If there are several answers then output the one that comes first lexicographically.The lexicographical comparison is performed by the standard < operator in modern programming languages. The lineais lexicographically smaller than the lineb, ifais a prefix ofb, or there exists such ani(1 ≤i≤ |a|), thatai<bi, and for anyj(1 ≤j<i)aj=bj.|a|stands for the length of stringa.ExamplesInput3bersuckyeluPetrLoveLuckyNumberstOutputPetrLovtTttttNumttttInput4hellopartyabefglghjdhfgjIVanpetrsmatchwinaOutputpetrsmatchwinInput2aCacbaabAcabacOutputabCacba", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5bc0fa60", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string $w$ and a collection of forbidden substrings $s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$.  \n\n1.
