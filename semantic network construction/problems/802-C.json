Heidi and Library (hard)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe good times at Heidi's library are over. Marmots finally got their internet connections and stopped coming to the library altogether. Not only that, but the bookstore has begun charging extortionate prices for some books. Namely, whereas in the previous versions each book could be bought for 1 CHF, now the price of bookiisciCHF.InputThe first line of input will contain two integersnandk(). The second line will containnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤n) – the sequence of book requests. The third line containsnintegersc1,c2, ...,cn(0 ≤ci≤ 106) – the costs of the books.OutputOn a single line print the minimum cost of buying books at the store so as to satisfy all requests.ExamplesInput4 801 2 2 11 1 1 1Output2Input4 11 2 2 11 1 1 1Output3Input4 21 2 3 11 1 1 1Output3Input7 21 2 3 1 1 1 21 10 1 0 0 0 0Output13NoteThe first three sample cases are repeated, but the fourth one is new.In the fourth test case, when buying book3, Heidi should discard either book1or2.
