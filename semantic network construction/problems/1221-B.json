Initially all cells of the board are empty, and you have to put a white or a black knight into each cell of the board.A knight is a chess piece that can attack a piece in cell ($$$x_2$$$, $$$y_2$$$) from the cell ($$$x_1$$$, $$$y_1$$$) if one of the following conditions is met:$$$|x_1 - x_2| = 2$$$ and $$$|y_1 - y_2| = 1$$$, or$$$|x_1 - x_2| = 1$$$ and $$$|y_1 - y_2| = 2$$$.Here are some examples of which cells knight can attack. In each of the following pictures, if the knight is currently in the blue cell, it can attack all red cells (and only them).Aduel of knightsis a pair of knights ofdifferentcolors such that these knights attack each other. You have to put a knight (a white one or a black one) into each cell in such a way that the number of duels is maximum possible.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) â€” the number of rows (and columns) in the board.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ lines with $$$n$$$ characters in each line. The $$$j$$$-th character in the $$$i$$$-th line should beW, if the cell ($$$i$$$, $$$j$$$) contains a white knight, orB, if it contains a black knight. The number of duels should be maximum possible.
