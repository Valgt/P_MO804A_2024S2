Tavas and SaDDastime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOnce again Tavas started eating coffee mix without water! Keione told him that it smells awful, but he didn't stop doing that. That's why Keione told his smart friend, SaDDas to punish him! SaDDas took Tavas' headphones and told him: \"If you solve the following problem, I'll return it to you.\"The problem is:You are given alucky numbern.Lucky numbersare the positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers47,744,4are lucky and5,17,467are not.If we sort all lucky numbers in increasing order, what's the 1-based index ofn?Tavas is not as smart as SaDDas, so he asked you to do him a favor and solve this problem so he can have his headphones back.InputThe first and only line of input contains a lucky numbern(1 ≤n≤ 109).OutputPrint the index ofnamong all lucky numbers.ExamplesInput4Output1Input7Output2Input77Output6", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "693c3bc2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a positive integer $n$.
