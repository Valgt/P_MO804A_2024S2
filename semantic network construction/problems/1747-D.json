You can apply the following operation to the subarray any number of times (possibly zero)-Choose two integers $$$L$$$, $$$R$$$ such that $$$l \\\\le L \\\\le R \\\\le r$$$ and $$$R - L + 1$$$ isodd.Replace each element in the subarray from $$$L$$$ to $$$R$$$ with theXORof the elements in the subarray $$$[L, R]$$$.The answer to the query is the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the subarray $$$a[l:r]$$$ equal to $$$0$$$ or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to make all of them equal to $$$0$$$.You can find more details aboutXORoperationhere.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n, q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5)$$$  — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(0 \\\\le a_i \\\\lt 2^{30})$$$  — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le n)$$$  — the description of the $$$i$$$-th query.OutputFor each query, output a single integer  — the answer to that query.ExampleInput7 6 3 0 3 3 1 2 3 3 4 4 6 3 7 5 6 1 6 2 2Output-1 1 1 -1 2 0NoteIn thefirst query, $$$l = 3, r = 4$$$, subarray = $$$[3, 3]$$$. We can apply operation only to the subarrays of length $$$1$$$, which won't change the array; hence it is impossible to make all elements equal to $$$0$$$.In thesecond query, $$$l = 4, r = 6$$$, subarray = $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$. We can choose the whole subarray $$$(L = 4, R = 6)$$$ and replace all elements by their XOR $$$(3 \\\\oplus 1 \\\\oplus 2) = 0$$$, making the subarray $$$[0, 0, 0]$$$.In thefifth query, $$$l = 1, r = 6$$$, subarray = $$$[3, 0, 3, 3, 1, 2]$$$. We can make the operations as follows:Choose $$$L = 4, R = 6$$$, making the subarray $$$[3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]$$$.Choose $$$L = 1, R = 5$$$, making the subarray $$$[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d0e2d786", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
