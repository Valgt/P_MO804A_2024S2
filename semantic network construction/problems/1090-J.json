Two Prefixestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMisha didn't do his math homework for today's lesson once again. As a punishment, his teacher Dr. Andrew decided to give him a hard, but very useless task.Dr. Andrew has written two stringssandtof lowercase English letters at the blackboard. He reminded Misha thatprefixof a string is a string formed by removing several (possibly none) of its last characters, and aconcatenationof two strings is a string formed by appending the second string to the right of the first string.The teacher asked Misha to write down on the blackboard all strings that are the concatenations of some non-empty prefix ofsand some non-empty prefix oft. When Misha did it, Dr. Andrew asked him how many distinct strings are there. Misha spent almost the entire lesson doing that and completed the task.Now he asks you to write a program that would do this task automatically.InputThe first line contains the stringsconsisting of lowercase English letters. The second line contains the stringtconsisting of lowercase English letters.The lengths of both string do not exceed105.OutputOutput a single integer — the number of distinct strings that are concatenations of some non-empty prefix ofswith some non-empty prefix oft.ExamplesInputabaaaOutput5InputaaaaaaaaaOutput8NoteIn the first example, the stringshas three non-empty prefixes: {a,ab,aba}. The stringthas two non-empty prefixes: {a,aa}. In total, Misha has written five distinct strings: {aa,aaa,aba,abaa,abaaa}. The stringabaahas been written twice.In the second example, Misha has written eight distinct strings: {aa,aaa,aaaa,aaaaa,aaaaaa,aaaaaaa,aaaaaaaa,aaaaaaaaa}.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c9fe00c8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two strings, $s$ and $t$.
