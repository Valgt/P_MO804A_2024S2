Lucky Chainstime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's name a pair of positive integers $$$(x, y)$$$luckyif the greatest common divisor of them is equal to $$$1$$$ ($$$\\\\gcd(x, y) = 1$$$).Let's define achaininduced by $$$(x, y)$$$ as a sequence of pairs $$$(x, y)$$$, $$$(x + 1, y + 1)$$$, $$$(x + 2, y + 2)$$$, $$$\\\\dots$$$, $$$(x + k, y + k)$$$ for some integer $$$k \\\\ge 0$$$. Thelengthof the chain is the number of pairs it consists of, or $$$(k + 1)$$$.Let's name such chainluckyif all pairs in the chain are lucky.You are given $$$n$$$ pairs $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$. Calculate for each pair the length of the longest lucky chain induced by this pair. Note that if $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ is not lucky itself, the chain will have the length $$$0$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the number of pairs.Next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$n$$$ pairs — one per line. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i < y_i \\\\le 10^7$$$) — the corresponding pair.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th integer is the length of the longest lucky chain induced by $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ or $$$-1$$$ if the chain can be infinitely long.ExampleInput4 5 15 13 37 8 9 10009 20000Output0 1 -1 79NoteIn the first test case, $$$\\\\gcd(5, 15) = 5 > 1$$$, so it's already not lucky, so the length of the lucky chain is $$$0$$$.In the second test case, $$$\\\\gcd(13 + 1, 37 + 1) = \\\\gcd(14, 38) = 2$$$.
