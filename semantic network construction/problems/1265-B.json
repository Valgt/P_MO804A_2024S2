Beautiful Numberstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a permutation $$$p=[p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n]$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Let's call the number $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le n$$$)beautiful, if there exists two indices $$$l, r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$), such that the numbers $$$[p_l, p_{l+1}, \\\\ldots, p_r]$$$ is a permutation of numbers $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, m$$$.For example, let $$$p = [4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6]$$$. In this case, the numbers $$$1, 3, 5, 6$$$ are beautiful and $$$2, 4$$$ are not. It is because:if $$$l = 3$$$ and $$$r = 3$$$ we will have a permutation $$$[1]$$$ for $$$m = 1$$$;if $$$l = 3$$$ and $$$r = 5$$$ we will have a permutation $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$ for $$$m = 3$$$;if $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 5$$$ we will have a permutation $$$[4, 5, 1, 3, 2]$$$ for $$$m = 5$$$;if $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 6$$$ we will have a permutation $$$[4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6]$$$ for $$$m = 6$$$;it is impossible to take some $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, such that $$$[p_l, p_{l+1}, \\\\ldots, p_r]$$$ is a permutation of numbers $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, m$$$ for $$$m = 2$$$ and for $$$m = 4$$$.You are given a permutation $$$p=[p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n]$$$. For all $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le n$$$) determine if it is a beautiful number or not.InputThe first line contains the only integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$)  — the number of test cases in the input. The next lines contain the description of test cases.The first line of a test case contains a number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the given permutation $$$p$$$. The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$, all $$$p_i$$$ are different) — the given permutation $$$p$$$.It is guaranteed, that the sum of $$$n$$$ from all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines — the answers to test cases in the order they are given in the input.The answer to a test case is the string of length $$$n$$$, there the $$$i$$$-th character is equal to $$$1$$$ if $$$i$$$ is a beautiful number and is equal to $$$0$$$ if $$$i$$$ is not a beautiful number.ExampleInput3 6 4 5 1 3 2 6 5 5 3 1 2 4 4 1 4 3 2Output101011 11111 1001NoteThe first test case is described in the problem statement.In the second test case all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$5$$$ are beautiful:if $$$l = 3$$$ and $$$r = 3$$$ we will have a permutation $$$[1]$$$ for $$$m = 1$$$;if $$$l = 3$$$ and $$$r = 4$$$ we will have a permutation $$$[1, 2]$$$ for $$$m = 2$$$;if $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 4$$$ we will have a permutation $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$ for $$$m = 3$$$;if $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 5$$$ we will have a permutation $$$[3, 1, 2, 4]$$$ for $$$m = 4$$$;if $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 5$$$ we will have a permutation $$$[5, 3, 1, 2, 4]$$$ for $$$m = 5$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a284ba3a", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers.
