You have to find the maximum length of a subarray consisting of equal values across all arrays $$$c$$$ that could be obtained.$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ A merge of two arrays results in an array $$$c$$$ composed by successively taking the first element of either array (as long as that array is nonempty) and removing it. After this step, the element is appended to the back of $$$c$$$. We repeat this operation as long as we can (i.e. at least one array is nonempty).InputEach test contains multiple test cases.
