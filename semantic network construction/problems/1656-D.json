K-goodtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWe say that a positive integer $$$n$$$ is $$$k$$$-good for some positive integer $$$k$$$ if $$$n$$$ can be expressed as a sum of $$$k$$$ positive integers which give $$$k$$$ distinct remainders when divided by $$$k$$$.Given a positive integer $$$n$$$, find some $$$k \\\\geq 2$$$ so that $$$n$$$ is $$$k$$$-good or tell that such a $$$k$$$ does not exist.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line with an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$).OutputFor each test case, print a line with a value of $$$k$$$ such that $$$n$$$ is $$$k$$$-good ($$$k \\\\geq 2$$$), or $$$-1$$$ if $$$n$$$ is not $$$k$$$-good for any $$$k$$$. If there are multiple valid values of $$$k$$$, you can print any of them.ExampleInput5 2 4 6 15 20Output-1 -1 3 3 5Note$$$6$$$ is a $$$3$$$-good number since it can be expressed as a sum of $$$3$$$ numbers which give different remainders when divided by $$$3$$$: $$$6 = 1 + 2 + 3$$$.$$$15$$$ is also a $$$3$$$-good number since $$$15 = 1 + 5 + 9$$$ and $$$1, 5, 9$$$ give different remainders when divided by $$$3$$$.$$$20$$$ is a $$$5$$$-good number since $$$20 = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6$$$ and $$$2,3,4,5,6$$$ give different remainders when divided by $$$5$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b423caa2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a positive integer $n$, find the smallest integer $k \\ge 2$ such that $n$ can be expressed as the sum of $k$ positive integers that leave distinct remainders when divided by $k$.
