Makoto and a Blackboardtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMakoto has a big blackboard with a positive integer $$$n$$$ written on it. He will perform the following action exactly $$$k$$$ times:Suppose the number currently written on the blackboard is $$$v$$$. He will randomly pick one of the divisors of $$$v$$$ (possibly $$$1$$$ and $$$v$$$) and replace $$$v$$$ with this divisor. As Makoto uses his famous random number generator (RNG) and as he always uses $$$58$$$ as his generator seed, each divisor is guaranteed to be chosen with equal probability.He now wonders what is the expected value of the number written on the blackboard after $$$k$$$ steps.It can be shown that this value can be represented as $$$\\\\frac{P}{Q}$$$ where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are coprime integers and $$$Q \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{10^9+7}$$$. Print the value of $$$P \\\\cdot Q^{-1}$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputThe only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^{15}$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 10^4$$$).OutputPrint a single integer — the expected value of the number on the blackboard after $$$k$$$ steps as $$$P \\\\cdot Q^{-1} \\\\pmod{10^9+7}$$$ for $$$P$$$, $$$Q$$$ defined above.ExamplesInput6 1Output3Input6 2Output875000008Input60 5Output237178099NoteIn the first example, after one step, the number written on the blackboard is $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ or $$$6$$$ — each occurring with equal probability. Hence, the answer is $$$\\\\frac{1+2+3+6}{4}=3$$$.In the second example, the answer is equal to $$$1 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{9}{16}+2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{3}{16}+3 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{3}{16}+6 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{16}=\\\\frac{15}{8}$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "316198b4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a positive integer $n$ and a number $k$.  \n\nA process is performed $k$ times:\n\n1.
