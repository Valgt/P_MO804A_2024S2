Max Plus Min Plus Sizetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEnV - The Dusty Dragon Tavern⠀You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ of positive integers.You can color some elements of the array red, but there cannot be two adjacent red elements (i.e., for $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n-1$$$, at least one of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$ must not be red).Your score is the maximum value of a red element, plus the minimum value of a red element, plus the number of red elements. Find the maximum score you can get.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the given array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible score you can get after coloring some elements red according to the statement.ExampleInput435 4 534 5 4103 3 3 3 4 1 2 3 5 41017 89 92 42 29 41 92 14 70 45Output12 11 12 186NoteIn the first test case, you can color the array as follows: $$$[\\\\color{red}{5}, 4, \\\\color{red}{5}]$$$. Your score is $$$\\\\max([5, 5]) + \\\\min([5, 5]) + \\\\text{size}([5, 5]) = 5+5+2 = 12$$$. This is the maximum score you can get.In the second test case, you can color the array as follows: $$$[4, \\\\color{red}{5}, 4]$$$. Your score is $$$\\\\max([5]) + \\\\min([5]) + \\\\text{size}([5]) = 5+5+1 = 11$$$. This is the maximum score you can get.In the third test case, you can color the array as follows: $$$[\\\\color{red}{3}, 3, \\\\color{red}{3}, 3, \\\\color{red}{4}, 1, 2, \\\\color{red}{3}, 5, \\\\color{red}{4}]$$$. Your score is $$$\\\\max([3, 3, 4, 3, 4]) + \\\\min([3, 3, 4, 3, 4]) + \\\\text{size}([3, 3, 4, 3, 4]) = 4+3+5 = 12$$$.
