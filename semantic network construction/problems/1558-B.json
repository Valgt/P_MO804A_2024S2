Up the Striptime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test128 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNote that the memory limit in this problem is lower than in others.You have a vertical strip with $$$n$$$ cells, numbered consecutively from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from top to bottom.You also have a token that is initially placed in cell $$$n$$$. You will move the token up until it arrives at cell $$$1$$$.Let the token be in cell $$$x > 1$$$ at some moment. One shift of the token can have either of the following kinds:Subtraction: you choose an integer $$$y$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$x-1$$$, inclusive, and move the token from cell $$$x$$$ to cell $$$x - y$$$.Floored division: you choose an integer $$$z$$$ between $$$2$$$ and $$$x$$$, inclusive, and move the token from cell $$$x$$$ to cell $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{x}{z} \\\\rfloor$$$ ($$$x$$$ divided by $$$z$$$ rounded down).Find the number of ways to move the token from cell $$$n$$$ to cell $$$1$$$ using one or more shifts, and print it modulo $$$m$$$. Note that if there are several ways to move the token from one cell to another in one shift, all these ways are considereddistinct(check example explanation for a better understanding).InputThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 4 \\\\cdot 10^6$$$; $$$10^8 < m < 10^9$$$; $$$m$$$ is a prime number) — the length of the strip and the modulo.OutputPrint the number of ways to move the token from cell $$$n$$$ to cell $$$1$$$, modulo $$$m$$$.ExamplesInput3 998244353Output5Input5 998244353Output25Input42 998244353Output793019428Input787788 100000007Output94810539NoteIn the first test, there are three ways to move the token from cell $$$3$$$ to cell $$$1$$$ in one shift: using subtraction of $$$y = 2$$$, or using division by $$$z = 2$$$ or $$$z = 3$$$.There are also two ways to move the token from cell $$$3$$$ to cell $$$1$$$ via cell $$$2$$$: first subtract $$$y = 1$$$, and then either subtract $$$y = 1$$$ again or divide by $$$z = 2$$$.Therefore, there are five ways in total.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "32982a9d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have a vertical strip with $n$ cells, numbered from 1 to $n$ from top to bottom.
