Arkady and Rectanglestime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputArkady has got an infinite plane painted in color $$$0$$$. Then he draws $$$n$$$ rectangles filled with paint with sides parallel to the Cartesian coordinate axes, one after another. The color of the $$$i$$$-th rectangle is $$$i$$$ (rectangles are enumerated from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in the order he draws them).
