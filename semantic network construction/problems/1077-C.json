Good Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call an arraygoodif there is an element in the array that equals to the sum of all other elements. For example, the array $$$a=[1, 3, 3, 7]$$$ is good because there is the element $$$a_4=7$$$ which equals to the sum $$$1 + 3 + 3$$$.You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. Your task is to print all indices $$$j$$$ of this array such that after removing the $$$j$$$-th element from the array it will begood(let's call such indicesnice).For example, if $$$a=[8, 3, 5, 2]$$$, theniceindices are $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$:if you remove $$$a_1$$$, the array will look like $$$[3, 5, 2]$$$ and it isgood;if you remove $$$a_4$$$, the array will look like $$$[8, 3, 5]$$$ and it isgood.You have to consider all removalsindependently, i. e. remove the element, check if the resulting array isgood, and return the element into the array.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputIn the first line print one integer $$$k$$$ — the number of indices $$$j$$$ of the array $$$a$$$ such that after removing the $$$j$$$-th element from the array it will begood(i.e. print the number of theniceindices).In the second line print $$$k$$$ distinct integers $$$j_1, j_2, \\\\dots, j_k$$$ inanyorder —niceindices of the array $$$a$$$.If there are no such indices in the array $$$a$$$, just print $$$0$$$ in the first line and leave the second line empty or do not print it at all.ExamplesInput5 2 5 1 2 2Output3 4 1 5Input4 8 3 5 2Output2 1 4Input5 2 1 2 4 3Output0NoteIn the first example you can remove any element with the value $$$2$$$ so the array will look like $$$[5, 1, 2, 2]$$$. The sum of this array is $$$10$$$ and there is an element equals to the sum of remaining elements ($$$5 = 1 + 2 + 2$$$).In the second example you can remove $$$8$$$ so the array will look like $$$[3, 5, 2]$$$. The sum of this array is $$$10$$$ and there is an element equals to the sum of remaining elements ($$$5 = 3 + 2$$$). You can also remove $$$2$$$ so the array will look like $$$[8, 3, 5]$$$. The sum of this array is $$$16$$$ and there is an element equals to the sum of remaining elements ($$$8 = 3 + 5$$$).In the third example you cannot make the given arraygoodby removing exactly one element.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6abc500c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
