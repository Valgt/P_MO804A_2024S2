Flow Controltime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRaj has a single physical network line that connects his office to the Internet. This line bandwidth is $$$b$$$ bytes per millisecond.There are $$$n$$$ users who would like to use this network line to transmit some data. The $$$i$$$-th of them will use the line from millisecond $$$s_i$$$ to millisecond $$$f_i$$$ inclusive. His initial data rate will be set to $$$d_i$$$. That means he will use data rate equal to $$$d_i$$$ for millisecond $$$s_i$$$, and then it will change according to the procedure described below.The flow control will happen as follows. Suppose there are $$$m$$$ users trying to transmit some data via the given network line during millisecond $$$x$$$. Denote as $$$t_i$$$ the data rate that the $$$i$$$-th of these $$$m$$$ users has at the beginning of this millisecond. All $$$t_i$$$ are non-negative integer values.If $$$m = 0$$$, i. e. there are no users trying to transmit data during this millisecond, nothing happens.If the sum of all $$$t_i$$$ is less than or equal to $$$b$$$, each active user successfully completes his transmission (the $$$i$$$-th active user transmits $$$t_i$$$ bytes). After that, the data rate of each active user grows by $$$1$$$, i. e. each $$$t_i$$$ is increased by $$$1$$$.If the sum of all $$$t_i$$$ is greater than $$$b$$$, the congestion occurs and no data transmissions succeed this millisecond at all. If that happens, each $$$t_i$$$ decreases twice, i. e. each $$$t_i$$$ is replaced with $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{t_i}{2} \\\\rfloor$$$.Raj knows all the values $$$n$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$s_i$$$, $$$f_i$$$, and $$$d_i$$$, he wants to calculate the total number of bytes transmitted by all the users in the aggregate.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq b \\\\leq 10^9$$$), the number of users who will use the line and the line bandwidth, respectively.Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$s_i$$$, $$$f_i$$$ and $$$d_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq s_i \\\\leq f_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq d_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$), denoting that the $$$i$$$-th user will try to transmit data during each millisecond between $$$s_i$$$ and $$$f_i$$$ inclusive, and the initial data rate of the $$$i$$$-th user.OutputPrint one integer — the total number of bytes all users will successfully transmit.ExamplesInput1 3 1 5 2Output10Input1 10 7 11 1000Output0Input2 6 1 12 1 8 20 3Output64Input3 10 1 100 1 30 60 20 40 80 6Output534NoteConsider the first example.Millisecond $$$1$$$: User $$$1$$$ transmits $$$2$$$ bytes.Millisecond $$$2$$$: User $$$1$$$ transmits $$$3$$$ bytes.Millisecond $$$3$$$: Congestion occurs, and no user transmits data.Millisecond $$$4$$$: User $$$1$$$ transmits $$$2$$$ bytes.Millisecond $$$5$$$: User $$$1$$$ transmits $$$3$$$ bytes.In the second example, at each millisecond from the $$$7$$$-th to the $$$11$$$-th inclusive, congestion occurs, and the only user decreases their rate twice.
