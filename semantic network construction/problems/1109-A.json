Sasha and a Bit of Relaxtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSasha likes programming. Once, during a very long contest, Sasha decided that he was a bit tired and needed to relax. So he did. But since Sasha isn't an ordinary guy, he prefers to relax unusually. During leisure time Sasha likes to upsolve unsolved problems because upsolving is very useful.Therefore, Sasha decided to upsolve the following problem:You have an array $$$a$$$ with $$$n$$$ integers. You need to count the number offunnypairs $$$(l, r)$$$ $$$(l \\\\leq r)$$$. To check if a pair $$$(l, r)$$$ is afunnypair, take $$$mid = \\\\frac{l + r - 1}{2}$$$, then if $$$r - l + 1$$$ is anevennumber and $$$a_l \\\\oplus a_{l+1} \\\\oplus \\\\ldots \\\\oplus a_{mid} = a_{mid + 1} \\\\oplus a_{mid + 2} \\\\oplus \\\\ldots \\\\oplus a_r$$$, then the pair isfunny. In other words, $$$\\\\oplus$$$ of elements of the left half of the subarray from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ should be equal to $$$\\\\oplus$$$ of elements of the right half. Note that $$$\\\\oplus$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operation.It is time to continue solving the contest, so Sasha asked you to solve this task.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i < 2^{20}$$$) — array itself.OutputPrint one integer — the number offunnypairs. You should consider only pairs where $$$r - l + 1$$$ is even number.ExamplesInput51 2 3 4 5Output1Input63 2 2 3 7 6Output3Input342 4 2Output0NoteBe as cool as Sasha, upsolve problems!In the first example, the onlyfunnypair is $$$(2, 5)$$$, as $$$2 \\\\oplus 3 = 4 \\\\oplus 5 = 1$$$.In the second example, funny pairs are $$$(2, 3)$$$, $$$(1, 4)$$$, and $$$(3, 6)$$$.In the third example, there are nofunnypairs.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0235ec7b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
