Nezzar and Symmetric Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLong time ago there was a symmetric array $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_{2n}$$$ consisting of $$$2n$$$distinct integers. Array $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_{2n}$$$ is called symmetric if for each integer $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le 2n$$$, there exists an integer $$$1 \\\\le j \\\\le 2n$$$ such that $$$a_i = -a_j$$$.For each integer $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le 2n$$$, Nezzar wrote down an integer $$$d_i$$$ equal to the sum of absolute differences from $$$a_i$$$ to all integers in $$$a$$$, i. e. $$$d_i = \\\\sum_{j = 1}^{2n} {|a_i - a_j|}$$$.Now a million years has passed and Nezzar can barely remember the array $$$d$$$ and totally forget $$$a$$$. Nezzar wonders if there exists any symmetric array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$2n$$$ distinct integers that generates the array $$$d$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\\\ldots, d_{2n}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le d_i \\\\le 10^{12}$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print \"YES\" in a single line if there exists a possible array $$$a$$$. Otherwise, print \"NO\".You can print letters in any case (upper or lower).ExampleInput6 2 8 12 8 12 2 7 7 9 11 2 7 11 7 11 1 1 1 4 40 56 48 40 80 56 80 48 6 240 154 210 162 174 154 186 240 174 186 162 210OutputYES NO NO NO NO YESNoteIn the first test case, $$$a=[1,-3,-1,3]$$$ is one possible symmetric array that generates the array $$$d=[8,12,8,12]$$$.In the second test case, it can be shown that there is no symmetric array consisting of distinct integers that can generate array $$$d$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "cace652b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array $d$ of $2n$ integers.
