Least Producttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):Choose any element $$$a_i$$$ from the array and change its value to any integer between $$$0$$$ and $$$a_i$$$ (inclusive). More formally, if $$$a_i < 0$$$, replace $$$a_i$$$ with any integer in $$$[a_i, 0]$$$, otherwise replace $$$a_i$$$ with any integer in $$$[0, a_i]$$$.Let $$$r$$$ be the minimum possible product of all the $$$a_i$$$ after performing the operation any number of times.Find the minimum number of operations required to make the product equal to $$$r$$$. Also, print one such shortest sequence of operations. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 500$$$) - the number of test cases. This is followed by their description.The first line of each test case contains the a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$$$) â€” the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case:The first line must contain the minimum number of operations $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n$$$).The $$$j$$$-th of the next $$$k$$$ lines must contain two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$, which represent the $$$j$$$-th operation. That operation consists in replacing $$$a_i$$$ with $$$x$$$.ExampleInput4 1 155 4 2 8 -1 3 4 -1 0 -2 -5 4 -15 -75 -25 -30Output1 1 0 0 0 1 3 0NoteIn the first test case, we can change the value of the first integer into $$$0$$$ and the product will become $$$0$$$, which is the minimum possible.In the second test case, initially, the product of integers is equal to $$$2 \\\\cdot 8 \\\\cdot (-1) \\\\cdot 3 = -48$$$ which is the minimum possible, so we should do nothing in this case.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f9a90b5f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
