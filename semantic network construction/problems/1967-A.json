Permutation Countingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have some cards. An integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ is written on each card: specifically, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, you have $$$a_i$$$ cards which have the number $$$i$$$ written on them.There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have $$$k$$$ coins, so you can buy $$$k$$$ new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain any integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$.After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length $$$n$$$ which are a permutation of $$$[1, 2, \\\\ldots, n]$$$. What's the maximum score you can get?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t\\\\ (1\\\\le t\\\\le 100)$$$. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0\\\\le k \\\\le 10^{12}$$$) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^{12}$$$) — the number of cards of type $$$i$$$ you have at the beginning.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum score you can get.ExampleInput81 1012 48 43 46 1 83 97 6 25 36 6 7 4 69 77 6 1 7 6 2 4 3 310 101 3 1 2 1 9 3 5 7 59 85 8 7 5 1 3 2 9 8Output11 15 15 22 28 32 28 36NoteIn the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is $$$[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$ (including $$$11$$$ single $$$1$$$s), which contains $$$11$$$ subarrays consisting of a permutation of $$$[1]$$$.In the second test case, we can buy $$$0$$$ cards of type $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ cards of type $$$2$$$, and then we rearrange the cards as following: $$$[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]$$$. There are $$$8$$$ subarrays equal to $$$[1, 2]$$$ and $$$7$$$ subarrays equal to $$$[2, 1]$$$, which make a total of $$$15$$$ subarrays which are a permutation of $$$[1, 2]$$$. It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is $$$[3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1275433e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have $n$ types of cards, with $a_i$ cards of type $i$ initially.
