Consecutive Sumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ with $$$n$$$ integers. You can perform the following operation at most $$$k$$$ times:Choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, in which $$$i \\\\,\\\\bmod\\\\, k = j \\\\,\\\\bmod\\\\, k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n$$$).Swap $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$.After performing all operations, you have to select $$$k$$$ consecutive elements, and the sum of the $$$k$$$ elements becomes your score. Find the maximum score you can get.Here $$$x \\\\bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 600$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the length of the array and the number in the statement above.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$)  — the array itself.OutputFor each test case, print the maximum score you can get, one per line.ExampleInput53 25 6 01 175 37 0 4 0 44 22 7 3 43 31000000000 1000000000 999999997Output11 7 15 10 2999999997NoteIn the first test case, we can get a score of $$$11$$$ if we select $$$a_1, a_2$$$ without performing any operations.In the third test case, we can get a score of $$$15$$$ if we first swap $$$a_1$$$ with $$$a_4$$$ and then select $$$a_3, a_4, a_5$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a0f492d0", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
