Unfortunately, if there is more than one Microsoft employee in night club, level of coolness goes infinitely high and party is over, so club owners will never let more than one Microsoft employee enter their club in the same week (just to be sure).You are organizing night life for Microsoft employees and you have statistics about how much every employee likes Friday and Saturday parties for all clubs.You need to match people with clubs maximizing overall sum of their happiness (they are happy as much as they like the club), whilehalfof people should go clubbing on Friday and the otherhalfon Saturday.InputThe first line contains integerN— number of employees in MDCS.Then anN×Nmatrix follows, where element ini-th row andj-th column is an integer number that represents how muchi-th person likesj-th club’sFridayparty.Then anotherN×Nmatrix follows, where element ini-th row andj-th column is an integer number that represents how muchi-th person likesj-th club’sSaturdayparty.2 ≤N≤ 20Nis even0 ≤level of likeness≤ 106All values are integersOutputOutput should contain a single integer — maximum sum of happiness possible.ExamplesInput41 2 3 42 3 4 13 4 1 24 1 2 35 8 7 16 9 81 355 78 1 61 1 1 1Output167NoteHere is how we matched people with clubs:Friday: 1st person with 4th club (4 happiness) and 4th person with 1st club (4 happiness).Saturday: 2nd person with 3rd club (81 happiness) and 3rd person with 2nd club (78 happiness).4+4+81+78 = 167", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8bc96f7c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $N$ people and $N$ clubs.
