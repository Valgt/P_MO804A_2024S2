Triangular numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutA triangular number is the number of dots in an equilateral triangle uniformly filled with dots. For example, three dots can be arranged in a triangle; thus three is a triangular number. Then-th triangular number is the number of dots in a triangle withndots on a side.. You can learn more about these numbers from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number).Your task is to find out if a given integer is a triangular number.InputThe first line contains the single numbern(1 ≤n≤ 500) — the given integer.OutputIf the given integer is a triangular number outputYES, otherwise outputNO.ExamplesInput1OutputYESInput2OutputNOInput3OutputYES", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e9641d8a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Determine if a given integer is a triangular number.\n\nA triangular number is a number that can be represented as the sum of consecutive natural numbers.
