Prefix Removalstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet. You must perform the following algorithm on $$$s$$$:Let $$$x$$$ be the length of the longest prefix of $$$s$$$ which occurs somewhere else in $$$s$$$ as a contiguous substring (the other occurrence may also intersect the prefix). If $$$x = 0$$$, break. Otherwise, remove the first $$$x$$$ characters of $$$s$$$, and repeat.A prefix is a string consisting of several first letters of a given string, without any reorders. An empty prefix is also a valid prefix. For example, the string \"abcd\" has 5 prefixes: empty string, \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\" and \"abcd\".For instance, if we perform the algorithm on $$$s =$$$ \"abcabdc\",Initially, \"ab\" is the longest prefix that also appears somewhere else as a substring in $$$s$$$, so $$$s =$$$ \"cabdc\" after $$$1$$$ operation.Then, \"c\" is the longest prefix that also appears somewhere else as a substring in $$$s$$$, so $$$s =$$$ \"abdc\" after $$$2$$$ operations.Now $$$x=0$$$ (because there are no non-empty prefixes of \"abdc\" that also appear somewhere else as a substring in $$$s$$$), so the algorithm terminates.Find the final state of the string after performing the algorithm.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases.This is followed by $$$t$$$ lines, each containing a description of one test case. Each line contains a string $$$s$$$. The given strings consist only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet and have lengths between $$$1$$$ and $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ inclusive.It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of $$$s$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single line containing the string $$$s$$$ after executing the algorithm. It can be shown that such string is non-empty.ExampleInput6abcabdcabbbbbbbbbbcodeforcescffcfccffccfcffcfccfcffccffcfccfzyzyzwxxyyxxyyzzyzzxxwzxwywxwzxxyzzwOutputabdc a b deforces cf xyzzwNoteThe first test case is explained in the statement.In the second test case, no operations can be performed on $$$s$$$.In the third test case,Initially, $$$s =$$$ \"bbbbbbbbbb\".After $$$1$$$ operation, $$$s =$$$ \"b\".In the fourth test case,Initially, $$$s =$$$ \"codeforces\".After $$$1$$$ operation, $$$s =$$$ \"odeforces\".After $$$2$$$ operations, $$$s =$$$ \"deforces\".", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b4af15f5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string $s$.
