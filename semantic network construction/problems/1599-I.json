Deserttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an undirected graph of $$$N$$$ nodes and $$$M$$$ edges, $$$E_1, E_2, \\\\dots E_M$$$.A connected graph is a cactus if each of it's edges belogs to at most one simple cycle. A graph is a desert if each of it's connected components is a cactus.Find the number of pairs $$$(L, R)$$$, ($$$1 \\\\leq L \\\\leq R \\\\leq M$$$) such that, if we delete all the edges except for $$$E_L, E_{L+1}, \\\\dots E_R$$$, the graph is a desert.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$N$$$ and $$$M$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 2.5 \\\\times 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq M \\\\leq 5 \\\\times 10^5$$$). Each of the next $$$M$$$ lines contains two integers. The $$$i$$$-th line describes the $$$i$$$-th edge. It contains integers $$$U_i$$$ and $$$V_i$$$, the nodes connected by the $$$i$$$-th edge ($$$E_i=(U_i, V_i)$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$1 \\\\leq U_i, V_i \\\\leq N$$$ and $$$U_i \\\\neq V_i$$$.OutputThe output contains one integer number â€“ the answer.ExamplesInput5 6 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 1 2 4Output20Input2 3 1 2 1 2 1 2Output5NoteIn the second example: Graphs for pairs $$$(1, 1)$$$, $$$(2, 2)$$$ and $$$(3, 3)$$$ are deserts because they don't have any cycles.
