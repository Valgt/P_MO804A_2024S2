The screen that should be presenting her with the description of the next code looks almost like the previous one, though who would have thought that the evil Empire engineers would fill this small screen with several million digits! It is just ridiculous to think that anyone would read them all...Heidi is once again given a sequenceAand two integerskandp.

We define thescoreofXto be the sum of the elements ofXmodulop.Heidi is given a sequenceAthat consists ofNintegers, and also given integerskandp. Her goal is to splitAintokparts such that:Each part contains at least1element ofA, and each part consists of contiguous elements ofA.No two parts overlap.The total sumSof the scores of those parts isminimized(not maximized!).Output the sumS, which is the encryption code.InputThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integersN,kandp(k≤N≤ 500 000,2 ≤k≤ 100,2 ≤p≤ 100) – the number of elements inA, the number of partsAshould be split into, and the modulo for computing scores, respectively.The second line containsNspace-separated integers that are the elements ofA. Each integer is from the interval[1, 1 000 000].OutputOutput the numberSas described in the problem statement.ExamplesInput4 3 103 4 7 2Output6Input10 5 1216 3 24 13 9 8 7 5 12 12Output13NoteIn the first example, if the input sequence is split as(3),(4, 7),(2), the total score would be.
