Jatayu's Balanced Bracket Sequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLast summer, Feluda gifted Lalmohan-Babu abalancedbracket sequence $$$s$$$ of length $$$2 n$$$.Topshe was bored during his summer vacations, and hence he decided to draw an undirected graph of $$$2 n$$$ vertices using thebalanced bracket sequence$$$s$$$. For any two distinct vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le 2 n$$$), Topshe draws an edge (undirected and unweighted) between these two nodes if and only if thesubsegment$$$s[i \\\\ldots j]$$$ forms a balanced bracket sequence.Determine the number ofconnected componentsin Topshe's graph.See the Notes section for definitions of the underlined terms.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of opening brackets in string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$2 n$$$ — a balanced bracket sequence consisting of $$$n$$$ opening brackets \"(\", and $$$n$$$ closing brackets \")\".It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of connected components in Topshe's graph.ExampleInput41()3()(())3((()))4(())(())Output1 2 3 3NoteSample explanation:In the first test case, the graph constructed from the bracket sequence(), is just a graph containing nodes $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ connected by a single edge.In the second test case, the graph constructed from the bracket sequence()(())would be the following (containing two connected components):Definition of Underlined Terms:A sequence of brackets is called balanced if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters $$$+$$$ and $$$1$$$.
