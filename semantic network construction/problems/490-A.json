The school teachers decided that the teams will be composed of three children that are good at different subjects. That is, each team must have one mathematician, one programmer and one sportsman. Of course, each child can be a member of no more than one team.What is the maximum number of teams that the school will be able to present at the Olympiad? How should the teams be formed for that?InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 5000) — the number of children in the school. The second line containsnintegerst1,t2, ...,tn(1 ≤ti≤ 3), wheretidescribes the skill of thei-th child.OutputIn the first line output integerw— the largest possible number of teams.Then printwlines, containing three numbers in each line. Each triple represents the indexes of the children forming the team. You can print both the teams, and the numbers in the triplets in any order. The children are numbered from1tonin the order of their appearance in the input. Each child must participate in no more than one team.
