Birthdaytime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutAnna's got a birthday today. She invited many guests and cooked a huge (nearly infinite) birthday cake decorated bynbanana circles of different sizes. Maria's birthday is about to start in 7 minutes too, and while Anna is older, she decided to play the boss a little. She told Maria to cut the cake bykstraight-line cuts (the cutting lines can intersect) to divide banana circles into banana pieces.Anna has many guests and she wants everyone to get at least one banana piece. That's why she told Maria to make the total number of banana pieces maximum. It's not a problem if some banana pieces end up on the same cake piece — the key is to make the maximum number of banana pieces. Determine what result Maria will achieve.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk— the number of banana circles and the number of cuts Maria should perform (1 ≤n≤ 1000,1 ≤k≤ 105). Nextnlines contain the positions and sizes of the banana circles (all banana circles are round). On the cake the Cartesian coordinate system is defined. Each line contains three integersx,yandr— the coordinates of the center of the corresponding banana piece and its radius (- 1000 ≤x,y≤ 1000,1 ≤r≤ 1000).It is guaranteed that the banana circles do not intersect, do not touch each other and do not overlap with each other.Pretest 10 is big test withn=k= 1000.OutputPrint the only integer — the largest number of banana pieces that Maria can get after she performs thekstraight-line cuts.Please do not use the%lldspecificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecificator.ExamplesInput1 10 0 1Output2Input3 10 0 13 0 16 0 1Output6Input1 30 0 1Output7", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "78261c5f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ circles on a 2D plane.
