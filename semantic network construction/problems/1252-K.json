Addition Robottime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAdding two numbers several times is a time-consuming task, so you want to build a robot. The robot should have a string $$$S = S_1 S_2 \\\\dots S_N$$$ of $$$N$$$ characters on its memory that represents addition instructions. Each character of the string, $$$S_i$$$, is either 'A' or 'B'.You want to be able to give $$$Q$$$ commands to the robot, each command is either of the following types:1 $$$L$$$ $$$R$$$. The robot should toggle all the characters of $$$S_i$$$ where $$$L \\\\le i \\\\le R$$$. Toggling a character means changing it to 'A' if it was previously 'B', or changing it to 'B' if it was previously 'A'.2 $$$L$$$ $$$R$$$ $$$A$$$ $$$B$$$. The robot should call $$$f(L, R, A, B)$$$ and return two integers as defined in the following pseudocode:function f(L, R, A, B):FOR i from L to Rif S[i] = 'A'A = A + BelseB = A + Breturn (A, B)You want to implement the robot's expected behavior.InputInput begins with a line containing two integers: $$$N$$$ $$$Q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le N, Q \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$) representing the number of characters in the robot's memory and the number of commands, respectively. The next line contains a string $$$S$$$ containing $$$N$$$ characters (each either 'A' or 'B') representing the initial string in the robot's memory. The next $$$Q$$$ lines each contains a command of the following types.1 $$$L$$$ $$$R$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le L \\\\le R \\\\le N$$$)2 $$$L$$$ $$$R$$$ $$$A$$$ $$$B$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le L \\\\le R \\\\le N$$$; $$$0 \\\\le A, B \\\\le 10^9$$$)There is at least one command of the second type.OutputFor each command of the second type in the same order as input, output in a line two integers (separated by a single space), the value of $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ returned by $$$f(L, R, A, B)$$$, respectively. As this output can be large, you need to modulo the output by $$$1\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,007$$$.ExampleInput5 3 ABAAA 2 1 5 1 1 1 3 5 2 2 5 0 1000000000Output11 3 0 1000000000NoteExplanation for the sample input/output #1For the first command, calling $$$f(L, R, A, B)$$$ causes the following:Initially, $$$A = 1$$$ and $$$B = 1$$$.At the end of $$$i = 1$$$, $$$A = 2$$$ and $$$B = 1$$$.At the end of $$$i = 2$$$, $$$A = 2$$$ and $$$B = 3$$$.At the end of $$$i = 3$$$, $$$A = 5$$$ and $$$B = 3$$$.At the end of $$$i = 4$$$, $$$A = 8$$$ and $$$B = 3$$$.At the end of $$$i = 5$$$, $$$A = 11$$$ and $$$B = 3$$$.Therefore, $$$f(L, R, A, B)$$$ will return $$$(11, 3)$$$.For the second command, string $$$S$$$ will be updated to \"ABBBB\".For the third command, the value of $$$A$$$ will always be $$$0$$$ and the value of $$$B$$$ will always be $$$1\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000$$$. Therefore, $$$f(L, R, A, B)$$$ will return $$$(0, 1\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000)$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "bb5860fe", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string of 'A's and 'B's.
