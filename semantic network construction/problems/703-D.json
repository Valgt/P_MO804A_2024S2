Mishka and Interesting sumtime limit per test3.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLittle Mishka enjoys programming. Since her birthday has just passed, her friends decided to present her with array of non-negative integersa1,a2, ...,anofnelements!Mishka loved the array and she instantly decided to determine its beauty value, but she is too little and can't process large arrays. Right because of that she invited you to visit her and asked you to processmqueries.Each query is processed in the following way:Two integerslandr(1 ≤l≤r≤n) are specified — bounds of query segment.Integers, presented in array segment[l,r](in sequence of integersal,al+ 1, ...,ar)even number of times, are written down.XOR-sum of written down integers is calculated, and this value is the answer for a query. Formally, if integers written down in point 2 arex1,x2, ...,xk, then Mishka wants to know the value, where— operator of exclusive bitwise OR.Since only the little bears know the definition of array beauty, all you are to do is to answer each of queries presented.InputThe first line of the input contains single integern(1 ≤n≤ 1 000 000) — the number of elements in the array.The second line of the input containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — array elements.The third line of the input contains single integerm(1 ≤m≤ 1 000 000) — the number of queries.Each of the nextmlines describes corresponding query by a pair of integerslandr(1 ≤l≤r≤n) — the bounds of query segment.OutputPrintmnon-negative integers — the answers for the queries in the order they appear in the input.ExamplesInput33 7 811 3Output0Input71 2 1 3 3 2 354 74 51 31 71 5Output03132NoteIn the second sample:There is no integers in the segment of the first query, presented even number of times in the segment — the answer is0.In the second query there is only integer3is presented even number of times — the answer is3.In the third query only integer1is written down — the answer is1.In the fourth query all array elements are considered.
