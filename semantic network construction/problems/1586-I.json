Omkar and Mosaictime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOmkar is creating a mosaic using colored square tiles, which he places in an $$$n \\\\times n$$$ grid. When the mosaic is complete, each cell in the grid will have either a glaucous or sinoper tile. However, currently he has only placed tiles in some cells.A completed mosaic will be amastapeeceif and only if each tile is adjacent to exactly $$$2$$$ tiles of the same color ($$$2$$$ tiles are adjacent if they share a side.) Omkar wants to fill the rest of the tiles so that the mosaic becomes amastapeece. Now he is wondering, is the way to do this unique, and if it is, what is it?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2000$$$).Then follow $$$n$$$ lines with $$$n$$$ characters in each line. The $$$i$$$-th character in the $$$j$$$-th line corresponds to the cell in row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ of the grid, and will be $$$S$$$ if Omkar has placed a sinoper tile in this cell, $$$G$$$ if Omkar has placed a glaucous tile, $$$.$$$ if it's empty.OutputOn the first line, printUNIQUEif there is a unique way to get a mastapeece,NONEif Omkar cannot create any, andMULTIPLEif there is more than one way to do so.All letters must be uppercase.If you printUNIQUE, then print $$$n$$$ additional lines with $$$n$$$ characters in each line, such that the $$$i$$$-th character in the $$$j^{\\\\text{th}}$$$ line is $$$S$$$ if the tile in row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ of the mastapeece is sinoper, and $$$G$$$ if it is glaucous.ExamplesInput4 S... ..G. .... ...SOutputMULTIPLEInput6 S..... ....G. ..S... .....S ....G.
