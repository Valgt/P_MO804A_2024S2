Soap Time! - 2time limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutImagine the Cartesian coordinate system. There arekdifferent points containing subway stations. One can get from any subway station to any one instantly. That is, the duration of the transfer between any two subway stations can be considered equal to zero. You are allowed to travel only between subway stations, that is, you are not allowed to leave the subway somewhere in the middle of your path, in-between the stations.There arendwarves, they are represented by their coordinates on the plane. The dwarves want to come together and watch a soap opera at some integer point on the plane. For that, they choose the gathering point and start moving towards it simultaneously. In one second a dwarf can move from point(x,y)to one of the following points:(x- 1,y),(x+ 1,y),(x,y- 1),(x,y+ 1). Besides, the dwarves can use the subway as many times as they want (the subway transfers the dwarves instantly). The dwarves do not interfere with each other as they move (that is, the dwarves move simultaneously and independently from each other).Help the dwarves and find the minimum time they need to gather at one point.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 105; 0 ≤k≤ 105)— the number of dwarves and the number of subway stations, correspondingly.The nextnlines contain the coordinates of the dwarves. Thei-th line contains two space-separated integersxiandyi(|xi|, |yi| ≤ 108) — the coordinates of thei-th dwarf. It is guaranteed that all dwarves are located at different points.The nextklines contain the coordinates of the subway stations. Thet-th line contains two space-separated integersxtandyt(|xt|, |yt| ≤ 108) — the coordinates of thet-th subway station. It is guaranteed that all subway stations are located at different points.OutputPrint a single number — the minimum time, in which all dwarves can gather together at one point to watch the soap.ExamplesInput1 02 -2Output0Input2 25 -3-4 -5-4 0-3 -2Output6", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "df53ada8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given the coordinates of $n$ points representing people and $k$ points representing subway stations on a 2D plane.
