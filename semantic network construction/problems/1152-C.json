Neko does Mathstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNeko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?InputThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\\\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.ExamplesInput6 10Output2Input21 31Output9Input5 10Output0NoteIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6975942b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given two integers $a$ and $b$, find the smallest non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is minimized. \n\n\nIf there are multiple values of $k$ that result in the same minimum least common multiple, output the smallest one."}, {"prompt_md5": "71670daa", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Find the smallest non-negative number that, when added to two given numbers, results in the smallest possible least common multiple of the two sums."}]}
