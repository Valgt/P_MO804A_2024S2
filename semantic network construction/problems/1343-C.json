Alternating Subsequencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecall that the sequence $$$b$$$ is a a subsequence of the sequence $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be derived from $$$a$$$ by removing zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, if $$$a=[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$$$, then possible subsequences are: $$$[1, 1, 1, 1]$$$, $$$[3]$$$ and $$$[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$$$, but not $$$[3, 2, 3]$$$ and $$$[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]$$$.You are given a sequence $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive and negative elements (there is no zeros in the sequence).Your task is to choosemaximum by size(length)alternatingsubsequence of the given sequence (i.e. the sign of each next element is the opposite from the sign of the current element, like positive-negative-positive and so on or negative-positive-negative and so on). Among all such subsequences, you have to choose one which has themaximum sumof elements.In other words, if the maximum length ofalternatingsubsequence is $$$k$$$ then your task is to find themaximum sumof elements of somealternatingsubsequence of length $$$k$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9, a_i \\\\ne 0$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — themaximum sumof themaximum by size(length)alternatingsubsequence of $$$a$$$.ExampleInput4 5 1 2 3 -1 -2 4 -1 -2 -1 -3 10 -2 8 3 8 -4 -15 5 -2 -3 1 6 1 -1000000000 1 -1000000000 1 -1000000000Output2 -1 6 -2999999997NoteIn the first test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $$$[1, 2, \\\\underline{3}, \\\\underline{-1}, -2]$$$.In the second test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $$$[-1, -2, \\\\underline{-1}, -3]$$$.In the third test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $$$[\\\\underline{-2}, 8, 3, \\\\underline{8}, \\\\underline{-4}, -15, \\\\underline{5}, \\\\underline{-2}, -3, \\\\underline{1}]$$$.In the fourth test case of the example, one of the possible answers is $$$[\\\\underline{1}, \\\\underline{-1000000000}, \\\\underline{1}, \\\\underline{-1000000000}, \\\\underline{1}, \\\\underline{-1000000000}]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b97b6106", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of positive and negative numbers.  \n\nYour task is to find the alternating subsequence of the given sequence (a subsequence where the signs of the elements alternate) with the maximum sum. \n\nFor example, if the sequence is [1, 2, 3, -1, -2], a possible alternating subsequence is [1, 2, -1, -2] with a sum of 0.\n\nYou need to find the alternating subsequence with the largest sum among all possible alternating subsequences. \n\nYou will be given multiple test cases, each with a different sequence."}, {"prompt_md5": "2469dba7", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers.
