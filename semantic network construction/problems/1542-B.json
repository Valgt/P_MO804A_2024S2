Plus and Multiplytime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is an infinite set generated as follows:$$$1$$$ is in this set.If $$$x$$$ is in this set, $$$x \\\\cdot a$$$ and $$$x+b$$$ both are in this set.For example, when $$$a=3$$$ and $$$b=6$$$, the five smallest elements of the set are:$$$1$$$,$$$3$$$ ($$$1$$$ is in this set, so $$$1\\\\cdot a=3$$$ is in this set),$$$7$$$ ($$$1$$$ is in this set, so $$$1+b=7$$$ is in this set),$$$9$$$ ($$$3$$$ is in this set, so $$$3\\\\cdot a=9$$$ is in this set),$$$13$$$ ($$$7$$$ is in this set, so $$$7+b=13$$$ is in this set).Given positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$n$$$, determine if $$$n$$$ is in this set.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t\\\\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line describing each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq n,a,b\\\\leq 10^9$$$) separated by a single space.OutputFor each test case, print \"Yes\" if $$$n$$$ is in this set, and \"No\" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case.ExampleInput5 24 3 5 10 3 6 2345 1 4 19260817 394 485 19260817 233 264OutputYes No Yes No YesNoteIn the first test case, $$$24$$$ is generated as follows:$$$1$$$ is in this set, so $$$3$$$ and $$$6$$$ are in this set;$$$3$$$ is in this set, so $$$9$$$ and $$$8$$$ are in this set;$$$8$$$ is in this set, so $$$24$$$ and $$$13$$$ are in this set.Thus we can see $$$24$$$ is in this set.The five smallest elements of the set in the second test case is described in statements.
