Given numbern, help him define whether this number can be represented by a sum of two triangular numbers (not necessarily different)!InputThe first input line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 109).OutputPrint \"YES\" (without the quotes), ifncan be represented as a sum of two triangular numbers, otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).ExamplesInput256OutputYESInput512OutputNONoteIn the first sample number.In the second sample number512can not be represented as a sum of two triangular numbers.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "80160c67", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Determine if a given integer can be expressed as the sum of two numbers that can be formed by adding consecutive integers."}, {"prompt_md5": "e9b84a70", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an integer $n$ (1 ≤ $n$ ≤ 10⁹), determine if it can be expressed as the sum of two triangular numbers. \n\nA triangular number is a number that can be represented as $k(k+1)/2$, where $k$ is a positive integer."}]}
