Sum of Threetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp has an integer $$$n$$$.He wants to represent his number as a sum of threedistinctpositive integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$. Additionally, Monocarp wants none of the numbers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ to be divisible by $$$3$$$.Your task is to help Monocarp to find any valid triplet of distinct positive integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$, or report that such a triplet does not exist.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The only line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{9}$$$).OutputFor each testcase, if there is no valid triplet $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$, printNOon the first line.Otherwise, printYESon the first line. On the second line, print any valid triplet of distinct positive integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that $$$x + y + z = n$$$, and none of the printed numbers are divisible by $$$3$$$. If there are multiple valid triplets, you can print any of them.ExampleInput4104159OutputYES 4 5 1 NO YES 2 8 5 NONoteIn the first testcase, one of the valid triplets is $$$x = 4$$$, $$$y = 5$$$, $$$z = 1$$$. None of these numbers are divisible by three, and $$$4 + 5 + 1 = 10$$$.In the second testcase, there is no valid triplet.In the third testcase, one of the valid triplets is $$$x = 2$$$, $$$y = 8$$$, $$$z = 5$$$. None of these numbers are divisible by three, and $$$2 + 8 + 5 = 15$$$.In the fourth testcase, there is no valid triplet.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "93290df7", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an integer $n$, find three distinct positive integers $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that:\n\n* $x + y + z = n$\n* None of $x$, $y$, or $z$ are divisible by 3.\n\nIf no such triplet exists, report that."}, {"prompt_md5": "14bf0c1c", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number, find three distinct positive numbers that add up to that number and are not divisible by 3.
