Split the Multisettime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAmultisetis a set of numbers in which there can be equal elements, and the order of the numbers does not matter. For example, $$$\\\\{2,2,4\\\\}$$$ is a multiset.You have a multiset $$$S$$$. Initially, the multiset contains only one positive integer $$$n$$$. That is, $$$S=\\\\{n\\\\}$$$. Additionally, there is a given positive integer $$$k$$$.In one operation, you can select any positive integer $$$u$$$ in $$$S$$$ and remove one copy of $$$u$$$ from $$$S$$$. Then, insert no more than $$$k$$$ positive integers into $$$S$$$ so that the sum of all inserted integers is equal to $$$u$$$.Find the minimum number of operations to make $$$S$$$ contain $$$n$$$ ones.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The only line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n,k$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 1000,2\\\\le k\\\\le 1000$$$).OutputFor each testcase, print one integer, which is the required answer.ExampleInput41 55 26 316 4Output0 4 3 5NoteFor the first test case, initially $$$S=\\\\{1\\\\}$$$, already satisfying the requirement. Therefore, we need zero operations.For the second test case, initially $$$S=\\\\{5\\\\}$$$. We can apply the following operations:Select $$$u=5$$$, remove $$$u$$$ from $$$S$$$, and insert $$$2,3$$$ into $$$S$$$. Now, $$$S=\\\\{2,3\\\\}$$$.Select $$$u=2$$$, remove $$$u$$$ from $$$S$$$, and insert $$$1,1$$$ into $$$S$$$. Now, $$$S=\\\\{1,1,3\\\\}$$$.Select $$$u=3$$$, remove $$$u$$$ from $$$S$$$, and insert $$$1,2$$$ into $$$S$$$. Now, $$$S=\\\\{1,1,1,2\\\\}$$$.Select $$$u=2$$$, remove $$$u$$$ from $$$S$$$, and insert $$$1,1$$$ into $$$S$$$. Now, $$$S=\\\\{1,1,1,1,1\\\\}$$$.Using $$$4$$$ operations in total, we achieve the goal.For the third test case, initially $$$S=\\\\{6\\\\}$$$. We can apply the following operations:Select $$$u=6$$$, remove $$$u$$$ from $$$S$$$, and insert $$$1,2,3$$$ into $$$S$$$. Now, $$$S=\\\\{1,2,3\\\\}$$$.Select $$$u=2$$$, remove $$$u$$$ from $$$S$$$, and insert $$$1,1$$$ into $$$S$$$. Now, $$$S=\\\\{1,1,1,3\\\\}$$$.Select $$$u=3$$$, remove $$$u$$$ from $$$S$$$, and insert $$$1,1,1$$$ into $$$S$$$. Now, $$$S=\\\\{1,1,1,1,1,1\\\\}$$$.Using $$$3$$$ operations in total, we achieve the goal.For the fourth test case, initially $$$S=\\\\{16\\\\}$$$. We can apply the following operations:Select $$$u=16$$$, remove $$$u$$$ from $$$S$$$, and insert $$$4,4,4,4$$$ into $$$S$$$. Now, $$$S=\\\\{4,4,4,4\\\\}$$$.Repeat for $$$4$$$ times: select $$$u=4$$$, remove $$$u$$$ from $$$S$$$, and insert $$$1,1,1,1$$$ into $$$S$$$.Using $$$5$$$ operations in total, we achieve the goal.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "39032f87", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a multiset $S$ that initially contains only one positive integer $n$.
