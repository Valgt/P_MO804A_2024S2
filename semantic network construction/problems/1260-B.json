Obtain Two Zeroestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. You may perform any number of operations on them (possibly zero).During each operation you should choose any positive integer $$$x$$$ and set $$$a := a - x$$$, $$$b := b - 2x$$$ or $$$a := a - 2x$$$, $$$b := b - x$$$. Note that you may choose different values of $$$x$$$ in different operations.Is it possible to make $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal to $$$0$$$ simultaneously?Your program should answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.Then the test cases follow, each test case is represented by one line containing two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ for this test case ($$$0 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case print the answer to it —YESif it is possible to make $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal to $$$0$$$ simultaneously, andNOotherwise.You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESwill all be recognized as positive answer).ExampleInput3 6 9 1 1 1 2OutputYES NO YESNoteIn the first test case of the example two operations can be used to make both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal to zero:choose $$$x = 4$$$ and set $$$a := a - x$$$, $$$b := b - 2x$$$.
