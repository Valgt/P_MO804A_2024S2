Burglar and Matchestime limit per test0.5 secondmemory limit per test64 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutA burglar got into a matches warehouse and wants to steal as many matches as possible. In the warehouse there aremcontainers, in thei-th container there areaimatchboxes, and each matchbox containsbimatches. All the matchboxes are of the same size. The burglar's rucksack can holdnmatchboxes exactly. Your task is to find out the maximum amount of matches that a burglar can carry away. He has no time to rearrange matches in the matchboxes, that's why he just chooses not more thannmatchboxes so that the total amount of matches in them is maximal.InputThe first line of the input contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 2·108) and integerm(1 ≤m≤ 20).
