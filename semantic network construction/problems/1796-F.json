Strange Triplestime limit per test10 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call a triple of positive integers ($$$a, b, n$$$)strangeif the equality $$$\\\\frac{an}{nb} = \\\\frac{a}{b}$$$ holds, where $$$an$$$ is the concatenation of $$$a$$$ and $$$n$$$ and $$$nb$$$ is the concatenation of $$$n$$$ and $$$b$$$. For the purpose of concatenation, the integers are considered without leading zeroes.For example, if $$$a = 1$$$, $$$b = 5$$$ and $$$n = 9$$$, then the triple is strange, because $$$\\\\frac{19}{95} = \\\\frac{1}{5}$$$. But $$$a = 7$$$, $$$b = 3$$$ and $$$n = 11$$$ is not strange, because $$$\\\\frac{711}{113} \\\\ne \\\\frac{7}{3}$$$.You are given three integers $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$ and $$$N$$$.
