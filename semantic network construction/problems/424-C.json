Magic Formulastime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutPeople in the Tomskaya region like magic formulas very much. You can see some of them below.Imagine you are given a sequence of positive integer numbersp1,p2, ...,pn. Lets write down some magic formulas:Here, \"mod\" means the operation of taking the residue after dividing.The expressionmeans applying the bitwisexor(excluding \"OR\") operation to integersxandy. The given operation exists in all modern programming languages. For example, in languages C++ and Java it is represented by \"^\", in Pascal — by \"xor\".People in the Tomskaya region like magic formulas very much, but they don't like to calculate them! Therefore you are given the sequencep, calculate the value ofQ.InputThe first line of the input contains the only integern(1 ≤n≤ 106). The next line containsnintegers:p1,p2, ...,pn(0 ≤pi≤ 2·109).OutputThe only line of output should contain a single integer — the value ofQ.ExamplesInput31 2 3Output3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "292a34ce", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of positive integers $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$.
