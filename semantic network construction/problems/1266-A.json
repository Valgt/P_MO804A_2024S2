Competitive Programmertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBob is a competitive programmer. He wants to become red, and for that he needs a strict training regime. He went to the annual meeting of grandmasters and asked $$$n$$$ of them how much effort they needed to reach red.\"Oh, I just spent $$$x_i$$$hourssolving problems\", said the $$$i$$$-th of them.Bob wants to train his math skills, so for each answer he wrote down the number ofminutes($$$60 \\\\cdot x_i$$$), thanked the grandmasters and went home. Bob could write numbers with leading zeroes — for example, if some grandmaster answered that he had spent $$$2$$$ hours, Bob could write $$$000120$$$ instead of $$$120$$$.Alice wanted to tease Bob and so she took the numbers Bob wrote down, and for each of them she did one of the following independently:rearranged its digits, orwrote a random number.This way, Alice generated $$$n$$$ numbers, denoted $$$y_1$$$, ..., $$$y_n$$$.For each of the numbers, help Bob determine whether $$$y_i$$$ can be a permutation of a number divisible by $$$60$$$ (possibly with leading zeroes).InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 418$$$) — the number of grandmasters Bob asked.Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains a single integer $$$y_i$$$ — the number that Alice wrote down.Each of these numbers has between $$$2$$$ and $$$100$$$ digits '0' through '9'. They can contain leading zeroes.OutputOutput $$$n$$$ lines.For each $$$i$$$, output the following. If it is possible to rearrange the digits of $$$y_i$$$ such that the resulting number is divisible by $$$60$$$, output \"red\" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output \"cyan\".ExampleInput6 603 006 205 228 1053 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000Outputred red cyan cyan cyan redNoteIn the first example, there is one rearrangement that yields a number divisible by $$$60$$$, and that is $$$360$$$.In the second example, there are two solutions. One is $$$060$$$ and the second is $$$600$$$.In the third example, there are $$$6$$$ possible rearrangments: $$$025$$$, $$$052$$$, $$$205$$$, $$$250$$$, $$$502$$$, $$$520$$$. None of these numbers is divisible by $$$60$$$.In the fourth example, there are $$$3$$$ rearrangements: $$$228$$$, $$$282$$$, $$$822$$$.In the fifth example, none of the $$$24$$$ rearrangements result in a number divisible by $$$60$$$.In the sixth example, note that $$$000\\\\dots0$$$ is a valid solution.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1c060bdd", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ numbers.
