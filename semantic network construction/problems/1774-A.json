Can you help her?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 2\\\\,000$$$)  – the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a string of length $$$n - 1$$$ consisting of $$$-$$$ and $$$+$$$ on a separate line. If there is more than one assignment of signs that produces the smallest possible absolute value, any of them is accepted.ExampleInput3211501101510001Output- +-++ +++-NoteIn the first test case, we can get the expression $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$, with absolute value $$$0$$$.In the second test case, we can get the expression $$$0 + 1 - 1 + 0 + 1 = 1$$$, with absolute value $$$1$$$.In the third test case, we can get the expression $$$1 + 0 + 0 + 0 - 1 = 0$$$, with absolute value $$$0$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e520003c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string consisting of only 0s and 1s.
