Distinct Splittime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's denote the $$$f(x)$$$ function for a string $$$x$$$ as the number of distinct characters that the string contains. For example $$$f(\\\\texttt{abc}) = 3$$$, $$$f(\\\\texttt{bbbbb}) = 1$$$, and $$$f(\\\\texttt{babacaba}) = 3$$$.Given a string $$$s$$$, split it into two non-empty strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that $$$f(a) + f(b)$$$ is the maximum possible. In other words, find the maximum possible value of $$$f(a) + f(b)$$$ such that $$$a + b = s$$$ (the concatenation of string $$$a$$$ and string $$$b$$$ is equal to string $$$s$$$).InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer  — the maximum possible value of $$$f(a) + f(b)$$$ such that $$$a + b = s$$$.ExampleInput52aa7abcabcd5aaaaa10paiumoment4aazzOutput2 7 2 10 3NoteFor the first test case, there is only one valid way to split $$$\\\\texttt{aa}$$$ into two non-empty strings $$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$ and $$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$, and $$$f(\\\\texttt{a}) + f(\\\\texttt{a}) = 1 + 1 = 2$$$.For the second test case, by splitting $$$\\\\texttt{abcabcd}$$$ into $$$\\\\texttt{abc}$$$ and $$$\\\\texttt{abcd}$$$ we can get the answer of $$$f(\\\\texttt{abc}) + f(\\\\texttt{abcd}) = 3 + 4 = 7$$$ which is maximum possible.For the third test case, it doesn't matter how we split the string, the answer will always be $$$2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5b1201a4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string $s$.
