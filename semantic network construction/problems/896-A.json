Note that the quotes in the very beginning and in the very end are for clarity and are not a part off1.It can be seen that the characters infiare letters, question marks, (possibly) quotation marks and spaces.Nephren will ask the little leprechaunsqtimes. Each time she will let them find thek-th character offn. The characters are indexed starting from1. Iffnconsists of less thankcharacters, output '.' (without quotes).Can you answer her queries?InputThe first line contains one integerq(1 ≤q≤ 10) — the number of Nephren's questions.Each of the nextqlines describes Nephren's question and contains two integersnandk(0 ≤n≤ 105, 1 ≤k≤ 1018).OutputOne line containingqcharacters.
