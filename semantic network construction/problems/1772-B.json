Matrix Rotationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a matrix $$$2 \\\\times 2$$$ filled withdistinctintegers. You want your matrix to become beautiful. The matrix is beautiful if the following two conditions are satisfied:in each row, the first element is smaller than the second element;in each column, the first element is smaller than the second element.You can perform the following operation on the matrix any number of times: rotate it clockwise by $$$90$$$ degrees, so the top left element shifts to the top right cell, the top right element shifts to the bottom right cell, and so on:Determine if it is possible to make the matrix beautiful by applying zero or more operations.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. Each of those lines contains two integers — the elements of the corresponding row of the matrix. In each matrix, all four elements are distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$100$$$.OutputFor each test case, printYESif the matrix can become beautiful, orNOotherwise. You may print each letter in any case (YES,yes,Yeswill all be recognized as positive answer,NO,noandnOwill all be recognized as negative answer).ExampleInput61 35 78 103 48 104 36 19 27 54 21 24 3OutputYES YES NO YES YES NO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "548699c7", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a 2x2 matrix of distinct integers from 1 to 100.
