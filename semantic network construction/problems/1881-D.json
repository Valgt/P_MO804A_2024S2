Divide and Equalizetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You can perform the following operation on it:Choose a pair of elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i, j \\\\le n$$$ and $$$i \\\\neq j$$$);Choose one of the divisors of the integer $$$a_i$$$, i.e., an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$a_i \\\\bmod x = 0$$$;Replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$\\\\frac{a_i}{x}$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ with $$$a_j \\\\cdot x$$$.Determine whether it is possible to make all elements in the array the same by applying the operation a certain number of times (possibly zero).For example, let's consider the array $$$a$$$ = [$$$100, 2, 50, 10, 1$$$] with $$$5$$$ elements. Perform two operations on it:Choose $$$a_3 = 50$$$ and $$$a_2 = 2$$$, $$$x = 5$$$. Replace $$$a_3$$$ with $$$\\\\frac{a_3}{x} = \\\\frac{50}{5} = 10$$$, and $$$a_2$$$ with $$$a_2 \\\\cdot x = 2 \\\\cdot 5 = 10$$$. The resulting array is $$$a$$$ = [$$$100, 10, 10, 10, 1$$$];Choose $$$a_1 = 100$$$ and $$$a_5 = 1$$$, $$$x = 10$$$. Replace $$$a_1$$$ with $$$\\\\frac{a_1}{x} = \\\\frac{100}{10} = 10$$$, and $$$a_5$$$ with $$$a_5 \\\\cdot x = 1 \\\\cdot 10 = 10$$$. The resulting array is $$$a$$$ = [$$$10, 10, 10, 10, 10$$$].After performing these operations, all elements in the array $$$a$$$ become equal to $$$10$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2000$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follows the description of each test case.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single line:\"YES\" if it is possible to make all elements in the array equal by applying the operation a certain (possibly zero) number of times;\"NO\" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will all be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput75100 2 50 10 131 1 148 2 4 2430 50 27 20275 4024 432 3 1OutputYES YES NO YES NO YES NONoteThe first test case is explained in the problem statement.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "893d76a2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of positive integers.
