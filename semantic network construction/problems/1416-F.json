Showing Offtime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAnother dull quarantine day was going by whenBTherodecided to start researching matrices of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$. The rows are numerated $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$ from top to bottom, and the columns are numerated $$$1$$$ through $$$m$$$ from left to right. The cell in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column is denoted as $$$(i, j)$$$.For each cell $$$(i, j)$$$BTherohad two values:The cost of the cell, which is a singlepositiveinteger.The direction of the cell, which is one of charactersL,R,D,U. Those characters correspond to transitions to adjacent cells $$$(i, j - 1)$$$, $$$(i, j + 1)$$$, $$$(i + 1, j)$$$ or $$$(i - 1, j)$$$, respectively. No transition pointed outside of the matrix.Let us call a cell $$$(i_2, j_2)$$$reachablefrom $$$(i_1, j_1)$$$, if, starting from $$$(i_1, j_1)$$$ and repeatedly moving to the adjacent cell according to our current direction, we will, sooner or later, visit $$$(i_2, j_2)$$$.BTherodecided to create another matrix from the existing two. For a cell $$$(i, j)$$$, let us denote $$$S_{i, j}$$$ as a set of all reachable cells from it (including $$$(i, j)$$$ itself). Then, the value at the cell $$$(i, j)$$$ in the new matrix will be equal to the sum of costs of all cells in $$$S_{i, j}$$$.After quickly computing the new matrix,BTheroimmediately sent it to his friends. However, he did not save any of the initial matrices! Help him to restore any two valid matrices, which produce the current one.InputThe first line of input file contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 100$$$) denoting the number of test cases. The description of $$$T$$$ test cases follows.First line of a test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\cdot m \\\\le 10^5$$$).Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contain exactly $$$m$$$ integers â€” the elements of the produced matrix. Each element belongs to the segment $$$[2, 10^9]$$$.It is guaranteed that $$$\\\\sum{(n \\\\cdot m)}$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, if an answer does not exist, print a single wordNO. Otherwise, printYESand both matrices in the same format as in the input.The first matrix should be thecost matrixand the second matrix should be thedirection matrix.All integers in thecost matrixshould be positive.All characters in thedirection matrixshould be valid. No direction should point outside of the matrix.ExampleInput2 3 4 7 6 7 8 5 5 4 4 5 7 4 4 1 1 5OutputYES 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 3 2 1 1 R D L L D R D L U L R U NO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2b77803e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a matrix of size $n \\times m$ representing the sum of costs of all reachable cells from each cell. \n\nYou need to determine if it's possible to find two matrices, one representing the costs of individual cells and the other representing the direction of movement from each cell (L, R, D, U), such that the given matrix is the result of summing the costs of all reachable cells from each cell in the cost matrix.\n\n**Input:**\n\n* The first line contains an integer $T$ representing the number of test cases.\n* For each test case:\n    * The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ representing the size of the matrix.\n    * The following $n$ lines contain $m$ integers representing the sum of costs for each cell in the given matrix.\n\n**Output:**\n\n* For each test case:\n    * If it's possible to find the two matrices, print \"YES\" followed by the cost matrix and the direction matrix.\n    * If it's not possible, print \"NO\"."}, {"prompt_md5": "c521aeff", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a matrix of numbers.
