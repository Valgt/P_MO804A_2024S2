Captain Flint and Crew Recruitmenttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDespite his bad reputation, Captain Flint is a friendly person (at least, friendly to animals). Now Captain Flint is searching worthy sailors to join his new crew (solely for peaceful purposes). A sailor is considered as worthy if he can solve Flint's task.Recently, out of blue Captain Flint has been interested in math and even defined a new class of integers. Let's define a positive integer $$$x$$$ asnearly primeif it can be represented as $$$p \\\\cdot q$$$, where $$$1 < p < q$$$ and $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are prime numbers. For example, integers $$$6$$$ and $$$10$$$ are nearly primes (since $$$2 \\\\cdot 3 = 6$$$ and $$$2 \\\\cdot 5 = 10$$$), but integers $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$16$$$, $$$17$$$ or $$$44$$$ are not.Captain Flint guessed an integer $$$n$$$ and asked you: can you represent it asthe sum of $$$4$$$different positiveintegerswhereat least $$$3$$$of them should benearly prime.Uncle Bogdan easily solved the task and joined the crew. Can you do the same?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Next $$$t$$$ lines contain test cases — one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains the single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5)$$$ — the number Flint guessed.OutputFor each test case print:YESand $$$4$$$differentpositive integers such that at least $$$3$$$ of them are nearly prime and their sum is equal to $$$n$$$ (if there are multiple answers print any of them);NOif there is no way to represent $$$n$$$ asthe sum of $$$4$$$different positiveintegerswhere at least $$$3$$$ of them are nearly prime.You can print each character ofYESorNOin any case.ExampleInput7 7 23 31 36 44 100 258OutputNO NO YES 14 10 6 1 YES 5 6 10 15 YES 6 7 10 21 YES 2 10 33 55 YES 10 21 221 6NoteIn the first and second test cases, it can be proven that there are no four different positive integers such that at least three of them are nearly prime.In the third test case, $$$n=31=2 \\\\cdot 7 + 2 \\\\cdot 5 + 2 \\\\cdot 3 + 1$$$: integers $$$14$$$, $$$10$$$, $$$6$$$ are nearly prime.In the fourth test case, $$$n=36=5 + 2 \\\\cdot 3 + 2 \\\\cdot 5 + 3 \\\\cdot 5$$$: integers $$$6$$$, $$$10$$$, $$$15$$$ are nearly prime.In the fifth test case, $$$n=44=2 \\\\cdot 3 + 7 + 2 \\\\cdot 5 + 3 \\\\cdot 7$$$: integers $$$6$$$, $$$10$$$, $$$21$$$ are nearly prime.In the sixth test case, $$$n=100=2 + 2 \\\\cdot 5 + 3 \\\\cdot 11 + 5 \\\\cdot 11$$$: integers $$$10$$$, $$$33$$$, $$$55$$$ are nearly prime.In the seventh test case, $$$n=258=2 \\\\cdot 5 + 3 \\\\cdot 7 + 13 \\\\cdot 17 + 2 \\\\cdot 3$$$: integers $$$10$$$, $$$21$$$, $$$221$$$, $$$6$$$ are nearly prime.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "735082de", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number, determine if it can be expressed as the sum of four different positive integers where at least three of them are the product of two prime numbers (one smaller than the other).
