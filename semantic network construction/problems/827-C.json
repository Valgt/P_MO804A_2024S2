DNA Evolutiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEveryone knows that DNA strands consist of nucleotides. There are four types of nucleotides: \"A\", \"T\", \"G\", \"C\". A DNA strand is a sequence of nucleotides. Scientists decided to track evolution of a rare species, which DNA strand was stringsinitially.Evolution of the species is described as a sequence of changes in the DNA. Every change is a change of some nucleotide, for example, the following change can happen in DNA strand \"AAGC\": the second nucleotide can change to \"T\" so that the resulting DNA strand is \"ATGC\".Scientists know that some segments of the DNA strand can be affected by some unknown infections. They can represent an infection as a sequence of nucleotides. Scientists are interested if there are any changes caused by some infections. Thus they sometimes want to know the value of impact of some infection to some segment of the DNA. This value is computed as follows:Let the infection be represented as a stringe, and let scientists be interested in DNA strand segment starting from positionlto positionr, inclusive.Prefix of the stringeee...(i.e. the string that consists of infinitely many repeats of stringe) is written under the stringsfrom positionlto positionr, inclusive.The value of impact is the number of positions where letter of stringscoincided with the letter written under it.Being a developer, Innokenty is interested in bioinformatics also, so the scientists asked him for help. Innokenty is busy preparing VK Cup, so he decided to delegate the problem to the competitors. Help the scientists!InputThe first line contains the strings(1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105) that describes the initial DNA strand. It consists only of capital English letters \"A\", \"T\", \"G\" and \"C\".The next line contains single integerq(1 ≤q≤ 105) — the number of events.After that,qlines follow, each describes one event. Each of the lines has one of two formats:1 x c, wherexis an integer (1 ≤x≤ |s|), andcis a letter \"A\", \"T\", \"G\" or \"C\", which means that there is a change in the DNA: the nucleotide at positionxis nowc.2 l r e, wherel,rare integers (1 ≤l≤r≤ |s|), andeis a string of letters \"A\", \"T\", \"G\" and \"C\" (1 ≤ |e| ≤ 10), which means that scientists are interested in the value of impact of infectioneto the segment of DNA strand from positionlto positionr, inclusive.OutputFor each scientists' query (second type query) print a single integer in a new line — the value of impact of the infection on the DNA.ExamplesInputATGCATGC42 1 8 ATGC2 2 6 TTT1 4 T2 2 6 TAOutput824InputGAGTTGTTAA62 3 4 TATGGTG1 1 T1 6 G2 5 9 AGTAATA1 10 G2 2 6 TTGTOutput031NoteConsider the first example.
