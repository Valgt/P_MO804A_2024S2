K-th Not Divisible by ntime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Print the $$$k$$$-th positive integer that is not divisible by $$$n$$$.For example, if $$$n=3$$$, and $$$k=7$$$, then all numbers that are not divisible by $$$3$$$ are: $$$1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 \\\\dots$$$. The $$$7$$$-th number among them is $$$10$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases in the input.
