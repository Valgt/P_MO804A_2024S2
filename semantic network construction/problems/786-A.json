Berzerktime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRick and Morty are playing their own version of Berzerk (which has nothing in common with the famous Berzerk game). This game needs a huge space, so they play it with a computer.In this game there arenobjects numbered from1tonarranged in a circle (in clockwise order). Object number1is a black hole and the others are planets. There's a monster in one of the planet. Rick and Morty don't know on which one yet, only that he's not initially in the black hole, but Unity will inform them before the game starts. But for now, they want to be prepared for every possible scenario.Each one of them has a set of numbers between1andn- 1(inclusive). Rick's set iss1withk1elements and Morty's iss2withk2elements. One of them goes first and the player changes alternatively. In each player's turn, he should choose an arbitrary number likexfrom his set and the monster will move to hisx-th next object from its current position (clockwise). If after his move the monster gets to the black hole he wins.Your task is that for each of monster's initial positions and who plays first determine if the starter wins, loses, or the game will stuck in an infinite loop. In case when player can lose or make game infinity, it more profitable to choose infinity game.InputThe first line of input contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 7000) — number of objects in game.The second line contains integerk1followed byk1distinct integerss1, 1,s1, 2, ...,s1,k1— Rick's set.The third line contains integerk2followed byk2distinct integerss2, 1,s2, 2, ...,s2,k2— Morty's set1 ≤ki≤n- 1and1 ≤si, 1,si, 2, ...,si,ki≤n- 1for1 ≤i≤ 2.OutputIn the first line printn- 1words separated by spaces wherei-th word is \"Win\" (without quotations) if in the scenario that Rick plays first and monster is initially in object numberi+ 1he wins, \"Lose\" if he loses and \"Loop\" if the game will never end.Similarly, in the second line printn- 1words separated by spaces wherei-th word is \"Win\" (without quotations) if in the scenario that Morty plays first and monster is initially in object numberi+ 1he wins, \"Lose\" if he loses and \"Loop\" if the game will never end.ExamplesInput52 3 23 1 2 3OutputLose Win Win LoopLoop Win Win WinInput84 6 2 3 42 3 6OutputWin Win Win Win Win Win WinLose Win Lose Lose Win Lose Lose", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4d2a8701", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ objects arranged in a circle.
