Binary Periodtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's say string $$$s$$$ has period $$$k$$$ if $$$s_i = s_{i + k}$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$|s| - k$$$ ($$$|s|$$$ means length of string $$$s$$$) and $$$k$$$ is the minimum positive integer with this property.Some examples of a period: for $$$s$$$=\"0101\" the period is $$$k=2$$$, for $$$s$$$=\"0000\" the period is $$$k=1$$$, for $$$s$$$=\"010\" the period is $$$k=2$$$, for $$$s$$$=\"0011\" the period is $$$k=4$$$.You are given string $$$t$$$ consisting only of0's and1's and you need to find such string $$$s$$$ that:String $$$s$$$ consists only of0's and1's;The length of $$$s$$$ doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot |t|$$$;String $$$t$$$ is a subsequence of string $$$s$$$;String $$$s$$$ has smallest possible period among all strings that meet conditions 1—3.Let us recall that $$$t$$$ is a subsequence of $$$s$$$ if $$$t$$$ can be derived from $$$s$$$ by deleting zero or more elements (any) without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, $$$t$$$=\"011\" is a subsequence of $$$s$$$=\"10101\".InputThe first line contains single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.Next $$$T$$$ lines contain test cases — one per line. Each line contains string $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |t| \\\\le 100$$$) consisting only of0's and1's.OutputPrint one string for each test case — string $$$s$$$ you needed to find. If there are multiple solutions print any one of them.ExampleInput4 00 01 111 110Output00 01 11111 1010NoteIn the first and second test cases, $$$s = t$$$ since it's already one of the optimal solutions. Answers have periods equal to $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, respectively.In the third test case, there are shorter optimal solutions, but it's okay since we don't need to minimize the string $$$s$$$. String $$$s$$$ has period equal to $$$1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2fc28d57", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string  $t$ consisting only of 0s and 1s.
