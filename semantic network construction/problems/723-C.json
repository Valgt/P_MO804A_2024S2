Polycarp at the Radiotime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp is a music editor at the radio station. He received a playlist for tomorrow, that can be represented as a sequencea1,a2, ...,an, whereaiis a band, which performs thei-th song. Polycarp likes bands with the numbers from1tom, but he doesn't really like others.We define asbjthe number of songs the groupjis going to perform tomorrow. Polycarp wants to change the playlist in such a way that the minimum among the numbersb1,b2, ...,bmwill be as large as possible.Find this maximum possible value of the minimum among thebj(1 ≤j≤m), and the minimum number of changes in the playlist Polycarp needs to make to achieve it. One change in the playlist is a replacement of the performer of thei-th song with any other group.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersnandm(1 ≤m≤n≤ 2000).The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109), whereaiis the performer of thei-th song.OutputIn the first line print two integers: the maximum possible value of the minimum among thebj(1 ≤j≤m), wherebjis the number of songs in the changed playlist performed by thej-th band, and the minimum number of changes in the playlist Polycarp needs to make.In the second line print the changed playlist.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput4 21 2 3 2Output2 11 2 1 2Input7 31 3 2 2 2 2 1Output2 11 3 3 2 2 2 1Input4 41000000000 100 7 1000000000Output1 41 2 3 4NoteIn the first sample, after Polycarp's changes the first band performs two songs (b1= 2), and the second band also performs two songs (b2= 2). Thus, the minimum of these values equals to2. It is impossible to achieve a higher minimum value by any changes in the playlist.In the second sample, after Polycarp's changes the first band performs two songs (b1= 2), the second band performs three songs (b2= 3), and the third band also performs two songs (b3= 2). Thus, the best minimum value is2.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "fbce8ded", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a playlist of $n$ songs, where each song is performed by a band numbered from 1 to $m$.
