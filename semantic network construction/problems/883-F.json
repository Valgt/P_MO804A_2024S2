For this reason, two words \"ulyana\" and \"oolyana\" denote the same name.The second ambiguity is about the Berland soundh: one can use both \"h\" and \"kh\" to write it. For example, the words \"mihail\" and \"mikhail\" denote the same name.There arenusers registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account?Formally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements \"u\"\"oo\" and \"h\"\"kh\", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements.For example, the following pairs of words denote the same name:\"koouper\" and \"kuooper\". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: \"koouper\"\"kuuper\" and \"kuooper\"\"kuuper\".\"khun\" and \"kkkhoon\". With the replacements described above you can make both words to be equal: \"khun\"\"khoon\" and \"kkkhoon\"\"kkhoon\"\"khoon\".For a given list of words, find the minimal number of groups where the words in each group denote the same name.InputThe first line contains integer numbern(2 ≤n≤ 400) — number of the words in the list.The followingnlines contain words, one word per line. Each word consists of only lowercase Latin letters. The length of each word is between1and20letters inclusive.OutputPrint the minimal number of groups where the words in each group denote the same name.ExamplesInput10mihailoolyanakooooperhoonulyanakooupermikhailkhunkuooperkkkhoonOutput4Input9haritonhkaritonbuoikkkharitonboooibuikharitonbouiboiOutput5Input2alexalexOutput1NoteThere are four groups of words in the first example.
