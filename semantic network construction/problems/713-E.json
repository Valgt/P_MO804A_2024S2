Sonya Partymakertime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOwl Sonya decided to become a partymaker. To train for this role she gather all her owl friends in the country house. There aremchairs located in a circle and consequently numbered with integers from1tom. Thus, chairsiandi+ 1are neighbouring for allifrom1tom- 1. Chairs1andmare also neighbouring. Some chairs are occupied by her friends. There arenfriends in total. No two friends occupy the same chair. Rules are the following:Each participant removes from the game the chair he is currently sitting on.Each of the participants choose a direction that she will follow: clockwise (indices increase, frommgoes to1) and counter-clockwise (indices decrease, from1goes tom). This direction may coincide or be different for any pair of owls.Each turn all guests move one step in the chosen directions. If some guest move to the position with a chair there, he removes this chair from the game.Game ends if there are no more chairs left in the game.Owls are very busy and want to get rid of the game as soon as possible. They cooperate to pick the direction. Your goal is to find the minimum number o moves required to finish the game.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integerm(1 ≤m≤ 109) — the length of the circle.The second line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 100 000) — the number of friends.Last line contains an increasing sequence ofnintegersai(1 ≤ai≤m) — initial positions of all owls.OutputPrint the minimum number of move required to finish the game.
