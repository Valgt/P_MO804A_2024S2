Laboratory Worktime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAnya and Kirill are doing a physics laboratory work. In one of the tasks they have to measure some valuentimes, and then compute the average value to lower the error.Kirill has already made his measurements, and has got the following integer values:x1,x2, ...,xn. It is important that the values are close to each other, namely, the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value isat most2.Anya does not want to make the measurements, however, she can't just copy the values from Kirill's work, because the error of each measurement is a random value, and this coincidence will be noted by the teacher. Anya wants to write such integer valuesy1,y2, ...,ynin her work, that the following conditions are met:the average value ofx1,x2, ...,xnis equal to the average value ofy1,y2, ...,yn;all Anya's measurements are in the same bounds as all Kirill's measurements, that is, the maximum value among Anya's values is not greater than the maximum value among Kirill's values, and the minimum value among Anya's values is not less than the minimum value among Kirill's values;the number of equal measurements in Anya's work and Kirill's work is as small as possible among options with the previous conditions met. Formally, the teacher goes through all Anya's values one by one, if there is equal value in Kirill's work and it is not strike off yet, he strikes off this Anya's value and one of equal values in Kirill's work. The number of equal measurements is then the total number ofstrike offvalues in Anya's work.Help Anya to write such a set of measurements that the conditions above are met.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 100 000) — the numeber of measurements made by Kirill.The second line contains a sequence of integersx1,x2, ...,xn(- 100 000 ≤xi≤ 100 000) — the measurements made by Kirill. It is guaranteed that the difference between the maximum and minimum values among valuesx1,x2, ...,xndoes not exceed2.OutputIn the first line print the minimum possible number of equal measurements.In the second line printnintegersy1,y2, ...,yn— the values Anya should write. You can print the integers in arbitrary order. Keep in mind that the minimum value among Anya's values should be not less that the minimum among Kirill's values, and the maximum among Anya's values should be not greater than the maximum among Kirill's values.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput6-1 1 1 0 0 -1Output20 0 0 0 0 0Input3100 100 101Output3101 100 100Input7-10 -9 -10 -8 -10 -9 -9Output5-10 -10 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9NoteIn the first example Anya can write zeros as here measurements results. The average value is then equal to the average value of Kirill's values, and there are only two equal measurements.In the second example Anya should write two values100and one value101(in any order), because it is the only possibility to make the average be the equal to the average of Kirill's values. Thus, all three measurements are equal.In the third example the number of equal measurements is5.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "cd6d10eb", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of $n$ integers ($n \\le 100,000$) representing measurements.
