Algoland and Berlandtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOnce upon a time Algoland and Berland were a single country, but those times are long gone. Now they are two different countries, but their cities are scattered on a common territory.All cities are represented as points on the Cartesian plane. Algoland consists of $$$a$$$ cities numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$a$$$. The coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th Algoland city are a pair of integer numbers $$$(xa_i, ya_i)$$$. Similarly, Berland consists of $$$b$$$ cities numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$b$$$. The coordinates of the $$$j$$$-th Berland city are a pair of integer numbers $$$(xb_j, yb_j)$$$.No three of the $$$a+b$$$ mentioned cities lie on a single straight line.As the first step to unite the countries, Berland decided to build several bidirectional freeways. Each freeway is going to be a line segment that starts in a Berland city and ends in an Algoland city. Freeways can't intersect with each other at any point except freeway's start or end. Moreover, the freeways have to connect all $$$a+b$$$ cities. Here, connectivity means that one can get from any of the specified $$$a+b$$$ cities to any other of the $$$a+b$$$ cities using freeways. Note that all freeways are bidirectional, which means that one can drive on each of them in both directions.Mayor of each of the $$$b$$$ Berland cities allocated a budget to build the freeways that start from this city. Thus, you are given the numbers $$$r_1, r_2, \\\\dots, r_b$$$, where $$$r_j$$$ is the number of freeways that are going to start in the $$$j$$$-th Berland city. The total allocated budget is very tight and only covers building the minimal necessary set of freeways. In other words, $$$r_1+r_2+\\\\dots+r_b=a+b-1$$$.Help Berland to build the freeways so that:each freeway is a line segment connecting a Berland city and an Algoland city,no freeways intersect with each other except for the freeway's start or end,freeways connect all $$$a+b$$$ cities (all freeways are bidirectional),there are $$$r_j$$$ freeways that start from the $$$j$$$-th Berland city.InputInput contains one or several test cases. The first input line contains a single integer number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 3000$$$) — number of test cases. Then, $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Solve test cases separately, test cases are completely independent and do not affect each other.Each test case starts with a line containing space-separated integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 3000$$$) — numbers of Algoland cities and number of Berland cities correspondingly.The next line contains $$$b$$$ space-separated integers $$$r_1, r_2, \\\\dots, r_b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le r_b \\\\le a$$$) where $$$r_j$$$ is the number of freeways, that should start in the $$$j$$$-th Berland city. It is guaranteed that $$$r_1+r_2+\\\\dots+r_b=a+b-1$$$.The next $$$a$$$ lines contain coordinates of the Algoland cities — pairs of space-separated integers $$$xa_i, ya_i$$$ ($$$-10000 \\\\le xa_i, ya_i \\\\le 10000$$$). The next $$$b$$$ lines contain coordinates of the Berland cities — pairs of space-separated integers $$$xb_i, yb_i$$$ ($$$-10000 \\\\le xb_i, yb_i \\\\le 10000$$$). All cities are located at distinct points, no three of the $$$a+b$$$ cities lie on a single straight line.Sum of values $$$a$$$ across all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3000$$$. Sum of values $$$b$$$ across all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3000$$$.OutputFor each of the $$$t$$$ test cases, first print \"YES\" if there is an answer or \"NO\" otherwise.If there is an answer, print the freeway building plan in the next $$$a+b-1$$$ lines. Each line of the plan should contain two space-separated integers $$$j$$$ and $$$i$$$ which means that a freeway from the $$$j$$$-th Berland city to the $$$i$$$-th Algoland city should be built. If there are multiple solutions, print any.ExampleInput22 31 1 20 01 11 23 24 01 110 00 1OutputYES2 21 23 23 1YES1 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d890e8a3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two sets of cities: $a$ Algoland cities and $b$ Berland cities.
