George and Interesting Graphtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutGeorge loves graphs. Most of all, he loves interesting graphs. We will assume that a directed graph isinteresting, if it meets the following criteria:The graph doesn't contain any multiple arcs;There is vertexv(we'll call her thecenter), such that for any vertex of graphu, the graph contains arcs(u,v)and(v,u). Please note that the graph also contains loop(v,v).The outdegree of all vertexes except for thecenterequals two and the indegree of all vertexes except for thecenterequals two. The outdegree of vertexuis the number of arcs that go out ofu, the indegree of vertexuis the number of arcs that go inu. Please note that the graph can contain loops.However, not everything's that simple. George got a directed graph ofnvertices andmarcs as a present. The graph didn't have any multiple arcs. As George loves interesting graphs, he wants to slightly alter the presented graph and transform it into an interesting one. In one alteration he can either remove an arbitrary existing arc from the graph or add an arbitrary arc to the graph.George wonders: what is the minimum number of changes that he needs to obtain an interesting graph from the graph he's got as a present? Help George and find the answer to the question.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandm(2 ≤n≤ 500, 1 ≤m≤ 1000) — the number of vertices and arcs in the presented graph.Each of the nextmlines contains two space-separated integersai,bi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n) — the descriptions of the graph's arcs. Pair(ai,bi)means that the graph contains an arc from vertex numberaito vertex numberbi. It is guaranteed that the presented graph doesn't contain multiple arcs.Assume that the grah vertices are numbered 1 throughn.OutputPrint a single integer — the answer to George's question.ExamplesInput3 71 12 23 11 33 22 33 3Output0Input3 61 12 23 13 22 33 3Output1Input3 12 2Output6NoteFor more information about directed graphs, please visit:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graphIn the first sample the graph already is interesting, its center is vertex3.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "294af93d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a directed graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.  \n\nA graph is considered \"interesting\" if it meets the following conditions:\n\n* There are no multiple edges between any two vertices.\n* There exists a vertex $v$ (the \"center\") such that for every vertex $u$ in the graph, there are edges $(u,v)$ and $(v,u)$.
