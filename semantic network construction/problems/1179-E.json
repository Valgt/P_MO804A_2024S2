Alesya and Discrete Mathtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWe call a functiongoodif its domain of definition is some set of integers and if in case it's defined in $$$x$$$ and $$$x-1$$$, $$$f(x) = f(x-1) + 1$$$ or $$$f(x) = f(x-1)$$$.Tanya has found $$$n$$$goodfunctions $$$f_{1}, \\\\ldots, f_{n}$$$, which are defined on all integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$10^{18}$$$ and $$$f_i(0) = 0$$$ and $$$f_i(10^{18}) = L$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. It's an notorious coincidence that $$$n$$$ is a divisor of $$$L$$$.She suggests Alesya a game. Using one question Alesya can ask Tanya a value of any single function in any single point. To win Alesya must choose integers $$$l_{i}$$$ and $$$r_{i}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq l_{i} \\\\leq r_{i} \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$), such that $$$f_{i}(r_{i}) - f_{i}(l_{i}) \\\\geq \\\\frac{L}{n}$$$ (here $$$f_i(x)$$$ means the value of $$$i$$$-th function at point $$$x$$$) for all $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$ so that for any pair of two functions their segments $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$ don't intersect (but may have one common point).Unfortunately, Tanya doesn't allow to make more than $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^{5}$$$ questions. Help Alesya to win!It can be proved that it's always possible to choose $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$ which satisfy the conditions described above.It's guaranteed, that Tanya doesn't change functions during the game, i.e. interactor is not adaptiveInputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$L$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1000$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq L \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$, $$$n$$$ is a divisor of $$$L$$$)  — number of functions and their value in $$$10^{18}$$$.OutputWhen you've found needed $$$l_i, r_i$$$, print $$$\"!\"$$$ without quotes on a separate line and then $$$n$$$ lines, $$$i$$$-th from them should contain two integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ divided by space.InteractionTo ask $$$f_i(x)$$$, print symbol \"?\" without quotes and then two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$). Note, you must flush your output to get a response.After that, you should read an integer which is a value of $$$i$$$-th function in point $$$x$$$.You're allowed not more than $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ questions.To flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line):fflush(stdout) in C++;System.out.flush() in Java;stdout.flush() in Python;flush(output) in Pascal;See the documentation for other languages.Hacks:Only tests where $$$1 \\\\leq L \\\\leq 2000$$$ are allowed for hacks, for a hack set a test using following format:The first line should contain two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$L$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1000$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq L \\\\leq 2000$$$, $$$n$$$ is a divisor of $$$L$$$)  — number of functions and their value in $$$10^{18}$$$.Each of $$$n$$$ following lines should contain $$$L$$$ numbers $$$l_1$$$, $$$l_2$$$, ... , $$$l_L$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq l_j < 10^{18}$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq L$$$ and $$$l_j < l_{j+1}$$$ for all $$$1 < j \\\\leq L$$$), in $$$i$$$-th of them $$$l_j$$$ means that $$$f_i(l_j) < f_i(l_j + 1)$$$.ExampleInput5 5 ? 1 0 ? 1 1 ? 2 1 ? 2 2 ? 3 2 ? 3 3 ? 4 3 ? 4 4 ? 5 4 ? 5 5 ! 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5Output0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 5NoteIn the example Tanya has $$$5$$$ same functions where $$$f(0) = 0$$$, $$$f(1) = 1$$$, $$$f(2) = 2$$$, $$$f(3) = 3$$$, $$$f(4) = 4$$$ and all remaining points have value $$$5$$$.Alesya must choose two integers for all functions so that difference of values of a function in its points is not less than $$$\\\\frac{L}{n}$$$ (what is $$$1$$$ here) and length of intersection of segments is zero.One possible way is to choose pairs $$$[0$$$, $$$1]$$$, $$$[1$$$, $$$2]$$$, $$$[2$$$, $$$3]$$$, $$$[3$$$, $$$4]$$$ and $$$[4$$$, $$$5]$$$ for functions $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ respectively.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "feaa7324", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ functions, $f_1, f_2, ..., f_n$.
