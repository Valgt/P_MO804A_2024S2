I Wanna Be the Guytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThere is a game called \"I Wanna Be the Guy\", consisting ofnlevels. Little X and his friend Little Y are addicted to the game. Each of them wants to pass the whole game.Little X can pass onlyplevels of the game. And Little Y can pass onlyqlevels of the game. You are given the indices of levels Little X can pass and the indices of levels Little Y can pass. Will Little X and Little Y pass the whole game, if they cooperate each other?InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 100).The next line contains an integerp(0 ≤p≤n)at first, then followspdistinct integersa1,a2, ...,ap(1 ≤ai≤n). These integers denote the indices of levels Little X can pass. The next line contains the levels Little Y can pass in the same format. It's assumed that levels are numbered from 1 ton.OutputIf they can pass all the levels, print \"I become the guy.\".
