Nikita and Order Statisticstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNikita likes tasks on order statistics, for example, he can easily find the $$$k$$$-th number in increasing order on a segment of an array. But now Nikita wonders how many segments of an array there are such that a given number $$$x$$$ is the $$$k$$$-th number in increasing order on this segment. In other words, you should find the number of segments of a given array such that there are exactly $$$k$$$ numbers of this segment which are less than $$$x$$$.Nikita wants to get answer for this question for each $$$k$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$, where $$$n$$$ is the size of the array.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5, -10^9 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^9)$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(-10^9 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9)$$$ — the given array.OutputPrint $$$n+1$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th number is the answer for Nikita's question for $$$k=i-1$$$.ExamplesInput5 31 2 3 4 5Output6 5 4 0 0 0Input2 6-5 9Output1 2 0Input6 99-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1Output0 6 5 4 3 2 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5ef32bad", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an array of $n$ integers and a target integer $x$, find the number of subarrays for each $k$ from 0 to $n-1$ where $x$ is the $k$-th smallest element in that subarray. \n\nIn other words, for each $k$, count the number of subarrays where there are exactly $k$ elements in the subarray that are smaller than $x$. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any part of this!"}, {"prompt_md5": "2b3c631c", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given an array of numbers and a target number, count how many segments of the array have the target number as the k-th smallest number in the segment, for k ranging from 0 to the length of the array."}]}
