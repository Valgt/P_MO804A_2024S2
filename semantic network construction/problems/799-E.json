Aquarium decorationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputArkady and Masha want to choose decorations for thier aquarium in Fishdom game. They havendecorations to choose from, each of them has some cost. To complete a task Arkady and Masha need to chooseexactlymdecorations from given, and they want to spend as little money as possible.There is one difficulty: Masha likes someaof the given decorations, Arkady likes somebof the given decorations. Some decorations may be liked by both Arkady and Masha, or not be liked by both. The friends want to choose such decorations so that each of them likesat leastkdecorations among the chosen. Help Masha and Arkady find the minimum sum of money they need to spend.InputThe first line contains three integersn,mandk(1 ≤n≤ 200000,1 ≤m≤n,1 ≤k≤n) — the number of decorations, how many decorations the friends should choose, how many decorations each of them should like among the chosen.The second line containsnintegersc1,c2, ...,cn(1 ≤ci≤ 109) — decorations costs.The third line contains single integera(1 ≤a≤n) — the number of decorations liked by Masha. The fourth line containsadistinct integersx1,x2, ...,xa(1 ≤xi≤n) — the ids of decorations liked by Masha.The next two lines describe decorations liked by Arkady in the same format.OutputPrint single integer: the minimum sum of money the friends should spend to fulfill all constraints.
