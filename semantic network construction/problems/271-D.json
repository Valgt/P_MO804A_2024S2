Two substringss[x...y]ands[p...q]are considered distinct if their content is different, i.e.s[x...y] ≠s[p...q].InputThe first line of the input is the non-empty strings, consisting of small English letters, the string's length is at most1500characters.The second line of the input is the string of characters \"0\" and \"1\", the length is exactly 26 characters. If thei-th character of this string equals \"1\", then thei-th English letter is good, otherwise it's bad. That is, the first character of this string corresponds to letter \"a\", the second one corresponds to letter \"b\" and so on.The third line of the input consists a single integerk(0 ≤k≤ |s|) — the maximum acceptable number of bad characters in a good substring.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of distinct good substrings of strings.ExamplesInputababab010000000000000000000000001Output5Inputacbacbacaa000000000000000000000000002Output8NoteIn the first example there are following good substrings: \"a\", \"ab\", \"b\", \"ba\", \"bab\".In the second example there are following good substrings: \"a\", \"aa\", \"ac\", \"b\", \"ba\", \"c\", \"ca\", \"cb\".", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e4617ebe", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string of lowercase English letters and a string of 26 characters, where each character represents whether the corresponding letter is \"good\" (1) or \"bad\" (0). \n\nYou need to find the number of distinct substrings within the given string where the number of \"bad\" letters is at most  *k*. \n\n**Input:**\n\n* Line 1: The string of lowercase English letters.\n* Line 2: A string of 26 characters, \"0\" or \"1\", indicating whether each letter is bad or good.\n* Line 3: An integer *k*, representing the maximum allowed number of bad letters in a substring.\n\n**Output:**\n\n* A single integer representing the number of distinct good substrings."}, {"prompt_md5": "4a3ee19d", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a string of letters and a list of which letters are \"good\" and which are \"bad\".
