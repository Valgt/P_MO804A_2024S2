Regular Bracket Sequencestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA bracket sequence is a string containing only characters \"(\" and \")\". A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"1\" and \"+\" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences \"()()\" and \"(())\" are regular (the resulting expressions are: \"(1)+(1)\" and \"((1+1)+1)\"), and \")(\", \"(\" and \")\" are not.You are given an integer $$$n$$$.

All bracket sequences you output for a testcase should be different (though they may repeat in different test cases). If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
