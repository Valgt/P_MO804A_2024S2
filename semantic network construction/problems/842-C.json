Ilya And The Treetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIlya is very fond of graphs, especially trees. During his last trip to the forest Ilya found a very interesting tree rooted at vertex1. There is an integer number written on each vertex of the tree; the number written on vertexiis equal toai.Ilya believes that the beauty of the vertexxis the greatest common divisor of all numbers written on the vertices on the path from the root tox, including this vertex itself. In addition, Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to0or leave all vertices unchanged. Now for each vertex Ilya wants to know the maximum possible beauty it can have.For each vertex the answer must be considered independently.The beauty of the root equals to number written on it.InputFirst line contains one integer numbern— the number of vertices in tree (1 ≤n≤ 2·105).Next line containsninteger numbersai(1 ≤i≤n,1 ≤ai≤ 2·105).Each of nextn- 1lines contains two integer numbersxandy(1 ≤x,y≤n,x≠y), which means that there is an edge(x,y)in the tree.OutputOutputnnumbers separated by spaces, wherei-th number equals to maximum possible beauty of vertexi.ExamplesInput26 21 2Output6 6Input36 2 31 21 3Output6 6 6Input110Output10", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "dfef8c22", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ vertices, each labeled with an integer $a_i$ (where $1 \\le i \\le n$).
