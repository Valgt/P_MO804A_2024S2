Bingotime limit per test7 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGetting ready for VK Fest 2021, you prepared a table with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns, and filled each cell of this table with some event related with the festival that could either happen or not: for example, whether you will win a prize on the festival, or whether it will rain.Forecasting algorithms used in VK have already estimated the probability for each event to happen. Event in row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ will happen with probability $$$a_{i, j} \\\\cdot 10^{-4}$$$. All of the events are mutually independent.Let's call the tablewinningif there exists a line such that all $$$n$$$ events on it happen. The line could be any horizontal line (cells $$$(i, 1), (i, 2), \\\\ldots, (i, n)$$$ for some $$$i$$$), any vertical line (cells $$$(1, j), (2, j), \\\\ldots, (n, j)$$$ for some $$$j$$$), the main diagonal (cells $$$(1, 1), (2, 2), \\\\ldots, (n, n)$$$), or the antidiagonal (cells $$$(1, n), (2, n - 1), \\\\ldots, (n, 1)$$$).Find the probability of your table to be winning, and output it modulo $$$31\\\\,607$$$ (see Output section).InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 21$$$) — the dimensions of the table.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \\\\ldots, a_{i, n}$$$ ($$$0 < a_{i, j} < 10^4$$$). The probability of event in cell $$$(i, j)$$$ to happen is $$$a_{i, j} \\\\cdot 10^{-4}$$$.OutputPrint the probability that your table will be winning, modulo $$$31\\\\,607$$$.Formally, let $$$M = 31\\\\,607$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\\\not \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\\\cdot q^{-1} \\\\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\\\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\\\cdot q \\\\equiv p \\\\pmod{M}$$$.ExamplesInput2 5000 5000 5000 5000Output5927Input2 2500 6000 3000 4000Output24812Input3 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000Output25267NoteIn the first example, any two events form a line, and the table will be winning if any two events happen.
