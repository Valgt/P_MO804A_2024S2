Consecutive Sum Riddletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTheofanis has a riddle for you and if you manage to solve it, he will give you a Cypriot snack halloumi for free (Cypriot cheese).You are given an integer $$$n$$$. You need to find two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$-10^{18} \\\\le l < r \\\\le 10^{18}$$$ and $$$l + (l + 1) + \\\\ldots + (r - 1) + r = n$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{18}$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$-10^{18} \\\\le l < r \\\\le 10^{18}$$$ and $$$l + (l + 1) + \\\\ldots + (r - 1) + r = n$$$.It can be proven that an answer always exists. If there are multiple answers, print any.ExampleInput7 1 2 3 6 100 25 3000000000000Output0 1 -1 2  1 2  1 3  18 22 -2 7 999999999999 1000000000001NoteIn the first test case, $$$0 + 1 = 1$$$.In the second test case, $$$(-1) + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2$$$.In the fourth test case, $$$1 + 2 + 3 = 6$$$.In the fifth test case, $$$18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 = 100$$$.In the sixth test case, $$$(-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 25$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "80b14513", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$.
