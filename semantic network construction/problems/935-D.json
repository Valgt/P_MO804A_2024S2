Fafa and Ancient Alphabettime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAncient Egyptians are known to have used a large set of symbolsto write on the walls of the temples. Fafa and Fifa went to one of the temples and found two non-empty wordsS1andS2of equal lengths on the wall of temple written one below the other. Since this temple is very ancient, some symbols from the words were erased. The symbols in the sethave equal probability for being in the position of any erased symbol.Fifa challenged Fafa to calculate the probability thatS1is lexicographically greater thanS2. Can you help Fafa with this task?You know that, i. e. there weremdistinct characters in Egyptians' alphabet, in this problem these characters are denoted by integers from1tomin alphabet order. A wordxis lexicographically greater than a wordyof the same length, if the words are same up to some position, and then the wordxhas a larger character, than the wordy.We can prove that the probability equals to some fraction, wherePandQare coprime integers, and. Print as the answer the value, i. e. such a non-negative integer less than109+ 7, such that, wheremeans thataandbgive the same remainders when divided bym.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 105) — the length of each of the two words and the size of the alphabet, respectively.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(0 ≤ai≤m) — the symbols ofS1. Ifai= 0, then the symbol at positioniwas erased.The third line containsnintegers representingS2with the same format asS1.OutputPrint the value, wherePandQare coprime andis the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput1 201Output500000004Input1 210Output0Input7 260 15 12 9 13 0 1411 1 0 13 15 12 0Output230769233NoteIn the first sample, the first word can be converted into (1) or (2). The second option is the only one that will make it lexicographically larger than the second word. So, the answer to the problem will be, that is500000004, because.In the second example, there is no replacement for the zero in the second word that will make the first one lexicographically larger. So, the answer to the problem is, that is0.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d3916cd6", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two words of equal length,  $S_1$ and $S_2$, each consisting of integers from 1 to $m$.
