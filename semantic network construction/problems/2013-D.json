However, he could not solve it either, so we ask you to try to solve this problem.You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. We can perform any number (possibly, zero) of operations on the array.In one operation, we choose a position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n - 1$$$) and perform the following action:$$$a_i := a_i - 1$$$, and $$$a_{i+1} := a_{i+1} + 1$$$.Find the minimum possible value of $$$\\\\max(a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n) - \\\\min(a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n)$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^{12}$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer: the minimum possible value of $$$\\\\max(a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n) - \\\\min(a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n)$$$.ExampleInput51131 2 344 1 2 344 2 3 155 14 4 10 2Output0 2 1 1 3NoteIn the third testcase, you can perform the operation twice with $$$i = 1$$$.After that, the array is $$$a = [2, 3, 2, 3]$$$, and $$$\\\\max(2, 3, 2, 3) - \\\\min(2, 3, 2, 3) = 3 - 2 = 1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e9688a59", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
