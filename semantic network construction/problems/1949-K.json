Make Triangletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n$$$ and three positive integers $$$n_a, n_b, n_c$$$ satisfying $$$n_a+n_b+n_c = n$$$.You want to split the $$$n$$$ positive integers into three groups, so that:The first group contains $$$n_a$$$ numbers, the second group contains $$$n_b$$$ numbers, the third group contains $$$n_c$$$ numbers.Let $$$s_a$$$ be the sum of the numbers in the first group, $$$s_b$$$ be the sum in the second group, and $$$s_c$$$ be the sum in the third group. Then $$$s_a, s_b, s_c$$$ are the sides of a triangle with positive area.Determine if this is possible. If this is possible, find one way to do so.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains the integers $$$n, n_a, n_b, n_c$$$ ($$$3 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 200\\\\,000, 1\\\\leq n_a,n_b,n_c \\\\leq n-2, n_a+n_b+n_c = n$$$) — the number of integers to split into three groups, and the desired sizes of the three groups.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq x_i \\\\leq 10^{9}$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$200\\\\,000$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$\\\\texttt{YES}$$$ if it is possible to split the numbers into three groups satisfying all the conditions. Otherwise, print $$$\\\\texttt{NO}$$$.If such a split exists, then describe the three groups as follows.On the next line, print $$$n_a$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{n_a}$$$ — the numbers in the first group.On the next line, print $$$n_b$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_{n_b}$$$ — the numbers in the second group.On the next line, print $$$n_c$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_{n_c}$$$ — the numbers in the third group.These $$$n_a+n_b+n_c=n$$$ integers should be a permutation of $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n$$$, and they should satisfy the conditions from the statement.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.ExampleInput46 2 2 21 1 1 1 1 15 3 1 11 1 1 1 16 2 2 21 1 1 1 1 38 1 2 516 1 1 1 1 1 1 12OutputYES 1 1  1 1  1 1  NO NO YES 16  12 1  1 1 1 1 1NoteIn thefirst test case, we can put two $$$1$$$s into each group: the sum in each group would be $$$2$$$, and there exists a triangle with positive area and sides $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$.In thesecond and third test cases, it can be shown that there is no such way to split numbers into groups.In thefourth test case, we can put number $$$16$$$ into the first group, with sum $$$16$$$, numbers $$$12$$$ and $$$1$$$ into the second group, with sum $$$13$$$, and the remaining five $$$1$$$s into the third group, with sum $$$5$$$, as there exists a triangle with positive area and sides $$$16, 13, 5$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d07c7823", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ positive integers $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ and three positive integers $n_a, n_b, n_c$ where $n_a + n_b + n_c = n$.\n\nYou need to split the $n$ integers into three groups:\n\n* Group 1: contains $n_a$ numbers\n* Group 2: contains $n_b$ numbers\n* Group 3: contains $n_c$ numbers\n\nLet $s_a$ be the sum of the numbers in Group 1, $s_b$ be the sum in Group 2, and $s_c$ be the sum in Group 3.\n\nDetermine if it's possible to split the numbers so that $s_a$, $s_b$, and $s_c$ form the sides of a triangle with positive area.\n\nIf it's possible, output \"YES\" and list the numbers in each group.
