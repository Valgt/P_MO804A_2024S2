The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ representing the array $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^4$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" if such $$$b$$$ exists, otherwise output \"NO\".
