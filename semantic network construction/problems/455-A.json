One long winter evening he came up with a game and decided to play it.Given a sequenceaconsisting ofnintegers. The player can make several steps. In a single step he can choose an element of the sequence (let's denote itak) and delete it, at that all elements equal toak+ 1andak- 1also must be deleted from the sequence. That step bringsakpoints to the player.Alex is a perfectionist, so he decided to get as many points as possible. Help him.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105) that shows how many numbers are in Alex's sequence.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 105).OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum number of points that Alex can earn.ExamplesInput21 2Output2Input31 2 3Output4Input91 2 1 3 2 2 2 2 3Output10NoteConsider the third test example. At first step we need to choose any element equal to2. After that step our sequence looks like this[2, 2, 2, 2]. Then we do4steps, on each step we choose any element equals to2.
