Let $$$c$$$ be an array of length $$$n - k + 1$$$ such that $$$$$$c_i = \\\\max(p_i, \\\\dots, p_{i+k-1}) + \\\\min(p_i, \\\\dots, p_{i+k-1}).$$$$$$ Let thecostof the permutation $$$p$$$ be the maximum element of $$$c$$$.Koxia wants you to construct a permutation with the minimum possible cost.$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 2000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\\\dots,p_n$$$, which is a permutation with minimal cost. If there is more than one permutation with minimal cost, you may output any of them.ExampleInput35 35 16 6Output5 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 3 2 4 1 6 5NoteIn the first test case,$$$c_1 = \\\\max(p_1,p_2,p_3) + \\\\min(p_1,p_2,p_3) = 5 + 1 = 6$$$.$$$c_2 = \\\\max(p_2,p_3,p_4) + \\\\min(p_2,p_3,p_4) = 3 + 1 = 4$$$.$$$c_3 = \\\\max(p_3,p_4,p_5) + \\\\min(p_3,p_4,p_5) = 4 + 2 = 6$$$.Therefore, the cost is $$$\\\\max(6,4,6)=6$$$.
