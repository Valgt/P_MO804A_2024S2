The value(j-i+ 1)denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment ofa, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105).
