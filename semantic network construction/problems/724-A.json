Checking the Calendartime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given names of two days of the week.Please, determine whether it is possible that during somenon-leap yearthe first day of some month was equal to the first day of the week you are given, while the first day ofthe next monthwas equal to the second day of the week you are given.Both months should belong to one year.In this problem, we consider the Gregorian calendar to be used. The number of months in this calendar is equal to 12. The number of days in months during any non-leap year is:31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31.Names of the days of the week are given with lowercase English letters: \"monday\", \"tuesday\", \"wednesday\", \"thursday\", \"friday\", \"saturday\", \"sunday\".InputThe input consists of two lines, each of them containing the name of exactly one day of the week.
