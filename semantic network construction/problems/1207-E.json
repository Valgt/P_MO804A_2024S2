XOR Guessingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problem. Remember to flush your output while communicating with the testing program.You may usefflush(stdout)in C++,system.out.flush()in Java,stdout.flush()in Python orflush(output)in Pascal to flush the output. If you use some other programming language, consult its documentation. You may also refer to the guide on interactive problems:https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307.The jury picked an integer $$$x$$$ not less than $$$0$$$ and not greater than $$$2^{14} - 1$$$. You have to guess this integer.To do so, you may ask no more than $$$2$$$ queries. Each query should consist of $$$100$$$ integer numbers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_{100}$$$ (each integer should be not less than $$$0$$$ and not greater than $$$2^{14} - 1$$$). In response to your query, the jury will pick one integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le 100$$$) and tell you the value of $$$a_i \\\\oplus x$$$ (the bitwise XOR of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$x$$$). There is an additional constraint on the queries: all $$$200$$$ integers you use in the queries should be distinct.It is guaranteed that the value of $$$x$$$ is fixed beforehand in each test, but the choice of $$$i$$$ in every query may depend on the integers you send.OutputTo give the answer, your program should print one line $$$!$$$ $$$x$$$with a line break in the end. After that, it should flush the output and terminate gracefully.InteractionBefore giving the answer, you may submit no more than $$$2$$$ queries. To ask a query, print one line in the following format: $$$?$$$ $$$a_1$$$ $$$a_2$$$ ... $$$a_{100}$$$, where every $$$a_j$$$ should be an integer from the range $$$[0, 2^{14} - 1]$$$.The line should be ended with a line break character. After submitting a query, flush the output and read the answer to your query — the value of $$$a_i \\\\oplus x$$$ for some $$$i \\\\in [1, 100]$$$.No integer can be used in queries more than once.If you submit an incorrect query (or ask more than $$$2$$$ queries), the answer to it will be one integer $$$-1$$$. After receiving such an answer, your program should terminate immediately — otherwise you may receive verdict \"Runtime error\", \"Time limit exceeded\" or some other verdict instead of \"Wrong answer\".ExampleInput0 32Output? 3 5 6 ? 32 24 37 ! 5NoteThe example of interactionis not correct— you should sumbitexactly$$$100$$$ integers in each query.
