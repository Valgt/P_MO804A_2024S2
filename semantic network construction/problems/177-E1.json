On the first day on the planet the Beaver takes a walk and gets to know the citizens. On the second and all subsequent days the Beaver gives presents to the citizens — each of thebicitizens gets one present per day. The Beaver leaves the planet in the evening of the day when the number of presents left is strictly less than the number of citizens (i.e. as soon as he won't be able to give away the proper number of presents the next day). He leaves the remaining presents at the hotel.The Beaver is going to spend exactlycdays traveling. The time spent on flights between the planets is considered to be zero. In how many ways can one choose the positive integerxso that the planned voyage will take exactlycdays?InputThe first input line contains space-separated integersnandc— the number of planets that the Beaver is going to visit and the number of days he is going to spend traveling, correspondingly.The nextnlines contain pairs of space-separated integersai,bi(1 ≤i≤n) — the number of suitcases he can bring to thei-th planet and the number of citizens of thei-th planet, correspondingly.The input limitations for getting 30 points are:1 ≤n≤ 1001 ≤ai≤ 1001 ≤bi≤ 1001 ≤c≤ 100The input limitations for getting 100 points are:1 ≤n≤ 1040 ≤ai≤ 1091 ≤bi≤ 1091 ≤c≤ 109Due to possible overflow, it is recommended to use the 64-bit arithmetic. In some solutions even the 64-bit arithmetic can overflow. So be careful in calculations!OutputPrint a single numberk— the number of ways to choosexso as to travel for exactlycdays.

Then the Beaver takes 1 suitcase with 5 presents to the first planet. Here he spends 2 days: he hangs around on the first day, and he gives away five presents on the second day. He takes 2 suitcases with 10 presents to the second planet. Here he spends 3 days — he gives away 4 presents on the second and the third days and leaves the remaining 2 presents at the hotel. In total, the Beaver spends 5 days traveling.Forx= 4or less the Beaver won't have enough presents for the second day on the first planet, so the voyage will end too soon.
