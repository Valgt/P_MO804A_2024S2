Collecting Coinstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp has three sisters: Alice, Barbara, and Cerene. They're collecting coins. Currently, Alice has $$$a$$$ coins, Barbara has $$$b$$$ coins and Cerene has $$$c$$$ coins. Recently Polycarp has returned from the trip around the world and brought $$$n$$$ coins.He wants to distributeallthese $$$n$$$ coins between his sisters in such a way that the number of coins Alice has is equal to the number of coins Barbara has and is equal to the number of coins Cerene has. In other words, if Polycarp gives $$$A$$$ coins to Alice, $$$B$$$ coins to Barbara and $$$C$$$ coins to Cerene ($$$A+B+C=n$$$), then $$$a + A = b + B = c + C$$$.Notethat A, B or C (the number of coins Polycarp gives to Alice, Barbara and Cerene correspondingly) can be 0.Your task is to find out if it is possible to distributeall$$$n$$$ coins between sisters in a way described above.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a new line and consists of four space-separated integers $$$a, b, c$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b, c, n \\\\le 10^8$$$) — the number of coins Alice has, the number of coins Barbara has, the number of coins Cerene has and the number of coins Polycarp has.OutputFor each test case, print \"YES\" if Polycarp can distributeall$$$n$$$ coins between his sisters and \"NO\" otherwise.ExampleInput5 5 3 2 8 100 101 102 105 3 2 1 100000000 10 20 15 14 101 101 101 3OutputYES YES NO NO YES", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "16088006", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are three people with a certain number of coins each.
