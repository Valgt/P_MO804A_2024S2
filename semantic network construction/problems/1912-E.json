Evaluate It and Back Againtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAidan and Nadia are long-time friends with a shared passion for mathematics. Each of them has a favorite number: Aidan's favorite number is $$$p$$$, and Nadia's is $$$q$$$.To commemorate their friendship, their friends want to make a present: a plaque with an arithmetic expression whose value is equal to their favorite numbers. At first glance, it sounds impossible, but the answer is simple: Aidan readsleft-to-right, while Nadia readsright-to-left, so the same expression can have different values for them.For example, if2023-12-13is written on the plaque, then Aidan would calculate the result as $$$2023-12-13 = 1998$$$, and Nadia would calculate it as $$$31-21-3202=-3192$$$.Find an arithmetic expression that, when read left-to-right, evaluates to $$$p$$$, and, when read right-to-left, evaluates to $$$q$$$. Its length must be at most $$$1000$$$ characters. It's guaranteed that such an expression exists for all valid inputs.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$-10^{18} \\\\le p, q \\\\le 10^{18}$$$).OutputPrint the expression without spaces or line breaks. It can only contain digits 0 through 9, '+', '-', and '*' characters.The expression must contain at most $$$1000$$$ characters. Leading zeros in numbers are not allowed (the only exception is the notation '0' representing the number $$$0$$$) in both the expression and its reverse. Use of unary '+' or '-' is not allowed. The expression must be well-formed in both directions. The calculation uses the standard operator precedence.ExamplesInput1998 -3192Output2023-12-13Input413 908Output12*34+5", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6d0e7031", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given two integers $p$ and $q$, find an arithmetic expression (using only digits 0-9, +, -, *) that evaluates to $p$ when read left-to-right and to $q$ when read right-to-left.
