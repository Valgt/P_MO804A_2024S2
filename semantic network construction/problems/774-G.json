Perfectionist Arkadiytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputArkadiy has lots square photos with sizea×a. He wants to put some of them on a rectangular wall with sizeh×w.The photos which Arkadiy will put on the wall must form a rectangular grid and the distances between neighboring vertically and horizontally photos and also the distances between outside rows and columns of photos to the nearest bound of the wall must be equal tox, wherexis some non-negativerealnumber. Look on the picture below for better understanding of the statement.Arkadiy haven't chosen yet how many photos he would put on the wall, however, he want to put at least one photo. Your task is to determine theminimumvalue ofxwhich can be obtained after putting photos, or report that there is no way to put positive number of photos and satisfy all the constraints. Suppose that Arkadiy has enough photos to make any valid arrangement according to the constraints.Note that Arkadiy wants to put at least one photo on the wall. The photos should not overlap, should completely lie inside the wall bounds and should have sides parallel to the wall sides.InputThe first line contains three integersa,handw(1 ≤a,h,w≤ 109) — the size of photos and the height and the width of the wall.OutputPrint one non-negative real number — the minimum value ofxwhich can be obtained after putting the photos on the wall.
