Informatics in MACtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn the Master's Assistance Center, Nyam-Nyam was given a homework assignment in informatics.There is an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, and you want to divide it into $$$k > 1$$$ subsegments$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$ in such a way that the $$$\\\\operatorname{MEX} ^{\\\\ddagger}$$$ on each subsegment is equal to the same integer.Help Nyam-Nyam find any suitable division, or determine that it does not exist.$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$A division of an array into $$$k$$$ subsegments is defined as $$$k$$$ pairs of integers $$$(l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2), \\\\ldots, (l_k, r_k)$$$ such that $$$l_i \\\\le r_i$$$ and for each $$$1 \\\\le j \\\\le k - 1$$$, $$$l_{j + 1} = r_j + 1$$$, and also $$$l_1 = 1$$$ and $$$r_k = n$$$. These pairs represent the subsegments themselves.$$$^{\\\\ddagger}\\\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array.For example:$$$\\\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of the array $$$[2, 2, 1]$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the array.$$$\\\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of the array $$$[3, 1, 0, 1]$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the array, but $$$2$$$ does not.$$$\\\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of the array $$$[0, 3, 1, 2]$$$ is $$$4$$$, because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$ belong to the array, but $$$4$$$ does not.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i < n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer $$$-1$$$ if a suitable division does not exist.Otherwise, on the first line, output an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$) — the number of subsegments in the division.Then output $$$k$$$ lines — the division into subsegments. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le n$$$) — the boundaries of the $$$i$$$-th subsegment.The following conditions must be satisfied:For all $$$1 \\\\le j \\\\le k - 1$$$, $$$l_{j + 1} = r_j + 1$$$;$$$l_1 = 1$$$, $$$r_k = n$$$.If there are multiple possible solutions, output any of them.ExampleInput520 050 1 2 3 480 1 7 1 0 1 0 332 2 240 1 2 0Output2 1 1 2 2 -1 3 1 3 4 5 6 8 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 -1NoteIn the first test case, the array $$$a$$$ can be divided into $$$2$$$ subsegments with boundaries $$$[1, 1]$$$ and $$$[2, 2]$$$:$$$\\\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of the first subsegment $$$[0]$$$ is $$$1$$$, as $$$0$$$ belongs to the subsegment, but $$$1$$$ does not.$$$\\\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of the second subsegment $$$[0]$$$ is $$$1$$$, as $$$0$$$ belongs to the subsegment, but $$$1$$$ does not.In the second test case, it can be proven that the required division does not exist.In the third test case, the array $$$a$$$ can be divided into $$$3$$$ subsegments with boundaries $$$[1, 3]$$$, $$$[4, 5]$$$, $$$[6, 8]$$$:$$$\\\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of the first subsegment $$$[0, 1, 7]$$$ is $$$2$$$, as $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the subsegment, but $$$2$$$ does not.$$$\\\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of the second subsegment $$$[1, 0]$$$ is $$$2$$$, as $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the subsegment, but $$$2$$$ does not.$$$\\\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of the third subsegment $$$[1, 0, 3]$$$ is $$$2$$$, as $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the subsegment, but $$$2$$$ does not.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9440329e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
