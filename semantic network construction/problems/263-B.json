Squarestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutVasya has found a piece of paper with a coordinate system written on it. There arendistinct squares drawn in this coordinate system. Let's number the squares with integers from 1 ton. It turned out that points with coordinates(0, 0)and(ai,ai)are the opposite corners of thei-th square.Vasya wants to find such integer point (with integer coordinates) of the plane, that belongs to exactlykdrawn squares. We'll say that a point belongs to a square, if the point is located either inside the square, or on its boundary.Help Vasya find a point that would meet the described limits.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersn,k(1 ≤n,k≤ 50). The second line contains space-separated integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109).It is guaranteed that all given squares are distinct.OutputIn a single line print two space-separated integersxandy(0 ≤x,y≤ 109)— the coordinates of the point that belongs to exactlyksquares.
