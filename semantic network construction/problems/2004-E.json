Not a Nim Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTwo players, Alice and Bob, are playing a game. They have $$$n$$$ piles of stones, with the $$$i$$$-th pile initially containing $$$a_i$$$ stones.On their turn, a player can choose any pile of stones and take any positive number of stones from it, with one condition:let the current number of stones in the pile be $$$x$$$. It is not allowed to take from the pile a number of stones $$$y$$$ such that the greatest common divisor of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ is not equal to $$$1$$$.The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally (that is, if a player has a strategy that allows them to win, no matter how the opponent responds, they will win). Alice goes first.Determine who will win.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines:the first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$);the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^7$$$).Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, outputAliceif Alice wins, orBobif Bob wins.ExampleInput333 2 943 3 6 151 2 3 4 5OutputBob Alice Bob", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "015b83de", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ piles of stones.
