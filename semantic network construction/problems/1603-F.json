Shohag, a melancholic soul, made a strong determination that he will pursue Competitive Programming seriously, by heart, because he found it fascinating. Fast forward to 4 years, he is happy that he took this road. He is now creating a contest on Codeforces. He found an astounding problem but has no idea how to solve this. Help him to solve the final problem of the round.You are given three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$x$$$. Find the number, modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$, of integer sequences $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ such that the following conditions are satisfied:$$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\lt 2^k$$$ for each integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.There is no non-empty subsequence in $$$a$$$ such that thebitwise XORof the elements of the subsequence is $$$x$$$.A sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$c$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$c$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$)  — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^7$$$, $$$0 \\\\le x \\\\lt 2^{\\\\operatorname{min}(20, k)}$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^7$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the answer to the problem.ExampleInput6 2 2 0 2 1 1 3 2 3 69 69 69 2017 10 18 5 7 0Output6 1 15 699496932 892852568 713939942NoteIn the first test case, the valid sequences are $$$[1, 2]$$$, $$$[1, 3]$$$, $$$[2, 1]$$$, $$$[2, 3]$$$, $$$[3, 1]$$$ and $$$[3, 2]$$$.In the second test case, the only valid sequence is $$$[0, 0]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e3419a34", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given three integers $n$, $k$, and $x$.
