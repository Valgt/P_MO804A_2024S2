Yet Another Permutation Constructivetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSuppose you have a permutation $$$p$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers — an array where each element is an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once.In one operation, you removeeveryelement of this permutation which is less than at least one of its neighbors. For example, when you apply the operation to $$$[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]$$$, you get $$$[3, 5]$$$. If you apply an operation again, you get $$$[5]$$$.It's easy to see that after applying a finite number of operations, you get an array consisting of a single integer $$$n$$$.You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Find a permutation of $$$n$$$ integers such that it becomes an array consisting of a single element $$$n$$$ after exactly $$$k$$$ operations (and not earlier).InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n - 1$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer as follows:if a permutation of size $$$n$$$ which becomes an array consisting of a single element $$$n$$$ after exactly $$$k$$$ operations does not exist, print $$$-1$$$;otherwise, print $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ — the requested permutation. If there are multiple such permutations, print any of them.ExampleInput45 25 42 13 2Output3 1 2 5 4 -1 1 2 2 1 3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "143dc75a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two numbers,  $n$ and $k$.  \n\nFind a list of $n$ unique numbers from 1 to $n$ that, when repeatedly following these rules, will eventually become a list with only the number $n$ remaining:\n\n* **Rule:** Remove any number from the list if it is smaller than at least one of its neighbors.\n\nThe list must become a list with only $n$ after exactly $k$ steps.
