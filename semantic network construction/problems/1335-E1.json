Three Blocks Palindrome (easy version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.You are given a sequence $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers.Let's define athree blocks palindromeas the sequence, consisting ofat most twodistinct elements (let these elements are $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, $$$a$$$ can be equal $$$b$$$) and is as follows: $$$[\\\\underbrace{a, a, \\\\dots, a}_{x}, \\\\underbrace{b, b, \\\\dots, b}_{y}, \\\\underbrace{a, a, \\\\dots, a}_{x}]$$$. There $$$x, y$$$ are integers greater than or equal to $$$0$$$. For example, sequences $$$[]$$$, $$$[2]$$$, $$$[1, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 2, 1]$$$ and $$$[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]$$$ arethree block palindromesbut $$$[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]$$$ and $$$[1, 2]$$$ are not.Your task is to choose the maximum by lengthsubsequenceof $$$a$$$ that is athree blocks palindrome.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.Recall that the sequence $$$t$$$ is a a subsequence of the sequence $$$s$$$ if $$$t$$$ can be derived from $$$s$$$ by removing zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, if $$$s=[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$$$, then possible subsequences are: $$$[1, 1, 1, 1]$$$, $$$[3]$$$ and $$$[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$$$, but not $$$[3, 2, 3]$$$ and $$$[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2000$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 26$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.Note that the maximum value of $$$a_i$$$ can be up to $$$26$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 2000$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — the maximum possible length of some subsequence of $$$a$$$ that is athree blocks palindrome.ExampleInput6 8 1 1 2 2 3 2 1 1 3 1 3 3 4 1 10 10 1 1 26 2 2 1 3 1 1 1Output7 2 4 1 1 3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "105a550b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of numbers.
