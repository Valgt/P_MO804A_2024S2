Magic Squarestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe Smart Beaver from ABBYY loves puzzles. One of his favorite puzzles is the magic square. He has recently had an idea to automate the solution of this puzzle. The Beaver decided to offer this challenge to the ABBYY Cup contestants.The magic square is a matrix of sizen×n. The elements of this matrix are integers. The sum of numbers in each row of the matrix is equal to some numbers. The sum of numbers in each column of the matrix is also equal tos. In addition, the sum of the elements on the main diagonal is equal tosand the sum of elements on the secondary diagonal is equal tos. Examples of magic squares are given in the following figure:Magic squaresYou are given a set ofn2integersai. It is required to place these numbers into a square matrix of sizen×nso that they form a magic square. Note that each number must occur in the matrix exactly the same number of times as it occurs in the original set.It is guaranteed that a solution exists!InputThe first input line contains a single integern. The next line containsn2integersai(- 108≤ai≤ 108), separated by single spaces.The input limitations for getting 20 points are:1 ≤n≤ 3The input limitations for getting 50 points are:1 ≤n≤ 4It is guaranteed that there are no more than 9 distinct numbers amongai.The input limitations for getting 100 points are:1 ≤n≤ 4OutputThe first line of the output should contain a single integers. In each of the followingnlines printnintegers, separated by spaces and describing the resulting magic square. In the resulting magic square the sums in the rows, columns and diagonals must be equal tos. If there are multiple solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput31 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Output152 7 69 5 14 3 8Input31 0 -1 0 2 -1 -2 0 1Output01 0 -1-2 0 21 0 -1Input25 5 5 5Output105 55 5", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "505089a3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of $n^2$ integers $a_i$.
