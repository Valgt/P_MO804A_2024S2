For each query you are given the integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{18}$$$).OutputPrint the answer for each query on a new line. If it is impossible to obtain $$$1$$$ from $$$n$$$, print-1. Otherwise, print the minimum number of moves required to do it.ExampleInput7 1 10 25 30 14 27 1000000000000000000Output0 4 6 6 -1 6 72", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a570afe3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a number $n$.
