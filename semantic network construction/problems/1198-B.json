Welfare Statetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a country with $$$n$$$ citizens. The $$$i$$$-th of them initially has $$$a_{i}$$$ money. The government strictly controls the wealth of its citizens. Whenever a citizen makes a purchase or earns some money, they must send a receipt to the social services mentioning the amount of money they currently have.Sometimes the government makes payouts to the poor: all citizens who have strictly less money than $$$x$$$ are paid accordingly so that after the payout they have exactly $$$x$$$ money. In this case the citizens don't send a receipt.You know the initial wealth of every citizen and the log of all events: receipts and payouts. Restore the amount of money each citizen has after all events.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^{5}$$$) — the numer of citizens.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_{i} \\\\le 10^{9}$$$) — the initial balances of citizens.The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^{5}$$$) — the number of events.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains a single event. The events are given in chronological order.Each event is described as either1 p x($$$1 \\\\le p \\\\le n$$$, $$$0 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^{9}$$$), or2 x($$$0 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^{9}$$$). In the first case we have a receipt that the balance of the $$$p$$$-th person becomes equal to $$$x$$$. In the second case we have a payoff with parameter $$$x$$$.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers — the balances of all citizens after all events.ExamplesInput4 1 2 3 4 3 2 3 1 2 2 2 1Output3 2 3 4Input5 3 50 2 1 10 3 1 2 0 2 8 1 3 20Output8 8 20 8 10NoteIn the first example the balances change as follows:1 2 3 4$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$3 3 3 4$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$3 2 3 4$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$3 2 3 4In the second example the balances change as follows:3 50 2 1 10$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$3 0 2 1 10$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$8 8 8 8 10$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$8 8 20 8 10", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ac6b216b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ people.
