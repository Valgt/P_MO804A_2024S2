Sakurako's Examtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputToday, Sakurako has a math exam. The teacher gave the array, consisting of $$$a$$$ ones and $$$b$$$ twos.In an array, Sakurakomustplace either a '+' or a '-' in front of each element so that the sum of all elements in the array equals $$$0$$$.Sakurako is not sure if it is possible to solve this problem, so determine whether there is a way to assign signs such that the sum of all elements in the array equals $$$0$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 100$$$)  — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$0\\\\le a,b<10$$$)  — the number of '1's and the number of '2's in the array.OutputFor each test case, output \"Yes\" if you can make the sum of the entire array equal to $$$0$$$, and \"No\" otherwise.You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be accepted as a positive answer.ExampleInput50 10 32 02 33 1OutputNO NO YES YES NONote$$$a=0$$$, $$$b=1$$$: This means the array is $$$[2]$$$ — it is impossible to add the signs '+' or '-' to get $$$0$$$ as a result;$$$a=0$$$, $$$b=3$$$: This means the array is $$$[2, 2, 2]$$$ — it is impossible to add the signs '+' or '-' to get $$$0$$$ as a result;$$$a=2$$$, $$$b=0$$$: This means the array is $$$[1, 1]$$$ — it is possible to add the signs '+' or '-' to get $$$0$$$ as a result ($$$+1-1=0$$$);$$$a=2$$$, $$$b=3$$$: This means the array is $$$[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]$$$ — it is possible to add the signs '+' or '-' to get $$$0$$$ as a result ($$$+1+1-2-2+2=0$$$);", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b94e91a6", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a set of numbers, some are 1s and some are 2s.
