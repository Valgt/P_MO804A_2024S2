The rules of this game are quite simple:The game starts withnpiles of stones indexed from1ton. Thei-th pile containssistones.The players make their moves alternatively. A move is considered as removal of some number of stones from a pile. Removal of0stones does not count as a move.The player who is unable to make a move loses.Now Jon believes that he is ready for battle, but Sam does not think so. To prove his argument, Sam suggested that they play a modified version of the game.In this modified version, no move can be made more than once on a pile. For example, if4stones are removed from a pile,4stones cannot be removed from that pile again.Sam sets up the game and makes the first move. Jon believes that Sam is just trying to prevent him from going to battle. Jon wants to know if he can win if both play optimally.InputFirst line consists of a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 106) — the number of piles.Each of nextnlines contains an integersi(1 ≤si≤ 60) — the number of stones ini-th pile.OutputPrint a single line containing \"YES\" (without quotes) if Jon wins, otherwise print \"NO\" (without quotes)ExamplesInput15OutputNOInput212OutputYESNoteIn the first case, Sam removes all the stones and Jon loses.In second case, the following moves are possible by Sam:In each of these cases, last move can be made by Jon to win the game as follows:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "87064866", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ piles of stones.
