Vika and Segmentstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVika has an infinite sheet of squared paper. Initially all squares are white. She introduced a two-dimensional coordinate system on this sheet and drewnblack horizontal and vertical segments parallel to the coordinate axes. All segments have width equal to1square, that means every segment occupy some set of neighbouring squares situated in one row or one column.Your task is to calculate the number of painted cells. If a cell was painted more than once, it should be calculated exactly once.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 100 000) — the number of segments drawn by Vika.Each of the nextnlines contains four integersx1,y1,x2andy2(- 109≤x1,y1,x2,y2≤ 109) — the coordinates of the endpoints of the segments drawn by Vika. It is guaranteed that all the segments are parallel to coordinate axes. Segments may touch, overlap and even completely coincide.OutputPrint the number of cells painted by Vika. If a cell was painted more than once, it should be calculated exactly once in the answer.ExamplesInput30 1 2 11 4 1 20 3 2 3Output8Input4-2 -1 2 -12 1 -2 1-1 -2 -1 21 2 1 -2Output16NoteIn the first sample Vika will paint squares(0, 1),(1, 1),(2, 1),(1, 2),(1, 3),(1, 4),(0, 3)and(2, 3).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e288a493", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a grid of squares.  \n\nYou are given a list of horizontal and vertical lines that intersect the grid.
