Boboniu Chats with Dutime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputHave you ever used the chat application QQ? Well, in a chat group of QQ, administrators can muzzle a user for days.In Boboniu's chat group, there's a person called Du Yi who likes to make fun of Boboniu every day.Du will chat in the group for $$$n$$$ days. On the $$$i$$$-th day:If Du can speak, he'll make fun of Boboniu with fun factor $$$a_i$$$. But after that, he may be muzzled depending on Boboniu's mood.Otherwise, Du won't do anything.Boboniu's mood is a constant $$$m$$$. On the $$$i$$$-th day:If Du can speak and $$$a_i>m$$$, then Boboniu will be angry and muzzle him for $$$d$$$ days, which means that Du won't be able to speak on the $$$i+1, i+2, \\\\cdots, \\\\min(i+d,n)$$$-th days.Otherwise, Boboniu won't do anything.The total fun factor is the sum of the fun factors on the days when Du can speak.Du asked you to find the maximum total fun factor among all possible permutations of $$$a$$$.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$d$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\\\\le d\\\\le n\\\\le 10^5,0\\\\le m\\\\le 10^9$$$).The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0\\\\le a_i\\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint one integer: the maximum total fun factor among all permutations of $$$a$$$.ExamplesInput5 2 11 8 10 15 23 5Output48Input20 2 16 20 5 8 2 18 16 2 16 16 1 5 16 2 13 6 16 4 17 21 7Output195NoteIn the first example, you can set $$$a'=[15, 5, 8, 10, 23]$$$. Then Du's chatting record will be:Make fun of Boboniu with fun factor $$$15$$$.Be muzzled.Be muzzled.Make fun of Boboniu with fun factor $$$10$$$.Make fun of Boboniu with fun factor $$$23$$$.Thus the total fun factor is $$$48$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2e870e05", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, representing the fun factor of a person's jokes on each of $n$ days.  \n\nOn each day $i$, if $a_i > m$, the person will be muzzled for $d$ days starting from the next day.
