Cookie Clickertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutKostya is playing the computer game Cookie Clicker. The goal of this game is to gather cookies. You can get cookies using differentbuildings: you can just click a special field on the screen and get the cookies for the clicks, you can buy a cookie factory, an alchemy lab, a time machine and it all will bring lots and lots of cookies.At the beginning of the game (time 0), Kostya has 0 cookies and no buildings. He hasnavailable buildings to choose from: thei-th building is worthcicookies and when it's built it bringsvicookies at the end of each second. Also, to make the game more interesting to play, Kostya decided to add a limit: at each moment of time, he can use only one building. Of course, he can change the active building each second at his discretion.It's important that Kostya is playing a version of the game where he can buy new buildings and change active building only at time moments that are multiples of one second. Kostya can buy new building and use it at the same time. If Kostya starts to use a building at the time momentt, he can get the first profit from it only at the time momentt+ 1.Kostya wants to earn at leastscookies as quickly as possible. Determine the number of seconds he needs to do that.InputThe first line contains two integersnands(1 ≤n≤ 2·105,1 ≤s≤ 1016) — the number of buildings in the game and the number of cookies Kostya wants to earn.Each of the nextnlines contains two integersviandci(1 ≤vi≤ 108,0 ≤ci≤ 108) — the number of cookies thei-th building brings per second and the building's price.OutputOutput the only integer — the minimum number of seconds Kostya needs to earn at leastscookies. It is guaranteed that he can do it.ExamplesInput3 91 02 35 4Output6Input3 61 02 25 4Output5Input3 131 02 26 5Output7Input1 100000000000000001 0Output10000000000000000", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e0e81c99", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ buildings available, each with a cost $c_i$ and a cookie production rate of $v_i$ per second.
