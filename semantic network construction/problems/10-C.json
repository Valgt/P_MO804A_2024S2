Digital Roottime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutNot long ago Billy came across such a problem, where there were given three natural numbersA,BandCfrom the range[1,N], and it was asked to check whether the equationAB=Cis correct. Recently Billy studied the concept of a digital root of a number. We should remind you that a digital rootd(x)of the numberxis the sums(x)of all the digits of this number, ifs(x) ≤ 9, otherwise it isd(s(x)). For example, a digital root of the number 6543 is calculated as follows:d(6543) =d(6 + 5 + 4 + 3) =d(18) = 9. Billy has counted that the digital root of a product of numbers is equal to the digital root of the product of the factors' digital roots, i.e.d(xy) =d(d(x)d(y)). And the following solution to the problem came to his mind: to calculate the digital roots and check if this condition is met. However, Billy has doubts that this condition is sufficient. That's why he asks you to find out the amount of test examples for the given problem such that the algorithm proposed by Billy makes mistakes.InputThe first line contains the only numberN(1 ≤N≤ 106).OutputOutput one number — the amount of requiredA,BandCfrom the range[1,N].ExamplesInput4Output2Input5Output6NoteFor the first sample the required triples are(3, 4, 3)and(4, 3, 3).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "72538dfa", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a positive integer $N$, find the number of triples $(A, B, C)$ where $1 \\le A, B, C \\le N$ such that:\n\n*  $A \\times B \\neq C$ \n*  $d(A \\times B) = d(d(A) \\times d(B))$ \n\nwhere $d(x)$ is the digital root of $x$.
