Characteristics of Rectanglestime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutGerald found a table consisting ofnrows andmcolumns. As a prominent expert on rectangular tables, he immediately counted the table's properties, that is, the minimum of the numbers in the corners of the table (minimum of four numbers). However, he did not like the final value — it seemed to be too small. And to make this value larger, he decided to crop the table a little: delete some columns on the left and some on the right, as well as some rows from the top and some from the bottom. Find what the maximum property of the table can be after such cropping. Note that the table should have at least two rows and at least two columns left in the end. The number of cropped rows or columns from each of the four sides can be zero.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandm(2 ≤n,m≤ 1000). The followingnlines describe the table.
