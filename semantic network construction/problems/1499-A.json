Domino on Windowsilltime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a board represented as a grid with $$$2 \\\\times n$$$ cells.The first $$$k_1$$$ cells on the first row and first $$$k_2$$$ cells on the second row are colored in white. All other cells are colored in black.You have $$$w$$$ white dominoes ($$$2 \\\\times 1$$$ tiles, both cells are colored in white) and $$$b$$$ black dominoes ($$$2 \\\\times 1$$$ tiles, both cells are colored in black).You can place a white domino on the board if both board's cells are white and not occupied by any other domino. In the same way, you can place a black domino if both cells are black and not occupied by any other domino.Can you place all $$$w + b$$$ dominoes on the board if you can place dominoes both horizontally and vertically?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 3000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k_1$$$ and $$$k_2$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$; $$$0 \\\\le k_1, k_2 \\\\le n$$$).The second line of each test case contains two integers $$$w$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le w, b \\\\le n$$$).OutputFor each test case, printYESif it's possible to place all $$$w + b$$$ dominoes on the board andNO, otherwise.You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the stringsyEs,yes,YesandYESare all recognized as positive answer).ExampleInput5 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 3 0 0 1 3 4 3 1 2 2 5 4 3 3 1OutputNO YES NO YES YESNoteIn the first test case, $$$n = 1$$$, $$$k_1 = 0$$$ and $$$k_2 = 1$$$. It means that $$$2 \\\\times 1$$$ board has black cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ and white cell $$$(2, 1)$$$. So, you can't place any white domino, since there is only one white cell.In the second test case, the board of the same size $$$2 \\\\times 1$$$, but both cell are white. Since $$$w = 0$$$ and $$$b = 0$$$, so you can place $$$0 + 0 = 0$$$ dominoes on the board.In the third test case, board $$$2 \\\\times 3$$$, but fully colored in black (since $$$k_1 = k_2 = 0$$$), so you can't place any white domino.In the fourth test case, cells $$$(1, 1)$$$, $$$(1, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 3)$$$, and $$$(2, 1)$$$ are white and other cells are black. You can place $$$2$$$ white dominoes at positions $$$((1, 1), (2, 1))$$$ and $$$((1, 2), (1, 3))$$$ and $$$2$$$ black dominoes at positions $$$((1, 4), (2, 4))$$$ $$$((2, 2), (2, 3))$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "34442275", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have a rectangular board with $2 \\times n$ cells.
