Ira and Flamencotime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIra loves Spanish flamenco dance very much. She decided to start her own dance studio and found $$$n$$$ students, $$$i$$$th of whom haslevel$$$a_i$$$.Ira can choose several of her students and set a dance with them. So she can set a huge number of dances, but she is only interested inmagnificentdances. The dance is calledmagnificentif the following is true:exactly$$$m$$$ students participate in the dance;levelsof all dancers arepairwise distinct;levelsof every two dancers have an absolute differencestrictly lessthan $$$m$$$.For example, if $$$m = 3$$$ and $$$a = [4, 2, 2, 3, 6]$$$, the following dances aremagnificent(students participating in the dance are highlighted in red): $$$[\\\\color{red}{4}, 2, \\\\color{red}{2}, \\\\color{red}{3}, 6]$$$, $$$[\\\\color{red}{4}, \\\\color{red}{2}, 2, \\\\color{red}{3}, 6]$$$. At the same time dances $$$[\\\\color{red}{4}, 2, 2, \\\\color{red}{3}, 6]$$$, $$$[4, \\\\color{red}{2}, \\\\color{red}{2}, \\\\color{red}{3}, 6]$$$, $$$[\\\\color{red}{4}, 2, 2, \\\\color{red}{3}, \\\\color{red}{6}]$$$ are notmagnificent.In the dance $$$[\\\\color{red}{4}, 2, 2, \\\\color{red}{3}, 6]$$$ only $$$2$$$ students participate, although $$$m = 3$$$.The dance $$$[4, \\\\color{red}{2}, \\\\color{red}{2}, \\\\color{red}{3}, 6]$$$ involves students withlevels$$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$, althoughlevelsof all dancers must be pairwise distinct.In the dance $$$[\\\\color{red}{4}, 2, 2, \\\\color{red}{3}, \\\\color{red}{6}]$$$ students withlevels$$$3$$$ and $$$6$$$ participate, but $$$|3 - 6| = 3$$$, although $$$m = 3$$$.Help Ira count the number ofmagnificentdances that she can set. Since this number can be very large, count itmodulo$$$10^9 + 7$$$. Two dances are considered different if the sets of students participating in them are different.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of Ira students and the number of dancers in themagnificentdance.The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) —levelsof students.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcasesdoes not exceed$$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print a single integer — the number ofmagnificentdances. Since this number can be very large, print itmodulo$$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExampleInput97 48 10 10 9 6 11 75 34 2 2 3 68 21 5 2 2 3 1 3 33 33 3 35 13 4 3 10 712 35 2 1 1 4 3 5 5 5 2 7 51 113 21 2 32 21 2Output5 2 10 0 5 11 1 2 1NoteIn the first testcase, Ira can set suchmagnificentdances: $$$[\\\\color{red}{8}, 10, 10, \\\\color{red}{9}, \\\\color{red}{6}, 11, \\\\color{red}{7}]$$$, $$$[\\\\color{red}{8}, \\\\color{red}{10}, 10, \\\\color{red}{9}, 6, 11, \\\\color{red}{7}]$$$, $$$[\\\\color{red}{8}, 10, \\\\color{red}{10}, \\\\color{red}{9}, 6, 11, \\\\color{red}{7}]$$$, $$$[\\\\color{red}{8}, 10, \\\\color{red}{10}, \\\\color{red}{9}, 6, \\\\color{red}{11}, 7]$$$, $$$[\\\\color{red}{8}, \\\\color{red}{10}, 10, \\\\color{red}{9}, 6, \\\\color{red}{11}, 7]$$$.The second testcase is explained in the statements.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "efa708aa", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, representing the levels of $n$ students.
