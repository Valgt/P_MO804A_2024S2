Foreignertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTraveling around the world you noticed that many shop owners raise prices to inadequate values if the see you are a foreigner.You define inadequate numbers as follows:all integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ are inadequate;for an integer $$$x \\\\ge 10$$$ to be inadequate, it is required that the integer $$$\\\\lfloor x / 10 \\\\rfloor$$$ is inadequate, but that's not the only condition. Let's sort all the inadequate integers. Let $$$\\\\lfloor x / 10 \\\\rfloor$$$ have number $$$k$$$ in this order. Then, the integer $$$x$$$ is inadequate only if the last digit of $$$x$$$ is strictly less than the reminder of division of $$$k$$$ by $$$11$$$.Here $$$\\\\lfloor x / 10 \\\\rfloor$$$ denotes $$$x/10$$$ rounded down.Thus, if $$$x$$$ is the $$$m$$$-th in increasing order inadequate number, and $$$m$$$ gives the remainder $$$c$$$ when divided by $$$11$$$, then integers $$$10 \\\\cdot x + 0, 10 \\\\cdot x + 1 \\\\ldots, 10 \\\\cdot x + (c - 1)$$$ are inadequate, while integers $$$10 \\\\cdot x + c, 10 \\\\cdot x + (c + 1), \\\\ldots, 10 \\\\cdot x + 9$$$ are not inadequate.The first several inadequate integers are $$$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 21, 30, 31, 32 \\\\ldots$$$. After that, since $$$4$$$ is the fourth inadequate integer, $$$40, 41, 42, 43$$$ are inadequate, while $$$44, 45, 46, \\\\ldots, 49$$$ are not inadequate; since $$$10$$$ is the $$$10$$$-th inadequate number, integers $$$100, 101, 102, \\\\ldots, 109$$$ are all inadequate. And since $$$20$$$ is the $$$11$$$-th inadequate number, none of $$$200, 201, 202, \\\\ldots, 209$$$ is inadequate.You wrote down all the prices you have seen in a trip. Unfortunately, all integers got concatenated in one large digit string $$$s$$$ and you lost the bounds between the neighboring integers. You are now interested in the number of substrings of the resulting string that form an inadequate number. If a substring appears more than once at different positions, all its appearances are counted separately.InputThe only line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 10^5$$$), consisting only of digits. It is guaranteed that the first digit of $$$s$$$ is not zero.OutputIn the only line print the number of substrings of $$$s$$$ that form an inadequate number.ExamplesInput4021Output6Input110Output3NoteIn the first example the inadequate numbers in the string are $$$1, 2, 4, 21, 40, 402$$$.In the second example the inadequate numbers in the string are $$$1$$$ and $$$10$$$, and $$$1$$$ appears twice (on the first and on the second positions).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2f8c985f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string $s$ consisting only of digits.  \n\nDetermine the number of substrings of $s$ that form an \"inadequate number\".\n\nAn inadequate number is defined as follows:\n\n* All integers from 1 to 9 are inadequate.\n* For an integer $x \\ge 10$ to be inadequate, the integer $\\lfloor x/10 \\rfloor$ must be inadequate.
