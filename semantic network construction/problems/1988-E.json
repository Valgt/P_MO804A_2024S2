Range Minimum Sumtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor an array $$$[a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n]$$$ of length $$$n$$$, define $$$f(a)$$$ as the sum of the minimum element over all subsegments. That is, $$$$$$f(a)=\\\\sum_{l=1}^n\\\\sum_{r=l}^n \\\\min_{l\\\\le i\\\\le r}a_i.$$$$$$A permutation is a sequence of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ containing each number exactly once. You are given a permutation $$$[a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n]$$$. For each $$$i$$$, solve the following problem independently:Erase $$$a_i$$$ from $$$a$$$, concatenating the remaining parts, resulting in $$$b = [a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_{i-1},\\\\;a_{i+1},\\\\ldots,a_{n}]$$$.Calculate $$$f(b)$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 5\\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le a_i\\\\le n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, print one line containing $$$n$$$ integers.
