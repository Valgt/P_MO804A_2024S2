Collecting Gametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers and a score. If your score is greater than or equal to $$$a_i$$$, then you can increase your score by $$$a_i$$$ and remove $$$a_i$$$ from the array.For each index $$$i$$$, output the maximum number of additional array elements that you can remove if you remove $$$a_i$$$ and then set your score to $$$a_i$$$. Note that the removal of $$$a_i$$$ should not be counted in the answer.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers, the $$$i$$$-th of which denotes the maximum number of additional array elements that you can remove if you remove $$$a_i$$$ from the array and then set your score to $$$a_i$$$.ExampleInput4520 5 1 4 231434 7 1442115999999999 999999999 999999999 1000000000 1000000000Output4 3 0 3 1  1 0 2  0  4 4 4 4 4NoteIn the first test case, the answers are as follows:If we start with $$$i=4$$$, our initial score is $$$a_4=4$$$ and $$$a=[20,5,1,2]$$$. We can remove $$$3$$$ additional elements in the following order:Since $$$4 \\\\ge 1$$$, we can remove $$$1$$$ and our score becomes $$$5$$$. After this, $$$a=[20,5,2]$$$.Since $$$5 \\\\ge 5$$$, we can remove $$$5$$$ and our score becomes $$$10$$$. After this, $$$a=[20,2]$$$.Since $$$10 \\\\ge 2$$$, we can remove $$$2$$$ and our score becomes $$$12$$$. After this, $$$a=[20]$$$.If we start with $$$i=1$$$ we can remove all remaining elements in the array, so the answer is $$$4$$$.If we start with $$$i=2$$$, we can remove $$$3$$$ additional elements in the following order: $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$2$$$.If we start with $$$i=3$$$, we can remove no additional elements.If we start with $$$i=5$$$, we can remove $$$1$$$ additional element: $$$1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "db11c627", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of positive integers.
