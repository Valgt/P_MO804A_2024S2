Gargari and Bishopstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutGargari is jealous that his friend Caisa won the game from the previous problem. He wants to prove that he is a genius.He has an×nchessboard. Each cell of the chessboard has a number written on it. Gargari wants to place two bishops on the chessboard in such a way that there is no cell that is attacked by both of them. Consider a cell with numberxwritten on it, if this cell is attacked by one of the bishops Gargari will getxdollars for it. Tell Gargari, how to place bishops on the chessboard to get maximum amount of money.We assume a cell is attacked by a bishop, if the cell is located on the same diagonal with the bishop (the cell, where the bishop is, also considered attacked by it).InputThe first line contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 2000). Each of the nextnlines containsnintegersaij(0 ≤aij≤ 109)— description of the chessboard.OutputOn the first line print the maximal number of dollars Gargari will get. On the next line print four integers:x1,y1,x2,y2(1 ≤x1,y1,x2,y2≤n), wherexiis the number of the row where thei-th bishop should be placed,yiis the number of the column where thei-th bishop should be placed. Consider rows are numbered from 1 tonfrom top to bottom, and columns are numbered from 1 tonfrom left to right.If there are several optimal solutions, you can print any of them.ExamplesInput41 1 1 12 1 1 01 1 1 01 0 0 1Output122 2 3 2", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2955fc59", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an $n \\times n$ chessboard.
