Arithmetic Progressiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutEverybody knows what an arithmetic progression is. Let us remind you just in case that anarithmetic progressionis such sequence of numbersa1,a2, ...,anof lengthn, that the following condition fulfills:a2-a1=a3-a2=a4-a3= ... =ai+ 1-ai= ... =an-an- 1.For example, sequences [1, 5], [10], [5, 4, 3] are arithmetic progressions and sequences [1, 3, 2], [1, 2, 4] are not.Alexander hasncards containing integers. Arthur wants to give Alexander exactly one more card with a number so that he could use the resultingn+ 1cards to make an arithmetic progression (Alexander has to use all of his cards).Arthur has already bought a card but he hasn't written a number on it. Help him, print all integers that you can write on a card so that the described condition fulfilled.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105)— the number of cards. The next line contains the sequence of integers — the numbers on Alexander's cards. The numbers are positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed108.OutputIf Arthur can write infinitely many distinct integers on the card, print on a single line -1.Otherwise, print on the first line the number of integers that suit you. In the second line, print the numbers in the increasing order. Note that the numbers in the answer can exceed108or even be negative (see test samples).ExamplesInput34 1 7Output2-2 10Input110Output-1Input41 3 5 9Output17Input44 3 4 5Output0Input22 4Output30 3 6", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2979b443", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ integers.
