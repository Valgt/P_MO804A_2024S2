String Modificationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya has a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. He decides to make the following modification to the string:Pick an integer $$$k$$$, ($$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n$$$).For $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-k+1$$$, reverse the substring $$$s[i:i+k-1]$$$ of $$$s$$$. For example, if string $$$s$$$ isqwerand $$$k = 2$$$, below is the series of transformations the string goes through:qwer(original string)wqer(after reversing the first substring of length $$$2$$$)weqr(after reversing the second substring of length $$$2$$$)werq(after reversing the last substring of length $$$2$$$)Hence, the resulting string after modifying $$$s$$$ with $$$k = 2$$$ iswerq.Vasya wants to choose a $$$k$$$ such that the string obtained after the above-mentioned modification is lexicographically smallest possible among all choices of $$$k$$$. Among all such $$$k$$$, he wants to choose the smallest one. Since he is busy attending Felicity 2020, he asks for your help.A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:$$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \\\\ne b$$$;in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases.The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5000$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ lowercase latin letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.OutputFor each testcase output two lines:In the first line output the lexicographically smallest string $$$s'$$$ achievable after the above-mentioned modification.In the second line output the appropriate value of $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n$$$) that you chose for performing the modification. If there are multiple values of $$$k$$$ that give the lexicographically smallest string, output the smallest value of $$$k$$$ among them.ExampleInput6 4 abab 6 qwerty 5 aaaaa 6 alaska 9 lfpbavjsm 1 pOutputabab 1 ertyqw 3 aaaaa 1 aksala 6 avjsmbpfl 5 p 1NoteIn the first testcase of the first sample, the string modification results for the sampleababare as follows :for $$$k = 1$$$ :ababfor $$$k = 2$$$ :babafor $$$k = 3$$$ :ababfor $$$k = 4$$$ :babaThe lexicographically smallest string achievable through modification isababfor $$$k = 1$$$ and $$$3$$$. Smallest value of $$$k$$$ needed to achieve is hence $$$1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "dd4609fb", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string of lowercase letters.
