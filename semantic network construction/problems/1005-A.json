Tanya and Stairwaystime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLittle girl Tanya climbs the stairs inside a multi-storey building. Every time Tanya climbs a stairway, she starts counting steps from $$$1$$$ to the number of steps in this stairway. She speaks every number aloud. For example, if she climbs two stairways, the first of which contains $$$3$$$ steps, and the second contains $$$4$$$ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $$$1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4$$$.You are given all the numbers pronounced by Tanya. How many stairways did she climb? Also, output the number of steps in each stairway.The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.InputThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$) — the total number of numbers pronounced by Tanya.The second line contains integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 1000$$$) — all the numbers Tanya pronounced while climbing the stairs, in order from the first to the last pronounced number. Passing a stairway with $$$x$$$ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $$$1, 2, \\\\dots, x$$$ in that order.The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.OutputIn the first line, output $$$t$$$ — the number of stairways that Tanya climbed. In the second line, output $$$t$$$ numbers — the number of steps in each stairway she climbed. Write the numbers in the correct order of passage of the stairways.ExamplesInput71 2 3 1 2 3 4Output23 4Input41 1 1 1Output41 1 1 1Input51 2 3 4 5Output15Input51 2 1 2 1Output32 2 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "875f3c2e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of numbers.
