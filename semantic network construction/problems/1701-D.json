Permutation Restorationtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp had a permutation $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once).Then Monocarp calculated an array of integers $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$, where $$$b_i = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{i}{a_i} \\\\right\\\\rfloor$$$. For example, if the permutation $$$a$$$ is $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$, then the array $$$b$$$ is equal to $$$\\\\left[ \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right\\\\rfloor, \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2}{1} \\\\right\\\\rfloor, \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\right\\\\rfloor, \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\right] = [0, 2, 0, 1]$$$.Unfortunately, the Monocarp has lost his permutation, so he wants to restore it. Your task is to find a permutation $$$a$$$ that corresponds to the given array $$$b$$$. If there are multiple possible permutations, then print any of them. The tests are constructed in such a way that least one suitable permutation exists.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le b_i \\\\le n$$$).Additional constrains on the input:the sum of $$$n$$$ over test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$;there exists at least one permutation $$$a$$$ that would yield this array $$$b$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers — a permutation $$$a$$$ that corresponds to the given array $$$b$$$. If there are multiple possible permutations, then print any of them.ExampleInput440 2 0 121 150 0 1 4 130 1 3Output2 1 4 3  1 2  3 4 2 1 5  3 2 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "234e3255", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array $b$ of size $n$.
