Kalindrome Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAn array $$$[b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_m]$$$ is a palindrome, if $$$b_i = b_{m+1-i}$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. Empty array is also a palindrome.An array is calledkalindrome, if the following condition holds:It's possible to select some integer $$$x$$$ and delete some of the elements of the array equal to $$$x$$$, so that the remaining array (after gluing together the remaining parts) is a palindrome.Note that you don't have to delete all elements equal to $$$x$$$, and you don't have to delete at least one element equal to $$$x$$$.For example :$$$[1, 2, 1]$$$ is kalindrome because you can simply not delete a single element.$$$[3, 1, 2, 3, 1]$$$ is kalindrome because you can choose $$$x = 3$$$ and delete both elements equal to $$$3$$$, obtaining array $$$[1, 2, 1]$$$, which is a palindrome.$$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ is not kalindrome.You are given an array $$$[a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n]$$$. Determine if $$$a$$$ is kalindrome or not.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$) — elements of the array.It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases won't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, printYESif $$$a$$$ is kalindrome andNOotherwise. You can print each letter in any case.ExampleInput4 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 5 1 4 4 1 4OutputYES YES NO YESNoteIn the first test case, array $$$[1]$$$ is already a palindrome, so it's a kalindrome as well.In the second test case, we can choose $$$x = 2$$$, delete the second element, and obtain array $$$[1]$$$, which is a palindrome.In the third test case, it's impossible to obtain a palindrome.In the fourth test case, you can choose $$$x = 4$$$ and delete the fifth element, obtaining $$$[1, 4, 4, 1]$$$. You also can choose $$$x = 1$$$, delete the first and the fourth elements, and obtain $$$[4, 4, 4]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "cd24912a", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a list of numbers, determine if you can remove some occurrences of a single number from the list to make the remaining list symmetrical (reads the same forwards and backwards)."}, {"prompt_md5": "86c5a6ad", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
