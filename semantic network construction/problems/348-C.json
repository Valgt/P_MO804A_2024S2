Let's denoteSk= {Sk,i} (1 ≤i≤ |Sk|). In other words,Sk,iis some element from setSk.In this problem you have to answerqqueries of the two types:Find the sum of elements with indices from setSk:. The query format is \"? k\".Add numberxto all elements at indices from setSk:aSk,iis replaced byaSk,i+xfor alli(1 ≤i≤ |Sk|).

Each query looks like either \"? k\" or \"+ k x\" and sits on a single line. For all queries the following limits are held:1 ≤k≤m,|x| ≤ 108. The queries are given in order they need to be answered.It is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all setsSkdoesn't exceed105.OutputAfter each first type query print the required sum on a single line.Please, do not write the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++.
