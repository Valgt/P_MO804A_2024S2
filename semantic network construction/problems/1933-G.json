Turtle Magic: Royal Turtle Shell Patterntime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTurtle Alice is currently designing a fortune cookie box, and she would like to incorporate the theory of LuoShu into it.The box can be seen as an $$$n \\\\times m$$$ grid ($$$n, m \\\\ge 5$$$), where the rows are numbered $$$1, 2, \\\\dots, n$$$ and columns are numbered $$$1, 2, \\\\dots, m$$$. Each cell can either beemptyor have a single fortune cookie of one of the following shapes:circleorsquare. The cell at the intersection of the $$$a$$$-th row and the $$$b$$$-th column is denoted as $$$(a, b)$$$.Initially, the entire grid is empty. Then, Alice performs $$$q$$$ operations on the fortune cookie box. The $$$i$$$-th operation ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le q$$$) is as follows: specify a currently empty cell $$$(r_i,c_i)$$$ and a shape (circle or square), then put a fortune cookie of the specified shape on cell $$$(r_i,c_i)$$$. Note that after the $$$i$$$-th operation, the cell $$$(r_i,c_i)$$$ is no longer empty.Before all operationsandafter each of the $$$q$$$ operations, Alice wonders what the number of ways to place fortune cookies inall remaining empty cellsis, such that the following condition is satisfied:No three consecutive cells (in horizontal, vertical, and both diagonal directions) contain cookies of the same shape. Formally:There does not exist any $$$(i,j)$$$ satisfying $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n, 1 \\\\le j \\\\le m-2$$$, such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells $$$(i,j), (i,j+1), (i,j+2)$$$.There does not exist any $$$(i,j)$$$ satisfying $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n-2, 1 \\\\le j \\\\le m$$$, such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells $$$(i,j), (i+1,j), (i+2,j)$$$.There does not exist any $$$(i,j)$$$ satisfying $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n-2, 1 \\\\le j \\\\le m-2$$$, such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells $$$(i,j), (i+1,j+1), (i+2,j+2)$$$.There does not exist any $$$(i,j)$$$ satisfying $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n-2, 1 \\\\le j \\\\le m-2$$$, such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells $$$(i,j+2), (i+1,j+1), (i+2,j)$$$.You should output all answers modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$. Also note that it is possible that after some operations, the condition is already not satisfied with the already placed candies, in this case you should output $$$0$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$5 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 10^9, 0 \\\\le q \\\\le \\\\min(n \\\\times m, 10^5)$$$).The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$r_i$$$, $$$c_i$$$ and a single string $$$\\\\text{shape}_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le r_i \\\\le n, 1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le m$$$, $$$\\\\text{shape}_i=$$$\"circle\"or\"square\"), representing the operations. It is guaranteed that the cell on the $$$r_i$$$-th row and the $$$c_i$$$-th column is initially empty. That means, each $$$(r_i,c_i)$$$ will appear at most once in the updates.The sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$q+1$$$ lines. The first line of each test case should contain the answer before any operations. The $$$i$$$-th line ($$$2 \\\\le i \\\\le q+1$$$) should contain the answer after the first $$$i-1$$$ operations. All answers should be taken modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.ExampleInput26 7 43 3 circle3 6 square5 3 circle5 4 square5 5 31 1 circle1 2 circle1 3 circleOutput8 4 3 1 0 8 4 1 0NoteIn the second sample, after placing a circle-shaped fortune cookie to cells $$$(1,1)$$$, $$$(1,2)$$$ and $$$(1,3)$$$, the condition is already not satisfied.
