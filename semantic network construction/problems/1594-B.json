Special Numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTheofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.Let's call a positive numberspecialif it can be written as a sum ofdifferentnon-negative powers of $$$n$$$. For example, for $$$n = 4$$$ number $$$17$$$ is special, because it can be written as $$$4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17$$$, but $$$9$$$ is not.Theofanis asks you to help him find the $$$k$$$-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the $$$k$$$-th special number in increasing order modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.ExampleInput3 3 4 2 12 105 564Output9 12 3595374NoteFor $$$n = 3$$$ the sequence is $$$[1,3,4,9...]$$$", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7502974d", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number *n*, find the *k*th smallest number that can be made by adding together different powers of *n* (e.g., 1, *n*, *n*², *n*³, etc.).
