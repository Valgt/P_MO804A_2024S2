Incineratetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTo destroy humanity, The Monster Association sent $$$n$$$ monsters to Earth's surface. The $$$i$$$-th monster has health $$$h_i$$$ and power $$$p_i$$$.With his last resort attack, True Spiral Incineration Cannon, Genos can deal $$$k$$$ damage to all monsters alive. In other words, Genos can reduce the health of all monsters by $$$k$$$ (if $$$k > 0$$$) with a single attack.However, after every attack Genos makes, the monsters advance. With their combined efforts, they reduce Genos' attack damage by the power of the $$$^\\\\dagger$$$weakest monster $$$^\\\\ddagger$$$alive. In other words, the minimum $$$p_i$$$ among all currently living monsters is subtracted from the value of $$$k$$$ after each attack.$$$^\\\\dagger$$$The Weakest monster is the one with the least power.$$$^\\\\ddagger$$$A monster is alive if its health is strictly greater than $$$0$$$.Will Genos be successful in killing all the monsters?InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, k \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of monsters and Genos' initial attack damage. Then two lines follow, each containing $$$n$$$ integers describing the arrays $$$h$$$ and $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le h_i, p_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the answer — \"YES\" (without quotes) if Genos could kill all monsters and \"NO\" otherwise.ExampleInput36 718 5 13 9 10 12 7 2 1 2 63 45 5 54 4 43 22 1 31 1 1OutputYES NO YESNoteIn the first example, after Genos' first attack, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ will update to:$$$h: [11,0,6,2,3,0]$$$$$$k: 7-1 = 6$$$After second attack:$$$h: [5,0,0,0,0,0]$$$$$$k: 6-2 = 4$$$After third attack:$$$h: [1,0,0,0,0,0]$$$$$$k: 4-2 = 2$$$After fourth attack:$$$h: [0,0,0,0,0,0]$$$As Genos could kill all monsters, the answer isYES.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1ce880ed", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $t$ test cases.
