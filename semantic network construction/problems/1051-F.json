This triple means that there is an edge between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ of weight $$$d_i$$$. It is guaranteed that graph contains no self-loops and multiple edges.The next line contains a single integer $$$q~(1 \\\\le q \\\\le 10^5)$$$ — the number of queries.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i~(1 \\\\le u_i, v_i \\\\le n)$$$ — descriptions of the queries.Pay attention to the restriction $$$m - n ~ \\\\le ~ 20$$$.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines.The $$$i$$$-th line should contain the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query — the shortest distance between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.ExamplesInput3 31 2 32 3 13 1 531 21 32 3Output341Input8 131 2 42 3 63 4 14 5 125 6 36 7 87 8 71 4 11 8 32 6 92 7 14 6 36 8 281 51 72 32 83 73 46 87 8Output75677127", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "453c199c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.
