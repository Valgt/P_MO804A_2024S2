Let's define the operation ofreplacementas the following sequence of steps: find a substring \"..\" (two consecutive periods) in strings, of all occurrences of the substring let's choose the first one, and replace this substring with string \".\". In other words, during the replacement operation, the first two consecutive periods are replaced by one. If stringscontains no two consecutive periods, then nothing happens.Let's definef(s)as the minimum number of operations ofreplacementto perform, so that the string does not have any two consecutive periods left.You need to processmqueries, thei-th results in that the character at positionxi(1 ≤xi≤n) of stringsis assigned valueci.
