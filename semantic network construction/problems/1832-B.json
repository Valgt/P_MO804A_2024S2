During each operation, you doexactly oneof the following two actions (you choose which to do yourself):findtwo minimum elementsin the array, and delete them;findthe maximum elementin the array, and delete it.You have to calculate the maximum possible sum of elements in the resulting array.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines:the first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 99999$$$; $$$2k < n$$$) — the number of elements and operations, respectively.the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$; all $$$a_i$$$ are different) — the elements of the array.Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible sum of elements in the resulting array.ExampleInput65 12 5 1 10 65 22 5 1 10 63 11 2 36 115 22 12 10 13 116 215 22 12 10 13 115 1999999996 999999999 999999997 999999998 999999995Output21 11 3 62 46 3999999986NoteIn the first testcase, applying the first operation produces the following outcome:two minimums are $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$; removing them leaves the array as $$$[5, 10, 6]$$$, with sum $$$21$$$;a maximum is $$$10$$$; removing it leaves the array as $$$[2, 5, 1, 6]$$$, with sum $$$14$$$.$$$21$$$ is the best answer.In the second testcase, it's optimal to first erase two minimums, then a maximum.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c7ff70b6", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
