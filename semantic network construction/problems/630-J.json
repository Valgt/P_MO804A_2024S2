On the basis of his experience he predicts thatnpeople will buy the game during the first month. Now Petya wants to determine how many times he will get the bonus. Help him to know it.InputThe only line of the input contains one integern(1 ≤n≤ 1018) — the prediction on the number of people who will buy the game.OutputOutput one integer showing how many numbers from1tonare divisible by all numbers from2to10.ExamplesInput3000Output1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0bda24e5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a positive integer $n$, count how many numbers from 1 to $n$ are divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10."}, {"prompt_md5": "8220de07", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number, count how many numbers from 1 to that number are divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10."}]}
