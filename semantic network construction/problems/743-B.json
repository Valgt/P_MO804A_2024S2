Chloe and the sequencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputChloe, the same as Vladik, is a competitive programmer. She didn't have any problems to get to the olympiad like Vladik, but she was confused by the task proposed on the olympiad.Let's consider the following algorithm of generating a sequence of integers. Initially we have a sequence consisting of a single element equal to1. Then we perform(n- 1)steps. On each step we take the sequence we've got on the previous step, append it to the end of itself and insert in the middle the minimum positive integer we haven't used before. For example, we get the sequence[1, 2, 1]after the first step, the sequence[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]after the second step.The task is to find the value of the element with indexk(the elements are numbered from1) in the obtained sequence, i. e. after(n- 1)steps.Please help Chloe to solve the problem!InputThe only line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 50,1 ≤k≤ 2n- 1).OutputPrint single integer — the integer at thek-th position in the obtained sequence.ExamplesInput3 2Output2Input4 8Output4NoteIn the first sample the obtained sequence is[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1].
