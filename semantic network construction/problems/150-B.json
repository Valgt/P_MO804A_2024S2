It is so cold that one gets funny thoughts. For example, let's say there are strings with the length exactlyn, based on the alphabet of sizem. Any its substring with length equal tokis a palindrome. How many such strings exist? Your task is to find their quantity modulo1000000007(109+ 7). Be careful and don't miss a string or two!Let us remind you that a string is a palindrome if it can be read the same way in either direction, from the left to the right and from the right to the left.InputThe first and only line contains three integers:n,mandk(1 ≤n,m,k≤ 2000).OutputPrint a single integer — the number of strings of the described type modulo1000000007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput1 1 1Output1Input5 2 4Output2NoteIn the first sample only one string is valid: \"a\" (let's denote the only letter of our alphabet as \"a\").In the second sample (if we denote the alphabet letters as \"a\" and \"b\") the following strings are valid: \"aaaaa\" and \"bbbbb\".", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "17b2ae27", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an integer $n$, an integer $m$, and an integer $k$, find the number of strings of length $n$ that use an alphabet of size $m$ such that every substring of length $k$ is a palindrome.
