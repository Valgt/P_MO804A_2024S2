Vasya and a Treetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya has a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices with root in vertex $$$1$$$. At first all vertices has $$$0$$$ written on it.Let $$$d(i, j)$$$ be the distance between vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, i.e. number of edges in the shortest path from $$$i$$$ to $$$j$$$. Also, let's denote $$$k$$$-subtree of vertex $$$x$$$ — set of vertices $$$y$$$ such that next two conditions are met:$$$x$$$ is the ancestor of $$$y$$$ (each vertex is the ancestor of itself);$$$d(x, y) \\\\le k$$$.Vasya needs you to process $$$m$$$ queries. The $$$i$$$-th query is a triple $$$v_i$$$, $$$d_i$$$ and $$$x_i$$$. For each query Vasya adds value $$$x_i$$$ to each vertex from $$$d_i$$$-subtree of $$$v_i$$$.Report to Vasya all values, written on vertices of the tree after processing all queries.InputThe first line contains single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — number of vertices in the tree.Each of next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x, y \\\\le n$$$) — edge between vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. It is guarantied that given graph is a tree.Next line contains single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — number of queries.Each of next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$v_i$$$, $$$d_i$$$, $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$0 \\\\le d_i \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\le x_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — description of the $$$i$$$-th query.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integers is the value, written in the $$$i$$$-th vertex after processing all queries.ExamplesInput5 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 3 1 1 1 2 0 10 4 10 100Output1 11 1 100 0Input5 2 3 2 1 5 4 3 4 5 2 0 4 3 10 1 1 2 3 2 3 10 1 1 7Output10 24 14 11 11NoteIn the first exapmle initial values in vertices are $$$0, 0, 0, 0, 0$$$.
