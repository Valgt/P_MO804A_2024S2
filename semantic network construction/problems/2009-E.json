Klee's SUPER DUPER LARGE Array!!!time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKlee has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ containing integers $$$[k, k+1, ..., k+n-1]$$$ in that order. Klee wants to choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$) such that $$$x = |a_1 + a_2 + \\\\dots + a_i - a_{i+1} - \\\\dots - a_n|$$$ is minimized. Note that for an arbitrary integer $$$z$$$, $$$|z|$$$ represents the absolute value of $$$z$$$.Output the minimum possible value of $$$x$$$.InputThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n, k \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the array and the starting element of the array.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum value of $$$x$$$ on a new line.ExampleInput42 27 25 31000000000 1000000000Output1 5 1 347369930NoteIn the first sample, $$$a = [2, 3]$$$.
