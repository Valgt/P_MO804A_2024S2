Every morning all students wake up at the same time and go to wash. There aremrooms with wash basins. Thei-th of these rooms containsaiwash basins. Every student independently select one the rooms with equal probability and goes to it. After all students selected their rooms, students in each room divide into queues by the number of wash basins so that the size of the largest queue is the least possible. Calculate the expected value of the size of the largest queue among all rooms.InputThe first line contains two positive integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 50) — the amount of students and the amount of rooms. The second line containsmintegersa1,a2, ... ,am(1 ≤ai≤ 50).aimeans the amount of wash basins in thei-th room.OutputOutput single number: the expected value of the size of the largest queue.
