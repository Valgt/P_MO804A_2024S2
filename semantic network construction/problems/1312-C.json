Adding Powerstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSuppose you are performing the following algorithm. There is an array $$$v_1, v_2, \\\\dots, v_n$$$ filled with zeroes at start. The following operation is applied to the array several times — at $$$i$$$-th step ($$$0$$$-indexed) you can:either choose position $$$pos$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le pos \\\\le n$$$) and increase $$$v_{pos}$$$ by $$$k^i$$$;or not choose any position and skip this step.You can choose how the algorithm would behave on each step and when to stop it. The question is: can you make array $$$v$$$ equal to the given array $$$a$$$ ($$$v_j = a_j$$$ for each $$$j$$$) after some step?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Next $$$2T$$$ lines contain test cases — two lines per test case.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 30$$$, $$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le 100$$$) — the size of arrays $$$v$$$ and $$$a$$$ and value $$$k$$$ used in the algorithm.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^{16}$$$) — the array you'd like to achieve.OutputFor each test case printYES(case insensitive) if you can achieve the array $$$a$$$ after some step orNO(case insensitive) otherwise.ExampleInput5 4 100 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 3 4 1 4 1 3 2 0 1 3 3 9 0 59049 810OutputYES YES NO NO YESNoteIn the first test case, you can stop the algorithm before the $$$0$$$-th step, or don't choose any position several times and stop the algorithm.In the second test case, you can add $$$k^0$$$ to $$$v_1$$$ and stop the algorithm.In the third test case, you can't make two $$$1$$$ in the array $$$v$$$.In the fifth test case, you can skip $$$9^0$$$ and $$$9^1$$$, then add $$$9^2$$$ and $$$9^3$$$ to $$$v_3$$$, skip $$$9^4$$$ and finally, add $$$9^5$$$ to $$$v_2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b08a7f3b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array $v$ of size $n$ filled with zeros.
