Perfect Groupstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSaMer has written the greatest test case of all time for one of his problems. For a given array of integers, the problem asks to find the minimum number of groups the array can be divided into, such that the product of any pair of integers in the same group is a perfect square.Each integer must be in exactly one group. However, integers in a group do not necessarily have to be contiguous in the array.SaMer wishes to create more cases from the test case he already has. His test case has an array $$$A$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, and he needs to find the number of contiguous subarrays of $$$A$$$ that have an answer to the problem equal to $$$k$$$ for each integer $$$k$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ (inclusive).InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 5000$$$), the size of the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$,$$$a_2$$$,$$$\\\\dots$$$,$$$a_n$$$ ($$$-10^8 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^8$$$), the values of the array.OutputOutput $$$n$$$ space-separated integers, the $$$k$$$-th integer should be the number of contiguous subarrays of $$$A$$$ that have an answer to the problem equal to $$$k$$$.ExamplesInput25 5Output3 0Input55 -4 2 1 8Output5 5 3 2 0Input10Output1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a5d3d26d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an array of integers, find the number of contiguous subarrays that can be divided into groups such that the product of any two integers in the same group is a perfect square.  \n\nThe output should be a list of integers, where the $k$-th integer represents the number of subarrays with a group count of $k$.\n\n**Input:**\n\n* The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 5000$), the size of the array.\n* The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($-10^8 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^8$), the values of the array.\n\n**Output:**\n\n* Output $n$ space-separated integers, the $k$-th integer should be the number of contiguous subarrays of $A$ that have an answer to the problem equal to $k$."}, {"prompt_md5": "8c3cf42a", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a list of numbers, count how many sublists within the list can be divided into groups where the product of any two numbers in the same group is a perfect square.
