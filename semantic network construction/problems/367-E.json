Sereja and Intervalstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutSereja is interested in intervals of numbers, so he has prepared a problem about intervals for you. An interval of numbers is a pair of integers[l,r](1 ≤l≤r≤m). Interval[l1,r1]belongs to interval[l2,r2]if the following condition is met:l2≤l1≤r1≤r2.Sereja wants to write out a sequence ofnintervals[l1,r1],[l2,r2],...,[ln,rn]on a piece of paper. At that, no interval in the sequence can belong to some other interval of the sequence. Also, Sereja loves numberxvery much and he wants some (at least one) interval in the sequence to haveli=x. Sereja wonders, how many distinct ways to write such intervals are there?Help Sereja and find the required number of ways modulo1000000007(109+ 7).Two ways are considered distinct if there is suchj(1 ≤j≤n), that thej-th intervals in two corresponding sequences are not equal.InputThe first line contains integersn,m,x(1 ≤n·m≤ 100000, 1 ≤x≤m)— the number of segments in the sequence, the constraints on the numbers in segments and Sereja's favourite number.OutputIn a single line print the answer modulo1000000007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput1 1 1Output1Input3 5 1Output240Input2 3 3Output6NoteIn third example next sequences will be correct:{[1, 1], [3, 3]},{[1, 2], [3, 3]},{[2, 2], [3, 3]},{[3, 3], [1, 1]},{[3, 3], [2, 2]},{[3, 3], [1, 2]}.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "fd1802aa", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given three integers $n$, $m$, and $x$ (where $1 \\le n \\cdot m \\le 100000$ and $1 \\le x \\le m$). \n\nYou need to find the number of ways to arrange $n$ intervals, each represented as $[l, r]$ where $1 \\le l \\le r \\le m$, such that:\n\n* No interval is contained within another interval.\n* At least one interval contains the number $x$.\n\nTwo arrangements are considered different if there is at least one interval that is different between them.\n\nOutput the answer modulo $1000000007$."}, {"prompt_md5": "8de1d074", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a number of intervals to create, and a target number.
