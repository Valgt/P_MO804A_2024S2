Reversetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two positive integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. You can perform the following operation with $$$x$$$: write it in its binary form without leading zeros, add $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ to the right of it, reverse the binary form and turn it into a decimal number which is assigned as the new value of $$$x$$$.For example:$$$34$$$ can be turned into $$$81$$$ via one operation: the binary form of $$$34$$$ is $$$100010$$$, if you add $$$1$$$, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get $$$1010001$$$, which is the binary form of $$$81$$$.$$$34$$$ can be turned into $$$17$$$ via one operation: the binary form of $$$34$$$ is $$$100010$$$, if you add $$$0$$$, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get $$$10001$$$, which is the binary form of $$$17$$$.$$$81$$$ can be turned into $$$69$$$ via one operation: the binary form of $$$81$$$ is $$$1010001$$$, if you add $$$0$$$, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get $$$1000101$$$, which is the binary form of $$$69$$$.$$$34$$$ can be turned into $$$69$$$ via two operations: first you turn $$$34$$$ into $$$81$$$ and then $$$81$$$ into $$$69$$$.Your task is to find out whether $$$x$$$ can be turned into $$$y$$$ after a certain number of operations (possibly zero).InputThe only line of the input contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x, y \\\\le 10^{18}$$$).OutputPrintYESif you can make $$$x$$$ equal to $$$y$$$ andNOif you can't.ExamplesInput3 3OutputYESInput7 4OutputNOInput2 8OutputNOInput34 69OutputYESInput8935891487501725 71487131900013807OutputYESNoteIn the first example, you don't even need to do anything.The fourth example is described in the statement.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d0318d58", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two positive integers $x$ and $y$.
