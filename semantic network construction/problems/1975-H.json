Find the lexicographically minimum possible core over all rearrangements of $$$s$$$.$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ A substring of string $$$s$$$ is a continuous segment of letters from $$$s$$$. For example, \"$$$\\\\mathtt{defor}$$$\", \"$$$\\\\mathtt{code}$$$\" and \"$$$\\\\mathtt{o}$$$\" are all substrings of \"$$$\\\\mathtt{codeforces}$$$\" while \"$$$\\\\mathtt{codes}$$$\" and \"$$$\\\\mathtt{aaa}$$$\" are not.$$$^\\\\ddagger$$$ A string $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$q$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:$$$p$$$ is a prefix of $$$q$$$, but $$$p \\\\ne q$$$; orin the first position where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ differ, the string $$$p$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$q$$$ (when compared by their ASCII code).For example, \"$$$\\\\mathtt{code}$$$\" and \"$$$\\\\mathtt{coda}$$$\" are both lexicographically smaller than \"$$$\\\\mathtt{codeforces}$$$\" while \"$$$\\\\mathtt{codeforceston}$$$\" and \"$$$\\\\mathtt{z}$$$\" are not.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t\\\\leq 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq 10^6$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$.The next line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The string $$$s$$$ consists of lowercase English letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the lexicographically minimum possible core over all rearrangements of $$$s$$$.ExampleInput63qaq4cccc6bazoka6zazzzz7ababbbb7ccbabccOutputqaq cccc z zzz bbababb cbcacbcNoteIn the first test case, all possible rearrangements and their corresponding cores are as follows:\"$$$\\\\mathtt{qaq}$$$\", its core is \"$$$\\\\mathtt{qaq}$$$\".\"$$$\\\\mathtt{aqq}$$$\", its core is \"$$$\\\\mathtt{qq}$$$\".\"$$$\\\\mathtt{qqa}$$$\", its core is \"$$$\\\\mathtt{qqa}$$$\".So the core with the minimum lexicographic order in all rearrangement plans is \"$$$\\\\mathtt{qaq}$$$\".", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "dcd1d461", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string of lowercase English letters.
