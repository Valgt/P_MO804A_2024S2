String LCMtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's define a multiplication operation between a string $$$a$$$ and a positive integer $$$x$$$: $$$a \\\\cdot x$$$ is the string that is a result of writing $$$x$$$ copies of $$$a$$$ one after another. For example, \"abc\" $$$\\\\cdot~2~=$$$ \"abcabc\", \"a\" $$$\\\\cdot~5~=$$$ \"aaaaa\".A string $$$a$$$ is divisible by another string $$$b$$$ if there exists an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$b \\\\cdot x = a$$$. For example, \"abababab\" is divisible by \"ab\", but is not divisible by \"ababab\" or \"aa\".LCM of two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ (defined as $$$LCM(s, t)$$$) is the shortest non-empty string that is divisible by both $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$.You are given two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$. Find $$$LCM(s, t)$$$ or report that it does not exist. It can be shown that if $$$LCM(s, t)$$$ exists, it is unique.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2000$$$) â€” the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines, containing strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s|, |t| \\\\le 20$$$). Each character in each of these strings is either 'a' or 'b'.OutputFor each test case, print $$$LCM(s, t)$$$ if it exists; otherwise, print-1. It can be shown that if $$$LCM(s, t)$$$ exists, it is unique.ExampleInput3 baba ba aa aaa aba abOutputbaba aaaaaa -1NoteIn the first test case, \"baba\" = \"baba\" $$$\\\\cdot~1~=$$$ \"ba\" $$$\\\\cdot~2$$$.In the second test case, \"aaaaaa\" = \"aa\" $$$\\\\cdot~3~=$$$ \"aaa\" $$$\\\\cdot~2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f620e26d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two strings,  *s* and *t*, each consisting only of the characters 'a' and 'b'.\n\nDefine a multiplication operation between a string *a* and a positive integer *x* as writing *x* copies of *a* one after another.
