Array Divisibilitytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAn array of integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\cdots,a_n$$$ is beautiful subject to an integer $$$k$$$ if it satisfies the following:The sum of $$$a_{j}$$$ over all $$$j$$$ such that $$$j$$$ is a multiple of $$$k$$$ and $$$1 \\\\le j \\\\le n $$$, itself, is a multiple of $$$k$$$.More formally, if $$$\\\\sum_{k | j} a_{j}$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\le j \\\\le n$$$ then the array $$$a$$$ is beautiful subject to $$$k$$$. Here, the notation $$${k|j}$$$ means $$$k$$$ divides $$$j$$$, that is, $$$j$$$ is a multiple of $$$k$$$.Given $$$n$$$, find an array of positive nonzero integers, with each element less than or equal to $$$10^5$$$ that is beautiful subject to all $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$.It can be shown that an answer always exists.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the size of the array.OutputFor each test case, print the required array as described in the problem statement.ExampleInput3 3 6 7Output4 22 18 10 6 15 32 125 54 23 18 27 36 5 66 7NoteIn the second test case, when $$$n = 6$$$, for all integers $$$k$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 6$$$, let $$$S$$$ be the set of all indices of the array that are divisible by $$$k$$$.When $$$k = 1$$$, $$$S = \\\\{1, 2, 3,4,5,6\\\\}$$$ meaning $$$a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5+a_6=242$$$ must be divisible by $$$1$$$.When $$$k = 2$$$, $$$S = \\\\{2,4,6\\\\}$$$ meaning $$$a_2+a_4+a_6=92$$$ must be divisible by $$$2$$$.When $$$k = 3$$$, $$$S = \\\\{3,6\\\\}$$$ meaning $$$a_3+a_6=69$$$ must divisible by $$$3$$$.When $$$k = 4$$$, $$$S = \\\\{4\\\\}$$$ meaning $$$a_4=32$$$ must divisible by $$$4$$$.When $$$k = 5$$$, $$$S = \\\\{5\\\\}$$$ meaning $$$a_5=125$$$ must divisible by $$$5$$$.When $$$k = 6$$$, $$$S = \\\\{6\\\\}$$$ meaning $$$a_6=54$$$ must divisible by $$$6$$$.The array $$$a = [10, 6, 15, 32, 125, 54]$$$ satisfies all of the above conditions.
