However, as such progressions occur very rarely, he also loves the sequences of numbers where it is enough to delete a single element to get a geometric progression.In this task we shall define geometric progressions as finite sequences of numbersa1,a2, ...,ak, whereai=c·bi- 1for some real numberscandb. For example, the sequences [2, -4, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0], [199] are geometric progressions and [0, 1, 2, 3] is not.Recently Polycarp has found a sequence and he can't classify it. Help him to do it. Determine whether it is a geometric progression. If it is not, check if it can become a geometric progression if an element is deleted from it.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 105) — the number of elements in the given sequence. The second line contains the given sequence. The numbers are space-separated. All the elements of the given sequence are integers and their absolute value does not exceed104.OutputPrint0, if the given sequence is a geometric progression. Otherwise, check if it is possible to make the sequence a geometric progression by deleting a single element. If it is possible, print1. If it is impossible, print2.ExamplesInput43 6 12 24Output0Input4-8 -16 24 -32Output1Input40 1 2 3Output2", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ecab3a2e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of integers.
