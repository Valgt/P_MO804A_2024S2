Ehab and a component choosing problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou're given a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ nodes. Every node $$$u$$$ has a weight $$$a_u$$$. You want to choose an integer $$$k$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le k \\\\le n)$$$ and then choose $$$k$$$ connected components of nodes that don't overlap (i.e every node is in at most 1 component). Let the set of nodes you chose be $$$s$$$. You want to maximize:$$$$$$\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\limits_{u \\\\in s} a_u}{k}$$$$$$In other words, you want to maximize the sum of weights of nodes in $$$s$$$ divided by the number of connected components you chose. Also, if there are several solutions, you want tomaximize $$$k$$$.Note that adjacent nodescanbelong to different components. Refer to the third sample.InputThe first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5)$$$, the number of nodes in the tree.The second line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\\\\dots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ $$$(|a_i| \\\\le 10^9)$$$, the weights of the nodes.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines, each contains 2 space-separated integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le u,v \\\\le n)$$$ which means there's an edge between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.OutputPrint the answer as anon-reducedfraction represented by 2 space-separated integers. The fraction itself should be maximized and if there are several possible ways, you should maximize the denominator.
