We define $$$a_{i, j}$$$ as the element in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column of the matrix.Two cells of the matrix areconnectedif they share a side, and the elements in these cells are equal. Two cells of the matrix belong to the sameconnected componentif there exists a sequence $$$s_1$$$, $$$s_2$$$, ..., $$$s_k$$$ such that $$$s_1$$$ is the first cell, $$$s_k$$$ is the second cell, and for every $$$i \\\\in [1, k - 1]$$$, $$$s_i$$$ and $$$s_{i + 1}$$$ are connected.You are given $$$q$$$ queries of the form $$$x_i$$$ $$$y_i$$$ $$$c_i$$$ ($$$i \\\\in [1, q]$$$). For every such query, you have to do the following:replace the element $$$a_{x, y}$$$ with $$$c$$$;count the number of connected components in the matrix.There is one additional constraint: for every $$$i \\\\in [1, q - 1]$$$, $$$c_i \\\\le c_{i + 1}$$$.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 300$$$, $$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^6$$$) â€” the number of rows, the number of columns and the number of queries, respectively.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, each representing a query. The $$$i$$$-th line contains three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ and $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$1 \\\\le y_i \\\\le m$$$, $$$1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le \\\\max(1000, \\\\lceil \\\\frac{2 \\\\cdot 10^6}{nm} \\\\rceil)$$$).
