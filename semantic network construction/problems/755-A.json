PolandBall and Hypothesistime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: \"There exists such a positive integernthat for each positive integermnumbern·m+ 1is a prime number\".Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for anyn.InputThe only number in the input isn(1 ≤n≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis.OutputOutput suchmthatn·m+ 1is not a prime number.
