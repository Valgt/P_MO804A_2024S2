Pencils and Boxestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMishka received a gift of multicolored pencils for his birthday! Unfortunately he lives in a monochrome world, where everything is of the same color and only saturation differs. This pack can be represented as a sequencea1,a2, ...,anofninteger numbers — saturation of the color of each pencil. Now Mishka wants to put all the mess in the pack in order. He has an infinite number of empty boxes to do this. He would like to fill some boxes in such a way that:Each pencil belongs toexactlyone box;Each non-empty box has at leastkpencils in it;If pencilsiandjbelong to the same box, then|ai-aj| ≤d, where|x|means absolute value ofx. Note that the opposite is optional, there can be pencilsiandjsuch that|ai-aj| ≤dand they belong to different boxes.Help Mishka to determine if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes. Print \"YES\" if there exists such a distribution. Otherwise print \"NO\".InputThe first line contains three integer numbersn,kandd(1 ≤k≤n≤ 5·105,0 ≤d≤ 109) — the number of pencils, minimal size of any non-empty box and maximal difference in saturation between any pair of pencils in the same box, respectively.The second line containsninteger numbersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — saturation of color of each pencil.OutputPrint \"YES\" if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes and satisfy all the conditions.

And you also can put all the pencils into the same box, difference of any pair in it won't exceed10.In the second example you can split pencils of saturations[4, 5, 3, 4]into2boxes of size2and put the remaining ones into another box.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "cbcac2c7", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of $n$ integers, representing the saturation of $n$ pencils.
