Promocodes with Mistakestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDuring a New Year special offer the \"Sudislavl Bars\" offerednpromo codes. Each promo code consists of exactly six digits and gives right to one free cocktail at the bar \"Mosquito Shelter\". Of course, all the promocodes differ.As the \"Mosquito Shelter\" opens only at 9, and partying in Sudislavl usually begins at as early as 6, many problems may arise as to how to type a promotional code without errors. It is necessary to calculate such maximumk, that the promotional code could be uniquely identified if it was typed with no more thankerrors. At that,k= 0means that the promotional codes must be entered exactly.A mistake in this problem should be considered as entering the wrong numbers. For example, value \"123465\" contains two errors relative to promocode \"123456\". Regardless of the number of errors the entered value consists of exactly six digits.InputThe first line of the output contains numbern(1 ≤n≤ 1000) — the number of promocodes.Each of the nextnlines contains a single promocode, consisting of exactly 6 digits. It is guaranteed that all the promocodes are distinct. Promocodes can start from digit \"0\".OutputPrint the maximumk(naturally, not exceeding the length of the promocode), such that any promocode can be uniquely identified if it is typed with at mostkmistakes.ExamplesInput2000000999999Output2Input6211111212111222111111111112111121111Output0NoteIn the first samplek< 3, so if a bar customer types in value \"090909\", then it will be impossible to define which promocode exactly corresponds to it.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b3a52cb5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ unique 6-digit codes.
