Three Activitiestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWinter holidays are coming up. They are going to last for $$$n$$$ days.During the holidays, Monocarp wants to try all of these activitiesexactly oncewith his friends:go skiing;watch a movie in a cinema;play board games.Monocarp knows that, on the $$$i$$$-th day, exactly $$$a_i$$$ friends will join him for skiing, $$$b_i$$$ friends will join him for a movie and $$$c_i$$$ friends will join him for board games.Monocarp also knows that he can't try more than one activity in a single day.Thus, he asks you to help him choose threedistinctdays $$$x, y, z$$$ in such a way that the total number of friends to join him for the activities ($$$a_x + b_y + c_z$$$) is maximized.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the duration of the winter holidays in days.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^8$$$) — the number of friends that will join Monocarp for skiing on the $$$i$$$-th day.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 10^8$$$) — the number of friends that will join Monocarp for a movie on the $$$i$$$-th day.The fourth line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le 10^8$$$) — the number of friends that will join Monocarp for board games on the $$$i$$$-th day.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum total number of friends that can join Monocarp for the activities on three distinct days.ExampleInput431 10 110 1 11 1 10430 20 10 130 5 15 2030 25 10 10105 19 12 3 18 18 6 17 10 1315 17 19 11 16 3 11 17 17 171 17 18 10 15 8 17 3 13 121017 5 4 18 12 4 11 2 16 168 4 14 19 3 12 6 7 5 163 4 8 11 10 8 10 2 20 3Output30 75 55 56NoteIn the first testcase, Monocarp can choose day $$$2$$$ for skiing, day $$$1$$$ for a movie and day $$$3$$$ for board games. This way, $$$a_2 = 10$$$ friends will join him for skiing, $$$b_1 = 10$$$ friends will join him for a movie and $$$c_3 = 10$$$ friends will join him for board games. The total number of friends is $$$30$$$.In the second testcase, Monocarp can choose day $$$1$$$ for skiing, day $$$4$$$ for a movie and day $$$2$$$ for board games. $$$30 + 20 + 25 = 75$$$ friends in total. Note that Monocarp can't choose day $$$1$$$ for all activities, because he can't try more than one activity in a single day.In the third testcase, Monocarp can choose day $$$2$$$ for skiing, day $$$3$$$ for a movie and day $$$7$$$ for board games. $$$19 + 19 + 17 = 55$$$ friends in total.In the fourth testcase, Monocarp can choose day $$$1$$$ for skiing, day $$$4$$$ for a movie and day $$$9$$$ for board games. $$$17 + 19 + 20 = 56$$$ friends in total.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "335d4224", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ days.
