Jeopardy of Dropped Ballstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid $$$a$$$ of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$Each cell $$$(x,y)$$$ contains an integer $$$a_{x,y}$$$ denoting the direction of how the ball will move.$$$a_{x,y}=1$$$ — the ball will move to the right (the next cell is $$$(x, y + 1)$$$);$$$a_{x,y}=2$$$ — the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is $$$(x + 1, y)$$$);$$$a_{x,y}=3$$$ — the ball will move to the left (the next cell is $$$(x, y - 1)$$$).Every time a ball leaves a cell $$$(x,y)$$$, the integer $$$a_{x,y}$$$ will change to $$$2$$$. Mr. Chanek will drop $$$k$$$ balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_k$$$-th ($$$1 \\\\leq c_i \\\\leq m$$$) columns.Determine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, m \\\\leq 1000$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\\\\ldots,a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_{i,j} \\\\leq 3$$$). It will satisfy $$$a_{i, 1} \\\\ne 3$$$ and $$$a_{i, m} \\\\ne 1$$$.The next line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq c_i \\\\leq m$$$) — the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.OutputOutput $$$k$$$ integers — the $$$i$$$-th integer denoting the column where the $$$i$$$-th ball will end.ExamplesInput5 5 3 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1Output2 2 1Input1 2 2 1 3 1 2Output1 2NoteIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ will change direction to the bottom direction.The second and third balls will drop as follows.All balls will be dropped from the first row and on the $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_k$$$-th columns respectively.
