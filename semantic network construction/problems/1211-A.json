Three Problemstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp is choosing three problems for creating a programming test. Totally he has $$$n$$$ problems in his list. The complexity of the $$$i$$$-th problem equals $$$r_i$$$. All problems are numerated from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.Help Polycarp to choose such three problems $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$, so that the complexity of the first problem strictly less than the complexity of second problem and the complexity of the second problem is strictly less than the complexity of the third problem. So, for chosen problems $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ it should be true that $$$r_a < r_b < r_c$$$.If Polycarp can choose three problems in different ways, you can print any of them.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 3000$$$) â€” the number of problems in Polycarp's list.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \\\\dots, r_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le r_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$r_i$$$ is the complexity of the $$$i$$$-th problem.OutputIf Polycarp has no ways to choose three problems, you should print three numbers-1. Ih there is a way to choose them, you should print three different integers $$$a, b, c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b, c \\\\le n$$$), where $$$a$$$ is the number of the first chosen problem, $$$b$$$ is the number of the second chosen problem and $$$c$$$ is the number of the third chosen problem.ExamplesInput6 3 1 4 1 5 9Output4 1 3Input5 1 1000000000 1 1000000000 1Output-1 -1 -1Input9 10 10 11 10 10 10 10 10 1Output9 8 3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "243e43dc", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of $n$ problems, each with a complexity rating $r_i$.
