There are two types of operations with it:inc(lf,rg,v)— this operation increases each element on the segment[lf,rg](inclusively) byv;rmq(lf,rg)— this operation returns minimal value on the segment[lf,rg](inclusively).Assume segments to be circular, so ifn= 5andlf= 3,rg= 1, it means the index sequence:3, 4, 0, 1.Write program to process given sequence of operations.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 200000).
