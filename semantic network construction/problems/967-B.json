Watering Systemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputArkady wants to water his only flower. Unfortunately, he has a very poor watering system that was designed for $$$n$$$ flowers and so it looks like a pipe with $$$n$$$ holes. Arkady can only use the water that flows from the first hole.Arkady can block some of the holes, and then pour $$$A$$$ liters of water into the pipe. After that, the water will flow out from the non-blocked holes proportionally to their sizes $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_n$$$. In other words, if the sum of sizes of non-blocked holes is $$$S$$$, and the $$$i$$$-th hole is not blocked, $$$\\\\frac{s_i \\\\cdot A}{S}$$$ liters of water will flow out of it.What is the minimum number of holes Arkady should block to make at least $$$B$$$ liters of water flow out of the first hole?InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\\\le B \\\\le A \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of holes, the volume of water Arkady will pour into the system, and the volume he wants to get out of the first hole.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le s_i \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the sizes of the holes.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of holes Arkady should block.ExamplesInput4 10 32 2 2 2Output1Input4 80 203 2 1 4Output0Input5 10 101000 1 1 1 1Output4NoteIn the first example Arkady should block at least one hole. After that, $$$\\\\frac{10 \\\\cdot 2}{6} \\\\approx 3.333$$$ liters of water will flow out of the first hole, and that suits Arkady.In the second example even without blocking any hole, $$$\\\\frac{80 \\\\cdot 3}{10} = 24$$$ liters will flow out of the first hole, that is not less than $$$20$$$.In the third example Arkady has to block all holes except the first to make all water flow out of the first hole.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "57b29556", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have a pipe with $n$ holes.
