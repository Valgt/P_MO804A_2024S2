Petya and Posttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLittle Vasya's uncle is a postman. The post offices are located on one circular road. Besides, each post office has its own gas station located next to it. Petya's uncle works as follows: in the morning he should leave the house and go to some post office. In the office he receives a portion of letters and a car. Then he must drive in the given car exactly one round along the circular road and return to the starting post office (the uncle can drive along the circle in any direction, counterclockwise or clockwise). Besides, since the car belongs to the city post, it should also be fuelled with gasoline only at the Post Office stations.The total number of stations equals ton. One can fuel the car at thei-th station with no more thanailiters of gasoline. Besides, one can fuel the car no more than once at each station. Also, the distance between the1-st and the2-nd station isb1kilometers, the distance between the2-nd and the3-rd one isb2kilometers, ..., between the(n- 1)-th and then-th ones the distance isbn- 1kilometers and between then-th and the1-st one the distance isbnkilometers. Petya's uncle's high-tech car uses only one liter of gasoline per kilometer. It is known that the stations are located so that the sum of allaiis equal to the sum of allbi. Thei-th gas station andi-th post office are very close, so the distance between them is0kilometers.Thus, it becomes clear that if we start from some post offices, then it is not always possible to drive one round along a circular road. The uncle faces the following problem: to what stations can he go in the morning to be able to ride exactly one circle along the circular road and visit all the post offices that are on it?Petya, who used to attend programming classes, has volunteered to help his uncle, but his knowledge turned out to be not enough, so he asks you to help him write the program that will solve the posed problem.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105). The second line containsnintegersai— amount of gasoline on thei-th station. The third line containsnintegersb1,b2, ...,bn. They are the distances between the1-st and the2-nd gas stations, between the2-nd and the3-rd ones, ..., between then-th and the1-st ones, respectively. The sum of allbiequals to the sum of allaiand is no more than109. Each of the numbersai,biis no less than1and no more than109.OutputPrint on the first line the numberk— the number of possible post offices, from which the car can drive one circle along a circular road.
