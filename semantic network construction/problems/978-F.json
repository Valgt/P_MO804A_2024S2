For each programmer $$$i$$$, find the number of programmers, for which the programmer $$$i$$$ can be a mentor.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le \\\\min(2 \\\\cdot 10^5, \\\\frac{n \\\\cdot (n - 1)}{2}))$$$ — total number of programmers and number of pairs of programmers which are in a quarrel.The second line contains a sequence of integers $$$r_1, r_2, \\\\dots, r_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le r_i \\\\le 10^{9})$$$, where $$$r_i$$$ equals to the skill of the $$$i$$$-th programmer.Each of the following $$$k$$$ lines contains two distinct integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le x, y \\\\le n$$$, $$$x \\\\ne y)$$$ — pair of programmers in a quarrel. The pairs are unordered, it means that if $$$x$$$ is in a quarrel with $$$y$$$ then $$$y$$$ is in a quarrel with $$$x$$$. Guaranteed, that for each pair $$$(x, y)$$$ there are no other pairs $$$(x, y)$$$ and $$$(y, x)$$$ in the input.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers, the $$$i$$$-th number should be equal to the number of programmers, for which the $$$i$$$-th programmer can be a mentor. Programmers are numbered in the same order that their skills are given in the input.ExamplesInput4 210 4 10 151 24 3Output0 0 1 2Input10 45 4 1 5 4 3 7 1 2 54 62 110 83 5Output5 4 0 5 3 3 9 0 2 5NoteIn the first example, the first programmer can not be mentor of any other (because only the second programmer has a skill, lower than first programmer skill, but they are in a quarrel). The second programmer can not be mentor of any other programmer, because his skill is minimal among others. The third programmer can be a mentor of the second programmer. The fourth programmer can be a mentor of the first and of the second programmers. He can not be a mentor of the third programmer, because they are in a quarrel.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b76d68ef", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of $n$ programmers, each with a skill level $r_i$.
