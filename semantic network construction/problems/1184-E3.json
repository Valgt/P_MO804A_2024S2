Daleks' Invasion (hard)time limit per test10 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWith your help, Heidi has prepared a plan of trap placement and defence. Yet suddenly, the Doctor popped out of the TARDIS and told her that he had spied on the Daleks' preparations, and there is more of them than ever. Desperate times require desperate measures, so Heidi is going to risk meeting with the Daleks and she will consider placing a trap alonganyCorridor.This means she needs your help again in calculating $$$E_{max}(c)$$$ – the largest $$$e \\\\le 10^9$$$ such that if we changed the energy requirement of $$$c$$$ to $$$e$$$, then the Daleks might use $$$c$$$ in their invasion – but this time for all Time Corridors.InputFirst line: number $$$n$$$ of destinations, number $$$m$$$ of corridors ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$, $$$n - 1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 10^6$$$).
