Computer Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.A level is a rectangular grid of $$$2$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ — at the intersection of the $$$1$$$-st row and the $$$1$$$-st column.Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ to cell $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ in one step if $$$|x_1 - x_2| \\\\le 1$$$ and $$$|y_1 - y_2| \\\\le 1$$$. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.To complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell $$$(2, n)$$$ — at the intersection of row $$$2$$$ and column $$$n$$$.Help Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of columns.The next two lines describe the level. The $$$i$$$-th of these lines describes the $$$i$$$-th line of the level — the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.Additional constraint on the input: cells $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(2, n)$$$ are safe.OutputFor each test case, outputYESif it is possible to complete the level, andNOotherwise.ExampleInput4 3 000 000 4 0011 1100 4 0111 1110 6 010101 101010OutputYES YES NO YESNoteConsider the example from the statement.In the first test case, one of the possible paths is $$$(1, 1) \\\\rightarrow (2, 2) \\\\rightarrow (2, 3)$$$.In the second test case, one of the possible paths is $$$(1, 1) \\\\rightarrow (1, 2) \\\\rightarrow (2, 3) \\\\rightarrow (2, 4)$$$.In the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is $$$(1, 1) \\\\rightarrow (2, 2) \\\\rightarrow (1, 3) \\\\rightarrow (2, 4) \\\\rightarrow (1, 5) \\\\rightarrow (2, 6)$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "fb3e51a9", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a 2xN grid where some cells are traps.
