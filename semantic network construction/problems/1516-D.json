Cuttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis time Baby Ehab will only cut and not stick. He starts with a piece of paper with an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ written on it, and then he does the following:he picks a range $$$(l, r)$$$ and cuts the subsegment $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\\\ldots, a_r$$$ out, removing the rest of the array.he then cuts this range into multiple subranges.to add a number theory spice to it, he requires that the elements of every subrange must have their product equal to theirleast common multiple (LCM).Formally, he partitions the elements of $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\\\ldots, a_r$$$ into contiguous subarrays such that the product of every subarray is equal to its LCM. Now, for $$$q$$$ independent ranges $$$(l, r)$$$, tell Baby Ehab the minimum number of subarrays he needs.InputThe first line contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n,q \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\\\\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$) — the endpoints of this query's interval.OutputFor each query, print its answer on a new line.ExampleInput6 3 2 3 10 7 5 14 1 6 2 4 3 5Output3 1 2NoteThe first query asks about the whole array. You can partition it into $$$[2]$$$, $$$[3,10,7]$$$, and $$$[5,14]$$$. The first subrange has product and LCM equal to $$$2$$$. The second has product and LCM equal to $$$210$$$. And the third has product and LCM equal to $$$70$$$. Another possible partitioning is $$$[2,3]$$$, $$$[10,7]$$$, and $$$[5,14]$$$.The second query asks about the range $$$(2,4)$$$. Its product is equal to its LCM, so you don't need to partition it further.The last query asks about the range $$$(3,5)$$$. You can partition it into $$$[10,7]$$$ and $$$[5]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "62cf55db", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a$ of length $n$.
