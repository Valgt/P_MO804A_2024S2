Find a permutation $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$ with the maximum possible value among all permutations of size $$$n$$$. If there are several such permutations, you can print any of them.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 97$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$).OutputFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers — the permutation $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$ with the maximum possible value among all permutations of size $$$n$$$.ExampleInput3456Output2 1 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 4 5 1 2 3 6", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2dbc23b9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$.
