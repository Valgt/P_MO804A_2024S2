The $$$i$$$-th segment is given as a pair $$$l_i, r_i$$$, where $$$l_i$$$ is the position of the left end of the $$$i$$$-th segment and $$$r_i$$$ is the position of the right end of the $$$i$$$-th segment. Segments may intersect, overlap, or even coincide. A segment is a set of numbers (including floating-point numbers) lying between the segment ends or coinciding with them. Formally, the segment $$$[l, r]=\\\\{x~|~x \\\\in \\\\Bbb{R},~l \\\\le x \\\\le r\\\\}$$$.Let theunion of segmentsbe the set of all axis points covered by the set of segments.
