Recall that a permutation of length $$$m$$$ is a sequence of $$$m$$$distinctintegers from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$.Let the beauty of a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_m$$$ be the largest $$$k$$$ such that $$$p_1 = 1, p_2 = 2, \\\\dots, p_k = k$$$. If $$$p_1 \\\\neq 1$$$, then the beauty is $$$0$$$.The product of two permutations $$$p \\\\cdot q$$$ is a permutation $$$r$$$ such that $$$r_j = q_{p_j}$$$.For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, print the largest beauty of a permutation $$$a_i \\\\cdot a_j$$$ over all $$$j$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (possibly, $$$i = j$$$).InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$; $$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 10$$$) — the number of permutations and the length of each permutation.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains a permutation $$$a_i$$$ — $$$m$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$.The sum of $$$n$$$ doesn't exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$ over all testcases.OutputFor each testcase, print $$$n$$$ integers.
