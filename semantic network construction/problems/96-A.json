Footballtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutPetya loves football very much. One day, as he was watching a football match, he was writing the players' current positions on a piece of paper. To simplify the situation he depicted it as a string consisting of zeroes and ones. A zero corresponds to players of one team; a one corresponds to players of another team. If there are at least7players of some team standing one after another, then the situation is considered dangerous. For example, the situation00100110111111101is dangerous and11110111011101is not. You are given the current situation. Determine whether it is dangerous or not.InputThe first input line contains a non-empty string consisting of characters \"0\" and \"1\", which represents players. The length of the string does not exceed100characters. There's at least one player from each team present on the field.OutputPrint \"YES\" if the situation is dangerous.
