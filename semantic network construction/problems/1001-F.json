Distinguish multi-qubit basis statestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are givenNqubits which are guaranteed to be in one of two basis states onNqubits. You are also given two bitstringsbits0andbits1which describe these basis states.Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 0 if it was the state described withbits0or 1 if it was the state described withbits1. The state of the qubits after the operations does not matter.InputYou have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:an array of qubitsqs,two arrays of boolean valuesbits0andbits1, representing the basis states in which the qubits can be. These arrays will have the same length as the array of qubits.bits0andbits1will differ in at least one position.An array of boolean values represents a basis state as follows: thei-th element of the array is true if thei-th qubit is in state, and false if it is in state. For example, array [true; false] describes 2-qubit state.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;operation Solve (qs : Qubit[], bits0 : Bool[], bits1 : Bool[]) : Int{body{// your code here}}}", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "388bc4f8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of $N$ qubits.
