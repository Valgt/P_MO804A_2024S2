Frets On Firetime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMiyako came to the flea kingdom with a ukulele. She became good friends with local flea residents and played beautiful music for them every day.In return, the fleas made a bigger ukulele for her: it has $$$n$$$strings, and each string has $$$(10^{18} + 1)$$$fretsnumerated from $$$0$$$ to $$$10^{18}$$$. The fleas use the array $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_n$$$ to describe the ukulele's tuning, that is, thepitchof the $$$j$$$-th fret on the $$$i$$$-th string is the integer $$$s_i + j$$$.Miyako is about to leave the kingdom, but the fleas hope that Miyako will answer some last questions for them.Each question is in the form of: \"How many different pitches are there, if we consider frets between $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ (inclusive) on all strings?\"Miyako is about to visit the cricket kingdom and has no time to answer all the questions. Please help her with this task!Formally, you are given a matrix with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$(10^{18}+1)$$$ columns, where the cell in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column ($$$0 \\\\le j \\\\le 10^{18}$$$) contains the integer $$$s_i + j$$$. You are to answer $$$q$$$ queries, in the $$$k$$$-th query you have to answer the number of distinct integers in the matrix from the $$$l_k$$$-th to the $$$r_k$$$-th columns, inclusive.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100\\\\,000$$$) — the number of strings.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq s_i \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$) — the tuning of the ukulele.The third line contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq q \\\\leq 100\\\\,000$$$) — the number of questions.The $$$k$$$-th among the following $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_k$$$，$$$r_k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq l_k \\\\leq r_k \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$) — a question from the fleas.OutputOutput one number for each question, separated by spaces — the number of different pitches.ExamplesInput63 1 4 1 5 937 70 28 17Output5 10 18Input21 50000000000000000021000000000000000000 10000000000000000000 1000000000000000000Output2 1500000000000000000NoteFor the first example, the pitches on the $$$6$$$ strings are as follows.$$$$$$ \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\textbf{Fret} & \\\\textbf{0} & \\\\textbf{1} & \\\\textbf{2} & \\\\textbf{3} & \\\\textbf{4} & \\\\textbf{5} & \\\\textbf{6} & \\\\textbf{7} & \\\\ldots \\\\\\\\ s_1: & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\ s_2: & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\ s_3: & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\ s_4: & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\ s_5: & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\ s_6: & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & \\\\dots \\\\end{matrix} $$$$$$There are $$$5$$$ different pitches on fret $$$7$$$ — $$$8, 10, 11, 12, 16$$$.There are $$$10$$$ different pitches on frets $$$0, 1, 2$$$ — $$$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1bd77617", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a matrix with $n$ rows and $10^{18} + 1$ columns.
