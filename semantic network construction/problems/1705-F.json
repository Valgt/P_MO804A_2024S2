Mark and the Online Examtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMark is administering an online exam consisting of $$$n$$$ true-false questions. However, he has lost all answer keys. He needs a way to retrieve the answers before his client gets infuriated.Fortunately, he has access to the grading system. Thus, for each query, you can input the answers to all $$$n$$$ questions, and the grading system will output how many of them are correct.He doesn't have much time, so he can use the grading system at most $$$675$$$ times. Help Mark determine the answer keys.Note that answer keys are fixed in advance and will not change depending on your queries.InputThe first line of the input consists of an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of questions.InteractionAfter reading $$$n$$$, you can start making queries to the grading system. For each query, print a line containing a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of only letters 'T' and 'F'.$$$s_i = $$$'T' means that you answer the $$$i$$$-questiontrue.$$$s_i = $$$'F' means that you answer the $$$i$$$-questionfalse.After a successful query, you should read an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\\\leq k\\\\leq n$$$) — the number of correct answers.If you read $$$n$$$, then you found the answers, and your program should not make any more queries.If your program reads $$$k = -1$$$ instead of the number of correct answers, it means that you either made an invalid query or exceeded the query limits. Exit immediately after receiving $$$-1$$$, and you will seeWrong answerverdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will getIdleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:fflush(stdout)orcout.flush()in C++;System.out.flush()in Java;flush(output)in Pascal;stdout.flush()in Python;see documentation for other languages.HacksTo hack, use the following format:The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of questions.The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of only 'T' and 'F' — the answer key.ExamplesInput3  1  3OutputFTT  TTFInput4  0  3  4OutputFTFF  TTTT  TFTTNoteThe empty lines in the example are just for you to better understand the interaction process.You're not required to print them.In the first example, there are $$$3$$$ questions, and the answer to each question is 'true', 'true', and 'false', respectively.The first query, guessing the answers to be 'false', 'true', and 'true', respectively, guesses only one question — the $$$2$$$-nd question — correctly.Then, in the second query, the program correctly guesses the answer key. The interaction ends here.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ questions, and the answer to each question is 'true', 'false', 'true', and 'true', respectively.The first query guessed none of the questions correctly, resulting in the answer $$$0$$$.The second query guessed the $$$1$$$-st, $$$3$$$-rd, and $$$4$$$-th question correctly, resulting in the answer $$$3$$$.In the third query, the program correctly guesses the answer key.
