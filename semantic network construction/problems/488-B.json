Candy Boxestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThere is an old tradition of keeping4boxes of candies in the house in Cyberland. The numbers of candies arespecialif theirarithmetic mean, theirmedianand theirrangeare all equal. By definition, for a set{x1,x2,x3,x4}(x1≤x2≤x3≤x4)arithmetic meanis,medianisandrangeisx4-x1.The arithmetic mean and median are not necessary integer.It is well-known that if those three numbers are same, boxes will create a \"debugging field\" and codes in the field will have no bugs.For example,1, 1, 3, 3is the example of4numbers meeting the condition because their mean, median and range are all equal to2.Jeff has4special boxes of candies. However, something bad has happened! Some of the boxes could have been lost and now there are onlyn(0 ≤n≤ 4) boxes remaining. Thei-th remaining box containsaicandies.Now Jeff wants to know: is there a possible way to find the number of candies of the4 -nmissing boxes, meeting the condition above (the mean, median and range are equal)?InputThe first line of input contains an only integern(0 ≤n≤ 4).The nextnlines contain integersai, denoting the number of candies in thei-th box (1 ≤ai≤ 500).OutputIn the first output line, print \"YES\" if a solution exists, or print \"NO\" if there is no solution.If a solution exists, you should output4 -nmore lines, each line containing an integerb, denoting the number of candies in a missing box.All your numbersbmust satisfy inequality1 ≤b≤ 106. It is guaranteed that if there exists a positive integer solution, you can always find suchb's meeting the condition. If there are multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them.Given numbersaimay follow in any order in the input, not necessary in non-decreasing.aimay have stood at any positions in the original set, not necessary on lowestnfirst positions.ExamplesInput211OutputYES33Input3111OutputNOInput41223OutputYESNoteFor the first sample, the numbers of candies in4boxes can be1, 1, 3, 3.
