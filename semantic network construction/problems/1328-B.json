K-th Beautiful Stringtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor the given integer $$$n$$$ ($$$n > 2$$$) let's write down all the strings of length $$$n$$$ which contain $$$n-2$$$ letters 'a' and two letters 'b' inlexicographical(alphabetical) order.Recall that the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$, if there exists such $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$), that $$$s_i < t_i$$$, and for any $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le j < i$$$) $$$s_j = t_j$$$. The lexicographic comparison of strings is implemented by the operator<in modern programming languages.For example, if $$$n=5$$$ the strings are (the order does matter):aaabbaababaabbaabaabababaabbaabaaabbaabababaabbaaaIt is easy to show that such a list of strings will contain exactly $$$\\\\frac{n \\\\cdot (n-1)}{2}$$$ strings.You are given $$$n$$$ ($$$n > 2$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le \\\\frac{n \\\\cdot (n-1)}{2}$$$). Print the $$$k$$$-th string from the list.InputThe input contains one or more test cases.The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases in the test. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case is written on the the separate line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5, 1 \\\\le k \\\\le \\\\min(2\\\\cdot10^9, \\\\frac{n \\\\cdot (n-1)}{2})$$$.The sum of values $$$n$$$ over all test cases in the test doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print the $$$k$$$-th string from the list of all described above strings of length $$$n$$$. Strings in the list are sorted lexicographically (alphabetically).ExampleInput7 5 1 5 2 5 8 5 10 3 1 3 2 20 100Outputaaabb aabab baaba bbaaa abb bab aaaaabaaaaabaaaaaaaa", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6ca7c5e1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer  $n$ ($n > 2$) and an integer $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$). \n\nYou need to find the $k$-th lexicographically smallest string of length $n$ that contains $n-2$ 'a's and two 'b's.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf $n = 5$ and $k = 3$, the answer is \"baaba\". \n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like help with the algorithm to solve this problem!"}, {"prompt_md5": "adc1e1c0", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a number 'n' and a number 'k'.
