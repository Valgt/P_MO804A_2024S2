Swap Gametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob are playing a game on an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. Alice and Bob make alternating moves with Alice going first.In his/her turn, the player makes the following move:If $$$a_1 = 0$$$, the player loses the game, otherwise:Player chooses some $$$i$$$ with $$$2\\\\le i \\\\le n$$$. Then player decreases the value of $$$a_1$$$ by $$$1$$$ and swaps $$$a_1$$$ with $$$a_i$$$.Determine the winner of the game if both players play optimally.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^4)$$$  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5)$$$  — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2 \\\\ldots a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9)$$$  — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, if Alice will win the game, output \"Alice\". Otherwise, output \"Bob\".You can output each letter in any case.
