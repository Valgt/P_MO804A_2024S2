Bestietime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$. Friends asked you to make thegreatest common divisor (GCD)of all numbers in the array equal to $$$1$$$. In one operation, you can do the following:Select an arbitrary index in the array $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$;Make $$$a_i = \\\\gcd(a_i, i)$$$, where $$$\\\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the GCD of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. The cost of such an operation is $$$n - i + 1$$$.You need to find the minimum total cost of operations we need to perform so that the GCD of the all array numbers becomes equal to $$$1$$$.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 5\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 20$$$) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum total cost of operations that will need to be performed so that the GCD of all numbers in the array becomes equal to $$$1$$$.We can show that it's always possible to do so.ExampleInput9111222 433 6 945 10 15 205120 60 80 40 806150 90 180 120 60 3062 4 6 9 12 18630 60 90 120 125 125Output0 1 2 2 1 3 3 0 1NoteIn the first test case, the GCD of the entire array is already equal to $$$1$$$, so there is no need to perform operations.In the second test case, select $$$i = 1$$$. After this operation, $$$a_1 = \\\\gcd(2, 1) = 1$$$. The cost of this operation is $$$1$$$.In the third test case, you can select $$$i = 1$$$, after that the array $$$a$$$ will be equal to $$$[1, 4]$$$. The GCD of this array is $$$1$$$, and the total cost is $$$2$$$.In the fourth test case, you can select $$$i = 2$$$, after that the array $$$a$$$ will be equal to $$$[3, 2, 9]$$$. The GCD of this array is $$$1$$$, and the total cost is $$$2$$$.In the sixth test case, you can select $$$i = 4$$$ and $$$i = 5$$$, after that the array $$$a$$$ will be equal to $$$[120, 60, 80, 4, 5]$$$. The GCD of this array is $$$1$$$, and the total cost is $$$3$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4d257e44", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
