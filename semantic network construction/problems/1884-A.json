Simple Designtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA positive integer is called $$$k$$$-beautiful, if the digit sum of the decimal representation of this number is divisible by $$$k^{\\\\dagger}$$$. For example, $$$9272$$$ is $$$5$$$-beautiful, since the digit sum of $$$9272$$$ is $$$9 + 2 + 7 + 2 = 20$$$.You are given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$. Please find the smallest integer $$$y \\\\ge x$$$ which is $$$k$$$-beautiful.$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$ An integer $$$n$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$ if there exists an integer $$$m$$$ such that $$$n = k \\\\cdot m$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10$$$).OutputFor each test case, output the smallest integer $$$y \\\\ge x$$$ which is $$$k$$$-beautiful.ExampleInput61 510 837 9777 31235 101 10Output5 17 45 777 1243 19NoteIn the first test case, numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ consist of a single digit, thus the digit sum is equal to the number itself. None of the integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ are divisible by $$$5$$$.In the fourth test case, the digit sum of $$$777$$$ is $$$7 + 7 + 7 = 21$$$ which is already divisible by $$$3$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5a15835a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "A positive integer is called $k$-beautiful if the sum of its digits is divisible by $k$. \n\nYou are given two integers $x$ and $k$.
