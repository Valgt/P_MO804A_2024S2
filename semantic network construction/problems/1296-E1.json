String Coloring (easy version)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an easy version of the problem. The actual problems are different, but the easy version is almost a subtask of the hard version. Note that the constraints and the output format are different.You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters.You have to colorallits charactersone of the two colors(each character to exactly one color, the same letters can be colored the same or different colors, i.e. you can choose exactly one color for each index in $$$s$$$).After coloring, you can swapanytwo neighboring characters of the string that are coloreddifferentcolors. You can perform such an operation arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times.The goal is to make the string sorted, i.e. all characters should be in alphabetical order.Your task is to say if it is possible to color the given string so that after coloring it can become sorted bysomesequence of swaps. Note that you have to restore only coloring, not the sequence of swaps.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 200$$$) â€” the length of $$$s$$$.The second line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting of exactly $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters.OutputIf it is impossible to color the given string so that after coloring it can become sorted bysomesequence of swaps, print \"NO\" (without quotes) in the first line.Otherwise, print \"YES\" in the first line andanycorrect coloring in the second line (the coloring is the string consisting of $$$n$$$ characters, the $$$i$$$-th character should be '0' if the $$$i$$$-th character is colored the first color and '1' otherwise).ExamplesInput9 abacbecfdOutputYES 001010101Input8 aaabbcbbOutputYES 01011011Input7 abcdedcOutputNOInput5 abcdeOutputYES 00000", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1b162e37", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string of lowercase letters.
