Network Coveragetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe government of Berland decided to improve network coverage in his country. Berland has a unique structure: the capital in the center and $$$n$$$ citiesin a circlearound the capital. The capital already has a good network coverage (so the government ignores it), but the $$$i$$$-th city contains $$$a_i$$$ households that require a connection.The government designed a plan to build $$$n$$$ network stations between all pairs of neighboring cities which will maintain connections only for these cities. In other words, the $$$i$$$-th network station will provide service only for the $$$i$$$-th and the $$$(i + 1)$$$-th city (the $$$n$$$-th station is connected to the $$$n$$$-th and the $$$1$$$-st city).All network stations have capacities: the $$$i$$$-th station can provide the connection to at most $$$b_i$$$ households.Now the government asks you to check can the designed stations meet the needs of all cities or not — that is, is it possible to assign each household a network station so that each network station $$$i$$$ provides the connection to at most $$$b_i$$$ households.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the number of cities and stations.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the number of households in the $$$i$$$-th city.The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the capacities of the designed stations.It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, printYES, if the designed stations can meet the needs of all cities, orNOotherwise (case insensitive).ExampleInput5 3 2 3 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 4 4 2 3 4 5 3 7 2 2 4 4 5 2 3 2 3 2 7 2 1 1 10 10OutputYES YES NO YES YESNoteIn the first test case:the first network station can provide $$$2$$$ connections to the first city and $$$1$$$ connection to the second city;the second station can provide $$$2$$$ connections to the second city and $$$1$$$ connection to the third city;the third station can provide $$$3$$$ connections to the third city.In the second test case:the $$$1$$$-st station can provide $$$2$$$ connections to the $$$1$$$-st city;the $$$2$$$-nd station can provide $$$3$$$ connections to the $$$2$$$-nd city;the $$$3$$$-rd station can provide $$$3$$$ connections to the $$$3$$$-rd city and $$$1$$$ connection to the $$$1$$$-st station.In the third test case, the fourth city needs $$$5$$$ connections, but the third and the fourth station has $$$4$$$ connections in total.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e674aa02", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ cities arranged in a circle.
