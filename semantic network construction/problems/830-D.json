Singer Housetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt is known that passages in Singer house are complex and intertwined. Let's define a Singerk-house as a graph built by the following process: take complete binary tree of heightkand add edges from each vertex to all its successors, if they are not yet present.Singer4-houseCount the number of non-empty paths in Singerk-house which do not pass the same vertex twice. Two paths are distinct if the sets or the orders of visited vertices are different. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo109+ 7.InputThe only line contains single integerk(1 ≤k≤ 400).OutputPrint single integer — the answer for the task modulo109+ 7.ExamplesInput2Output9Input3Output245Input20Output550384565NoteThere are9paths in the first example (the vertices are numbered on the picture below):1,2,3,1-2,2-1,1-3,3-1,2-1-3,3-1-2.Singer2-house", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "349388f6", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $k$ (where $1 \\le k \\le 400$).  \n\nConsider a tree structure built as follows:\n\n1.
