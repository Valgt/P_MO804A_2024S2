Right Left Wrongtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVlad found a strip of $$$n$$$ cells, numbered from left to right from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. In the $$$i$$$-th cell, there is a positive integer $$$a_i$$$ and a letter $$$s_i$$$, where all $$$s_i$$$ are either 'L' or 'R'.Vlad invites you to try to score the maximum possible points by performing any (possibly zero) number of operations.In one operation, you can choose two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l < r \\\\le n$$$) such that $$$s_l$$$ = 'L' and $$$s_r$$$ = 'R' and do the following:add $$$a_l + a_{l + 1} + \\\\dots + a_{r - 1} + a_r$$$ points to the current score;replace $$$s_i$$$ with '.' for all $$$l \\\\le i \\\\le r$$$, meaning you can no longer choose these indices.For example, consider the following strip:$$$3$$$$$$5$$$$$$1$$$$$$4$$$$$$3$$$$$$2$$$LRLLLRYou can first choose $$$l = 1$$$, $$$r = 2$$$ and add $$$3 + 5 = 8$$$ to your score.$$$3$$$$$$5$$$$$$1$$$$$$4$$$$$$3$$$$$$2$$$..LLLRThen choose $$$l = 3$$$, $$$r = 6$$$ and add $$$1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 10$$$ to your score.$$$3$$$$$$5$$$$$$1$$$$$$4$$$$$$3$$$$$$2$$$......As a result, it is impossible to perform another operation, and the final score is $$$18$$$.What is the maximum score that can be achieved?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the strip.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the numbers written on the strip.The third line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters 'L' and 'R'.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one integer — the maximum possible number of points that can be scored.ExampleInput463 5 1 4 3 2LRLLLR22 8LR23 9RL51 2 3 4 5LRLRROutput18 10 0 22", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "92389bb1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and a sequence of characters $s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$ where each character is either 'L' or 'R'.
