Magic Gridtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet us define amagicgrid to be a square matrix of integers of size $$$n \\\\times n$$$, satisfying the following conditions.All integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$(n^2 - 1)$$$ inclusive appear in the matrixexactly once.Bitwise XORof all elements in a row or a column must be the same for each row and column.You are given an integer $$$n$$$ which is amultiple of $$$4$$$. Construct amagicgrid of size $$$n \\\\times n$$$.InputThe only line of input contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1000$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is a multiple of $$$4$$$.OutputPrint amagicgrid, i.e. $$$n$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers, representing the $$$i$$$-th row of the grid.If there are multiple answers, print any. We can show that an answer always exists.ExamplesInput4Output8 9 1 13 3 12 7 5 0 2 4 11 6 10 15 14Input8Output19 55 11 39 32 36 4 52 51 7 35 31 12 48 28 20 43 23 59 15 0 8 16 44 3 47 27 63 24 40 60 56 34 38 6 54 17 53 9 37 14 50 30 22 49 5 33 29 2 10 18 46 41 21 57 13 26 42 62 58 1 45 25 61NoteIn the first example, XOR of each row and each column is $$$13$$$.In the second example, XOR of each row and each column is $$$60$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "113c4096", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$ that is a multiple of 4.
