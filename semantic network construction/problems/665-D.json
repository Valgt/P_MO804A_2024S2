Simple Subsettime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA tuple of positive integers{x1,x2, ...,xk}is called simple if for all pairs of positive integers(i,j)(1  ≤i<j≤k),xi+xjis a prime.You are given an arrayawithnpositive integersa1,a2,  ...,an(not necessary distinct). You want to find a simple subset of the arrayawith the maximum size.A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than1that has no positive divisors other than1and itself.Let's define a subset of the arrayaas a tuple that can be obtained fromaby removing some (possibly all) elements of it.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 1000) — the number of integers in the arraya.The second line containsnintegersai(1 ≤ai≤ 106) — the elements of the arraya.OutputOn the first line print integerm— the maximum possible size of simple subset ofa.On the second line printmintegersbl— the elements of the simple subset of the arrayawith the maximum size.If there is more than one solution you can print any of them.
