Clique in the Divisibility Graphtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAs you must know, the maximum clique problem in an arbitrary graph isNP-hard. Nevertheless, for some graphs of specific kinds it can be solved effectively.Just in case, let us remind you that a clique in a non-directed graph is a subset of the vertices of a graph, such that any two vertices of this subset are connected by an edge. In particular, an empty set of vertexes and a set consisting of a single vertex, are cliques.Let's define a divisibility graph for a set of positive integersA= {a1,a2, ...,an}as follows. The vertices of the given graph are numbers from setA, and two numbersaiandaj(i≠j) are connected by an edge if and only if eitheraiis divisible byaj, orajis divisible byai.You are given a set of non-negative integersA. Determine the size of a maximum clique in a divisibility graph for setA.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 106), that sets the size of setA.The second line containsndistinct positive integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 106) — elements of subsetA. The numbers in the line follow in the ascending order.OutputPrint a single number — the maximum size of a clique in a divisibility graph for setA.ExamplesInput83 4 6 8 10 18 21 24Output3NoteIn the first sample test a clique of size 3 is, for example, a subset of vertexes{3, 6, 18}.
