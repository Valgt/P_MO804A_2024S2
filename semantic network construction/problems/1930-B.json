For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$.If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.ExampleInput243Output4 1 2 3 1 2 3NoteIn the first test case, $$$p=[4,1,2,3]$$$ is a valid permutation. However, the permutation $$$p=[1,2,3,4]$$$ is not a valid permutation as we can choose $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=3$$$. Then $$$p_1=1$$$ divides $$$p_3=3$$$ and $$$p_2=2$$$ divides $$$p_4=4$$$. Note that the permutation $$$p=[3, 4, 2, 1]$$$ is also not a valid permutation as we can choose $$$i=3$$$ and $$$j=2$$$. Then $$$p_3=2$$$ divides $$$p_2=4$$$ and $$$p_4=1$$$ divides $$$p_3=2$$$.In the second test case, $$$p=[1,2,3]$$$ is a valid permutation.
