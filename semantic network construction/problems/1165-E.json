Two Arrays and Sum of Functionstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$n$$$.Let's define a function $$$f(l, r) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{l \\\\le i \\\\le r} a_i \\\\cdot b_i$$$.Your task is to reorder the elements (choose an arbitrary order of elements) of the array $$$b$$$ to minimize the value of $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n} f(l, r)$$$. Since the answer can be very large, you have to print it modulo $$$998244353$$$. Note that you shouldminimize the answer but not its remainder.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.The third line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_j \\\\le 10^6$$$), where $$$b_j$$$ is the $$$j$$$-th element of $$$b$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum possible value of $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n} f(l, r)$$$ after rearranging elements of $$$b$$$, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.
