Double Sorttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.In one move, you can choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i, j \\\\le n$$$; $$$i \\\\neq j$$$) and swap $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_j$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ with $$$b_j$$$. You have to perform the swap in both arrays.You are allowed to perform at most $$$10^4$$$ moves (possibly, zero). Can you make both arrays sorted in a non-decreasing order at the end? If you can, print any sequence of moves that makes both arrays sorted.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of elements in both arrays.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$) — the first array.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le n$$$) — the second array.OutputFor each testcase, print the answer. If it's impossible to make both arrays sorted in a non-decreasing order in at most $$$10^4$$$ moves, print-1. Otherwise, first, print the number of moves $$$k$$$ $$$(0 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^4)$$$. Then print $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ for each move $$$(1 \\\\le i, j \\\\le n$$$; $$$i \\\\neq j)$$$.If there are multiple answers, then print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of moves.ExampleInput321 21 222 11 242 3 1 22 3 2 3Output0 -1 3 3 1 3 2 4 3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "195c908f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two arrays,  'a' and 'b', each with 'n' integers.
