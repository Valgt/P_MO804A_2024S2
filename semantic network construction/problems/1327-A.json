Sum of Odd Integerstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Your task is to find if $$$n$$$ can be represented as a sum of $$$k$$$distinct positive odd(not divisible by $$$2$$$) integers or not.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases.The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases. The only line of the test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, k \\\\le 10^7$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — \"YES\" (without quotes) if $$$n$$$ can be represented as a sum of $$$k$$$distinct positive odd(not divisible by $$$2$$$) integers and \"NO\" otherwise.ExampleInput6 3 1 4 2 10 3 10 2 16 4 16 5OutputYES YES NO YES YES NONoteIn the first test case, you can represent $$$3$$$ as $$$3$$$.In the second test case, the only way to represent $$$4$$$ is $$$1+3$$$.In the third test case, you cannot represent $$$10$$$ as the sum of three distinct positive odd integers.In the fourth test case, you can represent $$$10$$$ as $$$3+7$$$, for example.In the fifth test case, you can represent $$$16$$$ as $$$1+3+5+7$$$.In the sixth test case, you cannot represent $$$16$$$ as the sum of five distinct positive odd integers.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "46f0a060", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two numbers, $n$ and $k$.
