Count GCDtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ and an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. For each $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$ it holds that $$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le m$$$.Your task is to count the number of different arrays $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that:$$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le m$$$ for each $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$, and$$$\\\\gcd(b_1,b_2,b_3,...,b_i) = a_i$$$ for each $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$.Here $$$\\\\gcd(a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_i)$$$ denotes thegreatest common divisor (GCD)of integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_i$$$.Since this number can be too large, print it modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.InputEach test consist of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the maximum possible value of the element.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le m$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the number of different arrays satisfying the conditions above.
