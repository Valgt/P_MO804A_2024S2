Division + LCP (easy version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. In this version $$$l=r$$$.You are given a string $$$s$$$. For a fixed $$$k$$$, consider a division of $$$s$$$ into exactly $$$k$$$ continuous substrings $$$w_1,\\\\dots,w_k$$$. Let $$$f_k$$$ be the maximal possible $$$LCP(w_1,\\\\dots,w_k)$$$ among all divisions.$$$LCP(w_1,\\\\dots,w_m)$$$ is the length of the Longest Common Prefix of the strings $$$w_1,\\\\dots,w_m$$$.For example, if $$$s=abababcab$$$ and $$$k=4$$$, a possible division is $$$\\\\color{red}{ab}\\\\color{blue}{ab}\\\\color{orange}{abc}\\\\color{green}{ab}$$$. The $$$LCP(\\\\color{red}{ab},\\\\color{blue}{ab},\\\\color{orange}{abc},\\\\color{green}{ab})$$$ is $$$2$$$, since $$$ab$$$ is the Longest Common Prefix of those four strings. Note that each substring consists of a continuous segment of characters and each character belongs toexactlyone substring.Your task is to find $$$f_l,f_{l+1},\\\\dots,f_r$$$.In this version $$$l=r$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l = r \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string and the given range.The second line of each test case contains string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, all characters are lowercase English letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$r-l+1$$$ values: $$$f_l,\\\\dots,f_r$$$.ExampleInput73 3 3aba3 3 3aaa7 2 2abacaba9 4 4abababcab10 1 1codeforces9 3 3abafababa5 3 3zpozpOutput0 1 3 2 10 2 0NoteIn the first sample $$$n=k$$$, so the only division of $$$aba$$$ is $$$\\\\color{red}a\\\\color{blue}b\\\\color{orange}a$$$.
