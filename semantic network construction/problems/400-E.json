Inna and Binary Logictime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutInna is fed up with jokes about female logic. So she started using binary logic instead.Inna has an array ofnelementsa1[1],a1[2], ...,a1[n]. Girl likes to train in her binary logic, so she does an exercise consisting ofnstages: on the first stage Inna writes out all numbers from arraya1, on thei-th(i≥ 2)stage girl writes all elements of arrayai, which consists ofn-i+ 1integers; thek-th integer of arrayaiis defined as follows:ai[k] =ai- 1[k]ANDai- 1[k+ 1]. Here AND is bit-wise binary logical operation.Dima decided to check Inna's skill. He asks Inna to change array, perform the exercise and say the sum of allelements she wrote out during the current exercise.Help Inna to answer the questions!InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 105)— size of arraya1and number of Dima's questions. Next line containsnintegersa1[1],a1[2], ...,a1[n](0 ≤ai≤ 105)— initial array elements.Each of nextmlines contains two integers — Dima's question description. Each question consists of two integerspi,vi(1 ≤pi≤n; 0 ≤vi≤ 105). For this question Inna should makea1[pi]equalsvi, and then perform the exercise. Please, note that changes are saved from question to question.OutputFor each question print Inna's answer on a single line.ExamplesInput3 41 1 11 12 23 21 2Output64712", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a72ed36e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
