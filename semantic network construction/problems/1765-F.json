Chemistry Labtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp is planning on opening a chemistry lab. During the first month, he's going to distribute solutions of a certain acid.First, he will sign some contracts with a local chemistry factory. Each contract provides Monocarp with an unlimited supply of some solution of the same acid. The factory provides $$$n$$$ contract options, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th solution has a concentration of $$$x_i\\\\%$$$, the contract costs $$$w_i$$$ burles, and Monocarp will be able to sell it for $$$c_i$$$ burles per liter.Monocarp is expecting $$$k$$$ customers during the first month. Each customer will buy a liter of a $$$y\\\\%$$$-solution, where $$$y$$$ is arealnumber chosen uniformly at random from $$$0$$$ to $$$100$$$ independently for each customer. More formally, the probability of number $$$y$$$ being less than or equal to some $$$t$$$ is $$$P(y \\\\le t) = \\\\frac{t}{100}$$$.Monocarp can mix the solution that he signed the contracts with the factory for, at any ratio. More formally, if he has contracts for $$$m$$$ solutions with concentrations $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_m$$$, then, for these solutions, he picks their volumes $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_m$$$ so that $$$\\\\sum \\\\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = 1$$$ (exactly $$$1$$$ since each customer wants exactly one liter of a certain solution).The concentration of the resulting solution is $$$\\\\sum \\\\limits_{i=1}^{m} x_i \\\\cdot a_i$$$. The price of the resulting solution is $$$\\\\sum \\\\limits_{i=1}^{m} c_i \\\\cdot a_i$$$.If Monocarp can obtain a solution of concentration $$$y\\\\%$$$, then he will do it while maximizing its price (the cost for the customer). Otherwise, the customer leaves without buying anything, and the price is considered equal to $$$0$$$.Monocarp wants to sign some contracts with a factory (possibly, none or all of them) so that the expected profit is maximized — the expected total price of the sold solutions for all $$$k$$$ customers minus the total cost of signing the contracts from the factory.Print the maximum expected profit Monocarp can achieve.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5000$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of contracts the factory provides and the number of customers.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$x_i, w_i$$$ and $$$c_i$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le x_i \\\\le 100$$$; $$$1 \\\\le w_i \\\\le 10^9$$$; $$$1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the concentration of the solution, the cost of the contract and the cost per liter for the customer, for the $$$i$$$-th contract.OutputPrint a single real number — the maximum expected profit Monocarp can achieve.Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\\\\frac{|a - b|}{\\\\max{(1, |b|)}} \\\\le 10^{-6}$$$.ExamplesInput2 10 0 10 20 100 15 20Output175.000000000000000Input2 10 0 100 20 100 150 20Output0.000000000000000Input6 15 79 5 35 30 13 132 37 3 52 24 2 60 76 18 14 71 17 7Output680.125000000000000Input10 15 46 11 11 4 12 170 69 2 130 2 8 72 82 7 117 100 5 154 38 9 146 97 1 132 0 12 82 53 1 144Output2379.400000000000000", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "12852364", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ types of acid solutions available.
