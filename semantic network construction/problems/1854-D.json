Michael and Hoteltime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMichael and Brian are stuck in a hotel with $$$n$$$ rooms, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and need to find each other. But this hotel's doors are all locked and the only way of getting around is by using the teleporters in each room. Room $$$i$$$ has a teleporter that will take you to room $$$a_i$$$ (it might be that $$$a_i = i$$$). But they don't know the values of $$$a_1,a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$.Instead, they can call up the front desk to ask queries. In one query, they give a room $$$u$$$, a positive integer $$$k$$$, and a set of rooms $$$S$$$. The hotel concierge answers whether a person starting in room $$$u$$$, and using the teleporters $$$k$$$ times, ends up in a room in $$$S$$$.Brian is in room $$$1$$$. Michael wants to know the set $$$A$$$ of rooms so that if he starts in one of those rooms they can use the teleporters to meet up. He can ask at most $$$2000$$$ queries.The values $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ are fixed before the start of the interaction and do not depend on your queries. In other words, the interactor is not adaptive.InputThe input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 500$$$).InteractionTo ask a query, print a line in the format \"? u k |S| S_1 S_2 ... S_|S|\" with $$$1 \\\\leq u, S_1, \\\\ldots, S_{|S|} \\\\leq n$$$, all the $$$S_i$$$ distinct, and $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 10^9$$$.As a response to the query you will get \"1\" if the answer is yes, and \"0\" if the answer is no.To output an answer, you should print \"! |A| A_1 A_2 ... A_|A|\" with $$$1 \\\\leq A_1, \\\\ldots, A_{|A|} \\\\leq n$$$ all distinct. Printing the answer doesn't count as a query.See the interaction example for more clarity.If you ask too many queries or you ask a malformed query, you will getWrong answer.After printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will getIdleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:fflush(stdout)orcout.flush()in C++;System.out.flush()in Java;flush(output)in Pascal;stdout.flush()in Python;see the documentation for other languages.Hack formatFor the hacks use the following format.The first line should contain $$$n$$$ — the number of rooms.The second line should contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ — the teleporter in room $$$i$$$ leads to room $$$a_i$$$.ExampleInput5  0  1Output? 3 5 2 2 3  ? 2 5 2 2 3  ! 3 1 3 4NoteIn the sample test, there are $$$n=5$$$ rooms and the (hidden) array describing the behavior of the teleporters is $$$[1, 2, 1, 3, 2]$$$.The first query asks whether starting from room number $$$a=3$$$, and using the teleporters $$$5$$$ times, one ends up in one of the two rooms $$$S=\\\\{2, 3\\\\}$$$. This action results in ending up in the room $$$1$$$, so the answer is $$$0$$$.The second query asks whether starting from room number $$$a=2$$$, and using the teleporters $$$5$$$ times, one ends up in one of the two rooms $$$S=\\\\{2, 3\\\\}$$$. This action results in ending up in the room $$$2$$$, so the answer is $$$1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d6c6d5ec", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ rooms numbered from 1 to $n$.
