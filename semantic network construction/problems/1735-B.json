Tea with Tangerinestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ pieces of tangerine peel, the $$$i$$$-th of them has size $$$a_i$$$. In one step it is possible to divide one piece of size $$$x$$$ into two pieces of positive integer sizes $$$y$$$ and $$$z$$$ so that $$$y + z = x$$$.You want that for each pair of pieces, their sizes differstrictlyless than twice. In other words, there should not be two pieces of size $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, such that $$$2x \\\\le y$$$. What is the minimum possible number of steps needed to satisfy the condition?InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$).Then one line follows, containing $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1 \\\\le a_2 \\\\le \\\\ldots \\\\le a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^7$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of steps.ExampleInput351 2 3 4 5110335600 900 1300 2000 2550Output10 0 4NoteIn the first test case, we initially have a piece of size $$$1$$$, so all final pieces must have size $$$1$$$. The total number of steps is: $$$0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$$$.In the second test case, we have just one piece, so we don't need to do anything, and the answer is $$$0$$$ steps.In the third test case, one of the possible cut options is: $$$600,\\\\ 900,\\\\ (600 | 700),\\\\ (1000 | 1000),\\\\ (1000 | 1000 | 550)$$$. You can see this option in the picture below. The maximum piece has size $$$1000$$$, and it is less than $$$2$$$ times bigger than the minimum piece of size $$$550$$$. $$$4$$$ steps are done. We can show that it is the minimum possible number of steps.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "05f5f1a8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ pieces of tangerine peel, each with a size $a_i$.
