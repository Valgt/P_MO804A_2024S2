Line Triptime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a road, which can be represented as a number line. You are located in the point $$$0$$$ of the number line, and you want to travel from the point $$$0$$$ to the point $$$x$$$, and back to the point $$$0$$$.You travel by car, which spends $$$1$$$ liter of gasoline per $$$1$$$ unit of distance travelled. When you start at the point $$$0$$$, your car is fully fueled (its gas tank contains the maximum possible amount of fuel).There are $$$n$$$ gas stations, located in points $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$. When you arrive at a gas station, you fully refuel your car.Note that you can refuel only at gas stations, and there are no gas stations in points $$$0$$$ and $$$x$$$.You have to calculate the minimum possible volume of the gas tank in your car (in liters) that will allow you to travel from the point $$$0$$$ to the point $$$x$$$ and back to the point $$$0$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines:the first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$; $$$2 \\\\le x \\\\le 100$$$);the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 < a_1 < a_2 < \\\\dots < a_n < x$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum possible volume of the gas tank in your car that will allow you to travel from the point $$$0$$$ to the point $$$x$$$ and back.ExampleInput33 71 2 53 61 2 51 107Output4 3 7NoteIn the first test case of the example, if the car has a gas tank of $$$4$$$ liters, you can travel to $$$x$$$ and back as follows:travel to the point $$$1$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$3$$$ liters of fuel;refuel at the point $$$1$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$4$$$ liters of fuel;travel to the point $$$2$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$3$$$ liters of fuel;refuel at the point $$$2$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$4$$$ liters of fuel;travel to the point $$$5$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$1$$$ liter of fuel;refuel at the point $$$5$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$4$$$ liters of fuel;travel to the point $$$7$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$2$$$ liters of fuel;travel to the point $$$5$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$0$$$ liters of fuel;refuel at the point $$$5$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$4$$$ liters of fuel;travel to the point $$$2$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$1$$$ liter of fuel;refuel at the point $$$2$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$4$$$ liters of fuel;travel to the point $$$1$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$3$$$ liters of fuel;refuel at the point $$$1$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$4$$$ liters of fuel;travel to the point $$$0$$$, then your car's gas tank contains $$$3$$$ liters of fuel.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9c3e4f0d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have a road represented as a number line.
