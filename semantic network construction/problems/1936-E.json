Yet Yet Another Permutation Problemtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$.Please count the number of permutations $$$q$$$ of length $$$n$$$ which satisfy the following:for each $$$1 \\\\le i < n$$$, $$$\\\\max(q_1,\\\\ldots,q_i) \\\\neq \\\\max(p_1,\\\\ldots,p_i)$$$.Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$).

The only suitable $$$q$$$ is $$$[1, 2]$$$. Indeed, we need to satisfy the inequality $$$q_1 \\\\neq p_1$$$. It only holds for $$$q = [1, 2]$$$.In the second test case, $$$p = [1, 2, 3]$$$. So $$$q$$$ has to satisfy two inequalities: $$$q_1 \\\\neq p_1$$$ and $$$\\\\max(q_1, q_2) \\\\neq \\\\max(1, 2) = 2$$$. One can prove that this only holds for the following $$$3$$$ permutations:$$$q = [2, 3, 1]$$$: in this case $$$q_1 = 2 \\\\neq 1$$$ and $$$\\\\max(q_1, q_2) = 3 \\\\neq 2$$$;$$$q = [3, 1, 2]$$$: in this case $$$q_1 = 3 \\\\neq 1$$$ and $$$\\\\max(q_1, q_2) = 3 \\\\neq 2$$$;$$$q = [3, 2, 1]$$$: in this case $$$q_1 = 3 \\\\neq 1$$$ and $$$\\\\max(q_1, q_2) = 3 \\\\neq 2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "be1d77ab", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a permutation $p$ of length $n$.
