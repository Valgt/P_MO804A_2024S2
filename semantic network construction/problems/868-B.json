Race Against Timetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputHave you ever tried to explain to the coordinator, why it is eight hours to the contest and not a single problem has been prepared yet? Misha had. And this time he has areallystrong excuse: he faced a space-time paradox! Space and time replaced each other.The entire universe turned into an enormous clock face with three hands — hour, minute, and second. Time froze, and clocks now show the timehhours,mminutes,sseconds.Last time Misha talked with the coordinator att1o'clock, so now he stands on the numbert1on the clock face. The contest should be ready byt2o'clock. In the terms of paradox it means that Misha has to go to numbert2somehow. Note that he doesn't have to move forward only: in these circumstances time has no direction.Clock hands are very long, and Misha cannot get round them. He also cannot step over as it leads to the collapse of space-time. That is, if hour clock points 12 and Misha stands at 11 then he cannot move to 1 along the top arc. He has to follow all the way round the clock center (of course, if there are no other hands on his way).Given the hands' positions,t1, andt2, find if Misha can prepare the contest on time (or should we sayon space?). That is, find if he can move fromt1tot2by the clock face.InputFive integersh,m,s,t1,t2(1 ≤h≤ 12,0 ≤m,s≤ 59,1 ≤t1,t2≤ 12,t1≠t2).Misha's position and the target time do not coincide with the position of any hand.OutputPrint \"YES\" (quotes for clarity), if Misha can prepare the contest on time, and \"NO\" otherwise.You can print each character either upper- or lowercase (\"YeS\" and \"yes\" are valid when the answer is \"YES\").ExamplesInput12 30 45 3 11OutputNOInput12 0 1 12 1OutputYESInput3 47 0 4 9OutputYESNoteThe three examples are shown on the pictures below from left to right. The starting position of Misha is shown with green, the ending position is shown with pink. Note that the positions of the hands on the pictures are not exact, but are close to the exact and the answer is the same.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "df8991e9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a clock face with hour, minute, and second hands.
