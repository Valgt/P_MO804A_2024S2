Sequence of Comparisonstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOnce upon a time, Petya had an array of integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. But over time, the array itself was lost, and only $$$n-1$$$ results of comparisons of neighboring array elements remained. In other words, for every $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$, Petya knows exactly one of these three facts:$$$a_i < a_{i+1}$$$;$$$a_i = a_{i+1}$$$;$$$a_i > a_{i+1}$$$.Petya wonders if it is possible to uniquely determine the result of comparing $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_n$$$.You have to help Petya determine the result of comparing $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_n$$$ or report that the result cannot be determined unambiguously.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of the test case contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 100$$$), where $$$s_i$$$ is:<, if $$$a_i < a_{i + 1}$$$;>, if $$$a_i > a_{i + 1}$$$;=, if $$$a_i = a_{i + 1}$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single string equal to:<, if $$$a_1 < a_n$$$;>, if $$$a_1 > a_n$$$;=, if $$$a_1 = a_n$$$;?, if it is impossible to uniquely determine the result of the comparison.ExampleInput4 >>> <><=< = <<==Output> ? = <NoteConsider the test cases of the example:in the first test case, it's easy to see that $$$a_1 > a_4$$$ since $$$a_1 > a_2 > a_3 > a_4$$$;in the second test case, both sequences $$$[1, 2, 0, 10, 10, 15]$$$ and $$$[10, 11, 1, 2, 2, 5]$$$ meet the constraints; in the first one, $$$a_1 < a_6$$$, and in the second one, $$$a_1 > a_6$$$, so it's impossible to compare $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_6$$$;in the third test case, we already know that $$$a_1 = a_2$$$;in the fourth test case, it's easy to see that $$$a_3 = a_4 = a_5$$$, and $$$a_1 < a_2 < a_3$$$, so $$$a_1 < a_5$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ed19f01e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string  $s$ of length $n-1$ where each character is either '<', '>', or '='.
