Subset Mextime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven a set of integers (it can contain equal elements).You have to split it into two subsets $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ (both of them can contain equal elements or be empty). You have to maximize the value of $$$mex(A)+mex(B)$$$.Here $$$mex$$$ of a set denotes the smallest non-negative integer that doesn't exist in the set. For example:$$$mex(\\\\{1,4,0,2,2,1\\\\})=3$$$$$$mex(\\\\{3,3,2,1,3,0,0\\\\})=4$$$$$$mex(\\\\varnothing)=0$$$ ($$$mex$$$ for empty set)The set is splitted into two subsets $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ if for any integer number $$$x$$$ the number of occurrences of $$$x$$$ into this set is equal to the sum of the number of occurrences of $$$x$$$ into $$$A$$$ and the number of occurrences of $$$x$$$ into $$$B$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t\\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq 100$$$) — the size of the set.The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\dots a_n$$$ ($$$0\\\\leq a_i\\\\leq 100$$$) — the numbers in the set.OutputFor each test case, print the maximum value of $$$mex(A)+mex(B)$$$.ExampleInput4 6 0 2 1 5 0 1 3 0 1 2 4 0 2 0 1 6 1 2 3 4 5 6Output5 3 4 0NoteIn the first test case, $$$A=\\\\left\\\\{0,1,2\\\\right\\\\},B=\\\\left\\\\{0,1,5\\\\right\\\\}$$$ is a possible choice.In the second test case, $$$A=\\\\left\\\\{0,1,2\\\\right\\\\},B=\\\\varnothing$$$ is a possible choice.In the third test case, $$$A=\\\\left\\\\{0,1,2\\\\right\\\\},B=\\\\left\\\\{0\\\\right\\\\}$$$ is a possible choice.In the fourth test case, $$$A=\\\\left\\\\{1,3,5\\\\right\\\\},B=\\\\left\\\\{2,4,6\\\\right\\\\}$$$ is a possible choice.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e7f1bff6", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of integers.
