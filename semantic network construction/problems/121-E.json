Lucky Arraytime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutPetya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits4and7. For example, numbers47,744,4are lucky and5,17,467are not.Petya has an array consisting ofnnumbers. He wants to performmoperations of two types:addlrd— add an integerdto all elements whose indexes belong to the interval fromltor, inclusive(1 ≤l≤r≤n, 1 ≤d≤ 104);countlr— find and print on the screen how many lucky numbers there are among elements with indexes that belong to the interval fromltorinclusive(1 ≤l≤r≤n). Each lucky number should be counted as many times as it appears in the interval.Petya has a list of all operations. The operations are such that after all additions the array won't have numbers that would exceed104. Help Petya write a program that would perform these operations.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 105) — the number of numbers in the array and the number of operations correspondingly. The second line containsnpositive integers, none of which exceeds104— those are the array numbers. Nextmlines contain operations, one per line. They correspond to the description given in the statement.It is guaranteed that after all operations are fulfilled each number in the array will not exceed104.OutputFor each operation of the second type print the single number on the single line — the number of lucky numbers in the corresponding interval.ExamplesInput3 62 3 4count 1 3count 1 2add 1 3 2count 1 3add 2 3 3count 1 3Output1011Input4 54 4 4 4count 1 4add 1 4 3count 1 4add 2 3 40count 1 4Output444NoteIn the first sample after the first addition the array will look in the following manner:4 5 6After the second addition:4 8 9The second sample after the first addition:7 7 7 7After the second addition:7 47 47 7", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "190ea21b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
