Dictionarytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe Berland language consists of words havingexactly two letters. Moreover,the first letter of a word is different from the second letter. Any combination of two different Berland letters (which, by the way, are the same as the lowercase letters of Latin alphabet) is a correct word in Berland language.The Berland dictionary contains all words of this language. The words are listed in a way they are usually ordered in dictionaries. Formally, word $$$a$$$ comes earlier than word $$$b$$$ in the dictionary if one of the following conditions hold:the first letter of $$$a$$$ is less than the first letter of $$$b$$$;the first letters of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are the same, and the second letter of $$$a$$$ is less than the second letter of $$$b$$$.So, the dictionary looks like that:Word $$$1$$$:abWord $$$2$$$:ac...Word $$$25$$$:azWord $$$26$$$:baWord $$$27$$$:bc...Word $$$649$$$:zxWord $$$650$$$:zyYou are given a word $$$s$$$ from the Berland language. Your task is to find its index in the dictionary.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 650$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing $$$s$$$ — a string consisting ofexactly two different lowercase Latin letters(i. e. a correct word of the Berland language).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the index of the word $$$s$$$ in the dictionary.ExampleInput7abacazbabczxzyOutput1 2 25 26 27 649 650", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9a6c54e5", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a two-letter word.
