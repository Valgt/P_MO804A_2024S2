Mister B and PR Shiftstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSome time ago Mister B detected a strange signal from the space, which he started to study.After some transformation the signal turned out to be a permutationpof lengthnor its cyclic shift. For the further investigation Mister B need some basis, that's why he decided to choose cyclic shift of this permutation which has the minimum possible deviation.Let's define the deviation of a permutationpas.Find a cyclic shift of permutationpwith minimum possible deviation. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.Let's denote idk(0 ≤k<n) of a cyclic shift of permutationpas the number of right shifts needed to reach this shift, for example:k= 0: shiftp1,p2, ...pn,k= 1: shiftpn,p1, ...pn- 1,...,k=n- 1: shiftp2,p3, ...pn,p1.InputFirst line contains single integern(2 ≤n≤ 106) — the length of the permutation.The second line containsnspace-separated integersp1,p2, ...,pn(1 ≤pi≤n) — the elements of the permutation.
