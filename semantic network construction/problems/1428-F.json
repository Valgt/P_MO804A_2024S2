Fruit Sequencestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputZookeeper is buying a carton of fruit to feed his pet wabbit. The fruits are a sequence of apples and oranges, which is represented by a binary string $$$s_1s_2\\\\ldots s_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. $$$1$$$ represents an apple and $$$0$$$ represents an orange.Since wabbit is allergic to eating oranges, Zookeeper would like to find the longestcontiguoussequence of apples.
