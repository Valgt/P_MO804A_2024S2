Alyona and mextime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlyona's mother wants to present an array ofnnon-negative integers to Alyona. The array should be special.Alyona is a capricious girl so after she gets the array, she inspectsmof its subarrays. Subarray is a set of some subsequent elements of the array. Thei-th subarray is described with two integersliandri, and its elements area[li],a[li+ 1], ...,a[ri].Alyona is going to findmexfor each of the chosen subarrays. Among thesemmexesthe girl is going to find the smallest. She wants this minimummexto be as large as possible.You are to find an arrayaofnelements so that the minimummexamong those chosen by Alyona subarrays is as large as possible.Themexof a setSis a minimum possible non-negative integer that is not inS.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 105).The nextmlines contain information about the subarrays chosen by Alyona. Thei-th of these lines contains two integersliandri(1 ≤li≤ri≤n), that describe the subarraya[li],a[li+ 1], ...,a[ri].OutputIn the first line print single integer — the maximum possible minimummex.In the second line printnintegers — the arraya. All the elements inashould be between0and109.It is guaranteed that there is an optimal answer in which all the elements inaare between0and109.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput5 31 32 54 5Output21 0 2 1 0Input4 21 42 4Output35 2 0 1NoteThe first example: themexof the subarray(1, 3)is equal to3, themexof the subarray(2, 5)is equal to3, themexof the subarray(4, 5)is equal to2as well, thus the minumalmexamong the subarrays chosen by Alyona is equal to2.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "093cc68d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers $n$ and $m$.
