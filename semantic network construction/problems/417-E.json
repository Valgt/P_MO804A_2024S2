Square Tabletime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutWhile resting on the ship after the \"Russian Code Cup\" a boy named Misha invented an interesting game. He promised to give his quadrocopter to whoever will be the first one to make a rectangular table of sizen×m, consisting of positive integers such that the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column was also a square.Since checking the correctness of the table manually is difficult, Misha asks you to make each number in the table to not exceed108.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 100)  — the size of the table.OutputPrint the table that meets the condition:nlines containingmintegers, separated by spaces.
