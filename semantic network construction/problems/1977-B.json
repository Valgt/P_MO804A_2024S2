Binary Colouringtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a positive integer $$$x$$$. Find any array of integers $$$a_0, a_1, \\\\ldots, a_{n-1}$$$ for which the following holds:$$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 32$$$,$$$a_i$$$ is $$$1$$$, $$$0$$$, or $$$-1$$$ for all $$$0 \\\\le i \\\\le n - 1$$$,$$$x = \\\\displaystyle{\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \\\\cdot 2^i}}$$$,There does not exist an index $$$0 \\\\le i \\\\le n - 2$$$ such that both $$$a_{i} \\\\neq 0$$$ and $$$a_{i + 1} \\\\neq 0$$$.It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array always exists.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x < 2^{30}$$$).OutputFor each test case, output two lines.On the first line, output an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 32$$$) — the length of the array $$$a_0, a_1, \\\\ldots, a_{n-1}$$$.On the second line, output the array $$$a_0, a_1, \\\\ldots, a_{n-1}$$$.If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.ExampleInput71142415271119Output1 1 5 0 -1 0 0 1 6 0 0 0 -1 0 1 5 -1 0 0 0 1 6 -1 0 -1 0 0 1 5 -1 0 -1 0 1 5 -1 0 1 0 1NoteIn the first test case, one valid array is $$$[1]$$$, since $$$(1) \\\\cdot 2^0 = 1$$$.In the second test case, one possible valid array is $$$[0,-1,0,0,1]$$$, since $$$(0) \\\\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \\\\cdot 2^1 + (0) \\\\cdot 2^2 + (0) \\\\cdot 2^3 + (1) \\\\cdot 2^4 = -2 + 16 = 14$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e22e7d3c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a positive integer $x$.
