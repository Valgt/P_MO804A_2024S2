Fire Againtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test64 megabytesinputinput.txtoutputoutput.txtAfter a terrifying forest fire in Berland a forest rebirth program was carried out. Due to itNrows withMtrees each were planted and the rows were so neat that one could map it on a system of coordinates so that thej-th tree in thei-th row would have the coordinates of(i,j). However a terrible thing happened and the young forest caught fire. Now we must find the coordinates of the tree that will catch fire last to plan evacuation.The burning began inKpoints simultaneously, which means that initiallyKtrees started to burn. Every minute the fire gets from the burning trees to the ones that aren’t burning and that the distance from them to the nearest burning tree equals to 1.Find the tree that will be the last to start burning. If there are several such trees, output any.InputThe first input line contains two integersN,M(1 ≤N,M≤ 2000) — the size of the forest. The trees were planted in all points of the (x,y) (1 ≤x≤N, 1 ≤y≤M) type,xandyare integers.The second line contains an integerK(1 ≤K≤ 10) — amount of trees, burning in the beginning.The third line containsKpairs of integers:x1,y1,x2,y2, ...,xk,yk(1 ≤xi≤N, 1 ≤yi≤M) — coordinates of the points from which the fire started. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide.OutputOutput a line with two space-separated integersxandy— coordinates of the tree that will be the last one to start burning.
