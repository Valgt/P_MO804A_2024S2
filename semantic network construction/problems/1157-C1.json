Increasing Subsequence (easy version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe only difference between problems C1 and C2 is that all values in input of problem C1 are distinct (this condition may be false for problem C2).You are given a sequence $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.All these integers are distinct, each value from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears in the sequence exactly once.You are making a sequence of moves. During each move you must take either the leftmost element of the sequence or the rightmost element of the sequence, write it down and remove it from the sequence. Your task is to write down astrictlyincreasing sequence, and among all such sequences you should take the longest (the length of the sequence is the number of elements in it).For example, for the sequence $$$[2, 1, 5, 4, 3]$$$ the answer is $$$4$$$ (you take $$$2$$$ and the sequence becomes $$$[1, 5, 4, 3]$$$, then you take the rightmost element $$$3$$$ and the sequence becomes $$$[1, 5, 4]$$$, then you take $$$4$$$ and the sequence becomes $$$[1, 5]$$$ and then you take $$$5$$$ and the sequence becomes $$$[1]$$$, the obtained increasing sequence is $$$[2, 3, 4, 5]$$$).InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.All these integers are pairwise distinct.OutputIn the first line of the output print $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of elements in astrictlyincreasing sequence you can obtain.In the second line print a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$k$$$, where the $$$j$$$-th character of this string $$$s_j$$$ should be 'L' if you take the leftmost element during the $$$j$$$-th move and 'R' otherwise. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.ExamplesInput5 2 1 5 4 3Output4 LRRRInput7 1 3 5 6 7 4 2Output7 LRLRLLLInput3 1 2 3Output3 LLLInput4 1 2 4 3Output4 LLRLNoteThe first example is described in the problem statement.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8a4bcc73", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ distinct integers from 1 to $n$.
