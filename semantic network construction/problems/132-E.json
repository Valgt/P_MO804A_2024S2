New values of variables are defined in a rather lengthy way, so a programmer should try to minimize their usage.You have to print the given sequence ofnintegers. To do this, you havemvariables and two types of operations on them:variable=integerprint(variable)Any of themvariables can be used asvariable. Variables are denoted by lowercase letters between \"a\" and \"z\", inclusive. Any integer number can be used asinteger.Let's say that the penalty for using first type of operations equals to the number of set bits in the numberinteger. There is no penalty on using second type of operations. Find and output the program which minimizes the penalty for printing the given sequence of numbers.InputThe first line of input contains integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 250,1 ≤m≤ 26). The second line contains the sequence to be printed. Each element of the sequence is an integer between1and109, inclusive. The sequence has to be printed in the given order (from left to right).OutputOutput the number of lines in the optimal program and the optimal penalty. Next, output the program itself, one command per line. If there are several programs with minimal penalty, output any of them (you have only to minimize the penalty).ExamplesInput7 21 2 2 4 2 1 2Output11 4b=1print(b)a=2print(a)print(a)b=4print(b)print(a)b=1print(b)print(a)Input6 31 2 3 1 2 3Output9 4c=1print(c)b=2print(b)a=3print(a)print(c)print(b)print(a)", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0c6ab997", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ integers.
