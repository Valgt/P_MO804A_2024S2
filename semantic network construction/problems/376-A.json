Levertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYou have a description of a lever as strings. We'll represent the string length as record|s|, then the lever looks as a horizontal bar with weights of length|s| - 1with exactly one pivot. We will assume that the bar is a segment on theOxaxis between points0and|s| - 1.The decoding of the lever description is given below.If thei-th character of the string equals \"^\", that means that at coordinateithere is the pivot under the bar.If thei-th character of the string equals \"=\", that means that at coordinateithere is nothing lying on the bar.If thei-th character of the string equals digitc(1-9), that means that at coordinateithere is a weight of masscon the bar.Your task is, given the lever description, print if it will be in balance or not. Assume that the bar doesn't weight anything. Assume that the bar initially is in balance then all weights are simultaneously put on it. After that the bar either tilts to the left, or tilts to the right, or is in balance.InputThe first line contains the lever description as a non-empty strings(3 ≤ |s| ≤ 106), consisting of digits (1-9) and characters \"^\" and \"=\". It is guaranteed that the line contains exactly one character \"^\". It is guaranteed that the pivot of the lever isn't located in any end of the lever bar.To solve the problem you may need 64-bit integer numbers. Please, do not forget to use them in your programs.OutputPrint \"left\" if the given lever tilts to the left, \"right\" if it tilts to the right and \"balance\", if it is in balance.ExamplesInput=^==OutputbalanceInput9===^==1OutputleftInput2==^7==OutputrightInput41^52==OutputbalanceNoteAs you solve the problem, you may find the following link useful to better understand how a lever functions:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever.The pictures to the examples:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8274ed19", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string representing a lever.
