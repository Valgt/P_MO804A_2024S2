Polycarp and the Day of Pitime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOn March 14, the day of the number $$$\\\\pi$$$ is celebrated all over the world. This is a very important mathematical constant equal to the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.Polycarp was told at school that the number $$$\\\\pi$$$ is irrational, therefore it has an infinite number of digits in decimal notation. He wanted to prepare for the Day of the number $$$\\\\pi$$$ by memorizing this number as accurately as possible.Polycarp wrote out all the digits that he managed to remember. For example, if Polycarp remembered $$$\\\\pi$$$ as $$$3.1415$$$, he wrote out31415.Polycarp was in a hurry and could have made a mistake, so you decided to check how many first digits of the number $$$\\\\pi$$$ Polycarp actually remembers correctly.InputThe first line of the input data contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases in the test.Each test case is described by a single string of digits $$$n$$$, which was written out by Polycarp.The string $$$n$$$ contains up to $$$30$$$ digits.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ integers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case, that is how many first digits of the number $$$\\\\pi$$$ Polycarp remembers correctly.ExampleInput900034141592653141592653589793238462643383279314203141531415926535827182314159265358979323846264338327Output0 1 0 0 3 5 12 0 30", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "34440361", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a number of test cases.
