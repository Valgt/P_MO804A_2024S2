Points on the linetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWe've got no test cases. A big olympiad is coming up. But the problemsetters' number one priority should be adding another problem to the round.Thediameterof a multiset of points on the line is the largest distance between two points from this set. For example, the diameter of the multiset{1, 3, 2, 1}is 2.Diameter of multiset consisting of one point is 0.You are givennpoints on the line. What is the minimum number of points you have to remove, so that the diameter of the multiset of the remaining points will not exceedd?InputThe first line contains two integersnandd(1 ≤n≤ 100, 0 ≤d≤ 100) — the amount of points and the maximum allowed diameter respectively.The second line containsnspace separated integers (1 ≤xi≤ 100) — the coordinates of the points.OutputOutput a single integer — the minimum number of points you have to remove.ExamplesInput3 12 1 4Output1Input3 07 7 7Output0Input6 31 3 4 6 9 10Output3NoteIn the first test case the optimal strategy is to remove the point with coordinate4. The remaining points will have coordinates1and2, so the diameter will be equal to2 - 1 = 1.In the second test case the diameter is equal to0, so its is unnecessary to remove any points.In the third test case the optimal strategy is to remove points with coordinates1,9and10. The remaining points will have coordinates3,4and6, so the diameter will be equal to6 - 3 = 3.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2f83c6cf", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ points on a line.
