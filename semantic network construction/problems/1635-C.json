The first line will contain a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10000)$$$ — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(3 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5)$$$ — the size of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots ,a_n$$$ $$$(-10^9 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9)$$$, the elements of $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$-1$$$ in a single line if there is no solution.
