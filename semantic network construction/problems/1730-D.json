Prefixes and Suffixestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have two strings $$$s_1$$$ and $$$s_2$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters. You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:Choose a positive integer $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n$$$.Swap the prefix of the string $$$s_1$$$ and the suffix of the string $$$s_2$$$ of length $$$k$$$.Is it possible to make these two strings equal by doing described operations?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.Each test case consists of three lines.The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the strings $$$s_1$$$ and $$$s_2$$$.The second line contains the string $$$s_1$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters.The third line contains the string $$$s_2$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to make the strings equal, and \"NO\" otherwise.ExampleInput73cbcaba5abcaacbabb5abcaacbabz1aa1ab6abadaaadaaba8abcabdaaadabcabaOutputYES YES NO YES NO NO YESNoteIn the first test case:Initially $$$s_1 = \\\\mathtt{cbc}$$$, $$$s_2 = \\\\mathtt{aba}$$$.Operation with $$$k = 1$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \\\\mathtt{abc}$$$, $$$s_2 = \\\\mathtt{abc}$$$.In the second test case:Initially $$$s_1 = \\\\mathtt{abcaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \\\\mathtt{cbabb}$$$.Operation with $$$k = 2$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \\\\mathtt{bbcaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \\\\mathtt{cbaab}$$$.Operation with $$$k = 3$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \\\\mathtt{aabaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \\\\mathtt{cbbbc}$$$.Operation with $$$k = 1$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \\\\mathtt{cabaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \\\\mathtt{cbbba}$$$.Operation with $$$k = 2$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \\\\mathtt{babaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \\\\mathtt{cbbca}$$$.Operation with $$$k = 1$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \\\\mathtt{aabaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \\\\mathtt{cbbcb}$$$.Operation with $$$k = 2$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \\\\mathtt{cbbaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \\\\mathtt{cbbaa}$$$.In the third test case, it's impossible to make strings equal.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d7a55f64", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two strings,  $s_1$ and $s_2$, both of length $n$.
