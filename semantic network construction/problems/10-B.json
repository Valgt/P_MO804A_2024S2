Cinema Cashiertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutAll cinema halls in Berland are rectangles withKrows ofKseats each, andKis an odd number. Rows and seats are numbered from1toK. For safety reasons people, who come to the box office to buy tickets, are not allowed to choose seats themselves. Formerly the choice was made by a cashier, but now this is the responsibility of a special seating program. It was found out that the large majority of Berland's inhabitants go to the cinema in order to watch a movie, that's why they want to sit as close to the hall center as possible. Moreover, a company ofMpeople, who come to watch a movie, want necessarily to occupyMsuccessive seats in one row. Let's formulate the algorithm, according to which the program chooses seats and sells tickets. As the request forMseats comes, the program should determine the row numberxand the segment[yl,yr]of the seats numbers in this row, whereyr-yl+ 1 =M. From all such possible variants as a final result the program should choose the one with the minimum function value of total seats remoteness from the center. Say,— the row and the seat numbers of the most \"central\" seat. Then the function value of seats remoteness from the hall center is. If the amount of minimum function values is more than one, the program should choose the one that is closer to the screen (i.e. the row numberxis lower). If the variants are still multiple, it should choose the one with the minimumyl. If you did not get yet, your task is to simulate the work of this program.InputThe first line contains two integersNandK(1 ≤N≤ 1000, 1 ≤K≤ 99) — the amount of requests and the hall size respectively.
