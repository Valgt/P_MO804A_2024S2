Palindromic Pathstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problemYou are given a grid $$$n\\\\times n$$$, where $$$n$$$ isodd. Rows are enumerated from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from up to down, columns are enumerated from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. Cell, standing on the intersection of row $$$x$$$ and column $$$y$$$, is denoted by $$$(x, y)$$$.Every cell contains $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. It is known that the top-left cell contains $$$1$$$, and the bottom-right cell contains $$$0$$$.We want to know numbers in all cells of the grid. To do so we can ask the following questions:\"$$$?$$$ $$$x_1$$$ $$$y_1$$$ $$$x_2$$$ $$$y_2$$$\", where $$$1 \\\\le x_1 \\\\le x_2 \\\\le n$$$, $$$1 \\\\le y_1 \\\\le y_2 \\\\le n$$$, and $$$x_1 + y_1 + 2 \\\\le x_2 + y_2$$$. In other words, we output two different cells $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$, $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ of the grid such that we can get from the first to the second by moving only to the right and down, and they aren't adjacent.As a response to such question you will be told if there exists a path between $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$, going only to the right or down, numbers in cells of which form a palindrome.For example, paths, shown in green, are palindromic, so answer for \"$$$?$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$2$$$ $$$3$$$\" and \"$$$?$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$2$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$3$$$\" would be that there exists such path. However, there is no palindromic path between $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(3, 1)$$$.Determine all cells of the grid by asking not more than $$$n^2$$$ questions. It can be shown that the answer always exists.InputThe first line containsoddinteger ($$$3 \\\\le n < 50$$$) — the side of the grid.InteractionYou begin the interaction by reading $$$n$$$.To ask a question about cells $$$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$$$, in a separate line output \"$$$?$$$ $$$x_1$$$ $$$y_1$$$ $$$x_2$$$ $$$y_2$$$\".Numbers in the query have to satisfy $$$1 \\\\le x_1 \\\\le x_2 \\\\le n$$$, $$$1 \\\\le y_1 \\\\le y_2 \\\\le n$$$, and $$$x_1 + y_1 + 2 \\\\le x_2 + y_2$$$. Don't forget to 'flush', to get the answer.In response, you will receive $$$1$$$, if there exists a path going from $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ to $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ only to the right or down, numbers in cells of which form a palindrome, and $$$0$$$ otherwise.In case your query is invalid or you asked more than $$$n^2$$$ queries, program will print $$$-1$$$ and will finish interaction. You will receiveWrong answerverdict. Make sure to exit immediately to avoid getting other verdicts.When you determine numbers in all cells, output \"!\".Then output $$$n$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which is a string of length $$$n$$$, corresponding to numbers in the $$$i$$$-th row of the grid.After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will getIdleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:fflush(stdout)orcout.flush()in C++;System.out.flush()in Java;flush(output)in Pascal;stdout.flush()in Python;see documentation for other languages.Hack FormatTo hack, use the following format.The first line should contain a single odd integer $$$n$$$ (side of your grid).The $$$i$$$-th of $$$n$$$ following lines should contain a string of length $$$n$$$ corresponding to the $$$i$$$-th row of the grid. Top left element of the grid has to be equal to $$$1$$$, bottom right has to be equal to $$$0$$$.ExampleInput3 0 1 0 1 1 1 1Output? 1 1 1 3 ? 1 1 2 3 ? 2 1 2 3 ? 3 1 3 3 ? 2 2 3 3 ? 1 2 3 2 ? 1 2 3 3 ! 100 001 000", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "29e7bdcb", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an odd-sized square grid of size $n \\times n$.
