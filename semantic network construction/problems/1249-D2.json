Too Many Segments (hard version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.You are given $$$n$$$ segments on the coordinate axis $$$OX$$$. Segments can intersect, lie inside each other and even coincide. The $$$i$$$-th segment is $$$[l_i; r_i]$$$ ($$$l_i \\\\le r_i$$$) and it covers all integer points $$$j$$$ such that $$$l_i \\\\le j \\\\le r_i$$$.The integer point is calledbadif it is covered bystrictly morethan $$$k$$$ segments.Your task is to remove the minimum number of segments so that there are nobadpoints at all.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of segments and the maximum number of segments by which each integer point can be covered.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain segments. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th segment.OutputIn the first line print one integer $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le m \\\\le n$$$) — the minimum number of segments you need to remove so that there are nobadpoints.In the second line print $$$m$$$distinctintegers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$) — indices of segments you remove in any order. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.ExamplesInput7 2 11 11 9 11 7 8 8 9 7 8 9 11 7 9Output3 4 6 7Input5 1 29 30 30 30 29 29 28 30 30 30Output3 1 4 5Input6 1 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 2 2 3 2 3Output4 1 3 5 6", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "37927f5a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ segments on a number line.
