Antennastime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ equidistant antennas on a line, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each antenna has a power rating, the power of the $$$i$$$-th antenna is $$$p_i$$$.The $$$i$$$-th and the $$$j$$$-th antenna can communicate directly if and only if their distance is at most the minimum of their powers, i.e., $$$|i-j| \\\\leq \\\\min(p_i, p_j)$$$. Sending a message directly between two such antennas takes $$$1$$$ second.What is the minimum amount of time necessary to send a message from antenna $$$a$$$ to antenna $$$b$$$, possibly using other antennas as relays?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a, b \\\\leq n \\\\leq 200\\\\,000$$$) — the number of antennas, and the origin and target antenna.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq p_i \\\\leq n$$$) — the powers of the antennas.The sum of the values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$200\\\\,000$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the number of seconds needed to trasmit a message from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$. It can be shown that under the problem constraints, it is always possible to send such a message.ExampleInput310 2 94 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 51 1 113 1 33 3 1Output4 0 2NoteIn thefirst test case, we must send a message from antenna $$$2$$$ to antenna $$$9$$$. A sequence of communications requiring $$$4$$$ seconds, which is the minimum possible amount of time, is the following:In $$$1$$$ second we send the message from antenna $$$2$$$ to antenna $$$1$$$. This is possible since $$$|2-1|\\\\le \\\\min(1, 4) = \\\\min(p_2, p_1)$$$.In $$$1$$$ second we send the message from antenna $$$1$$$ to antenna $$$5$$$. This is possible since $$$|1-5|\\\\le \\\\min(4, 5) = \\\\min(p_1, p_5)$$$.In $$$1$$$ second we send the message from antenna $$$5$$$ to antenna $$$10$$$. This is possible since $$$|5-10|\\\\le \\\\min(5, 5) = \\\\min(p_5, p_{10})$$$.In $$$1$$$ second we send the message from antenna $$$10$$$ to antenna $$$9$$$.
