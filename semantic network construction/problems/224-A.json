Parallelepipedtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYou've got a rectangular parallelepiped with integer edge lengths. You know the areas of its three faces that have a common vertex. Your task is to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of this parallelepiped.InputThe first and the single line contains three space-separated integers — the areas of the parallelepiped's faces. The area's values are positive( > 0)and do not exceed104.
