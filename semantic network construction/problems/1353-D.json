Constructing the Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of zeros. You perform $$$n$$$ actions with this array: during the $$$i$$$-th action, the following sequence of operations appears:Choose the maximum by length subarray (continuous subsegment) consistingonlyof zeros, among all such segments choose theleftmostone;Let this segment be $$$[l; r]$$$. If $$$r-l+1$$$ is odd (not divisible by $$$2$$$) then assign (set) $$$a[\\\\frac{l+r}{2}] := i$$$ (where $$$i$$$ is the number of the current action), otherwise (if $$$r-l+1$$$ is even) assign (set) $$$a[\\\\frac{l+r-1}{2}] := i$$$.Consider the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$5$$$ (initially $$$a=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$). Then it changes as follows:Firstly, we choose the segment $$$[1; 5]$$$ and assign $$$a[3] := 1$$$, so $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]$$$;then we choose the segment $$$[1; 2]$$$ and assign $$$a[1] := 2$$$, so $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 0, 1, 0, 0]$$$;then we choose the segment $$$[4; 5]$$$ and assign $$$a[4] := 3$$$, so $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 0, 1, 3, 0]$$$;then we choose the segment $$$[2; 2]$$$ and assign $$$a[2] := 4$$$, so $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 4, 1, 3, 0]$$$;and at last we choose the segment $$$[5; 5]$$$ and assign $$$a[5] := 5$$$, so $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]$$$.Your task is to find the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ after performing all $$$n$$$ actions.Note that the answer exists and unique.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ after performing $$$n$$$ actions described in the problem statement.Note that the answer exists and unique.ExampleInput6 1 2 3 4 5 6Output1  1 2  2 1 3  3 1 2 4  2 4 1 3 5  3 4 1 5 2 6", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f11c1905", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ zeros.
