Tabletime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutJohn Doe has ann×mtable. John Doe can paint points in some table cells, not more than one point in one table cell. John Doe wants to use such operations to make each square subtable of sizen×nhave exactlykpoints.John Doe wondered, how many distinct ways to fill the table with points are there, provided that the condition must hold. As this number can be rather large, John Doe asks to find its remainder after dividing by1000000007(109+ 7).You should assume that John always paints a point exactly in the center of some cell. Two ways to fill a table are considered distinct, if there exists a table cell, that has a point in one way and doesn't have it in the other.InputA single line contains space-separated integersn,m,k(1 ≤n≤ 100;n≤m≤ 1018; 0 ≤k≤n2) — the number of rows of the table, the number of columns of the table and the number of points each square must contain.Please, do not use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++.

So, if it has one point, then there shouldn't be points in any other place. If one of the white areas has a point, then the other one also must have a point. Thus, there are about20variants, where the point lies in the gray area and25variants, where each of the white areas contains a point. Overall there are45variants.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "3a5ee071", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You have a rectangular grid.
