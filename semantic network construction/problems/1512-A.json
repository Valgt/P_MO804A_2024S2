It is known that in this array, all the numbers except one are the same (for example, in the array $$$[4, 11, 4, 4]$$$ all numbers except one are equal to $$$4$$$).Print the index of the element that does not equal others. The numbers in the array are numbered from one.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 100$$$).It is guaranteed that all the numbers except one in the $$$a$$$ array are the same.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the index of the element that is not equal to others.ExampleInput4 4 11 13 11 11 5 1 4 4 4 4 10 3 3 3 3 10 3 3 3 3 3 3 20 20 10Output2 1 5 3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "01449e43", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ ($n \\ge 3$) positive integers.
