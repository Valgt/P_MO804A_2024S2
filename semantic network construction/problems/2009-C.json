The Legend of Freya the Frogtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFreya the Frog is traveling on the 2D coordinate plane. She is currently at point $$$(0,0)$$$ and wants to go to point $$$(x,y)$$$. In one move, she chooses an integer $$$d$$$ such that $$$0 \\\\leq d \\\\leq k$$$ and jumps $$$d$$$ spots forward in the direction she is facing.Initially, she is facing the positive $$$x$$$ direction. After every move, she will alternate between facing the positive $$$x$$$ direction and the positive $$$y$$$ direction (i.e., she will face the positive $$$y$$$ direction on her second move, the positive $$$x$$$ direction on her third move, and so on).What is the minimum amount of moves she must perform to land on point $$$(x,y)$$$?InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases.Each test case contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq x, y \\\\leq 10^9, 1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, output the number of jumps Freya needs to make on a new line.ExampleInput39 11 30 10 81000000 100000 10Output8 4 199999NoteIn the first sample, one optimal set of moves is if Freya jumps in the following way: ($$$0,0$$$) $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ ($$$2,0$$$) $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ ($$$2,2$$$) $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ ($$$3,2$$$) $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ ($$$3,5$$$) $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ ($$$6,5$$$) $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ ($$$6,8$$$) $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ ($$$9,8$$$) $$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ ($$$9,11$$$).
