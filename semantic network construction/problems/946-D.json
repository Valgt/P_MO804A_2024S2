There arendays in Berland week, and each of these days Ivan might have some classes at the university.There aremworking hours during each Berland day, and each lesson at the university lasts exactly one hour. If at some day Ivan's first lesson is duringi-th hour, and last lesson is duringj-th hour, then he spendsj-i+ 1hours in the university during this day. If there are no lessons during some day, then Ivan stays at home and therefore spends0hours in the university.Ivan doesn't like to spend a lot of time in the university, so he has decided to skip some lessons. He cannot skip more thanklessons during the week. After deciding which lessons he should skip and which he should attend, every day Ivan will enter the university right before the start of the first lesson he does not skip, and leave it after the end of the last lesson he decides to attend. If Ivan skips all lessons during some day, he doesn't go to the university that day at all.Givenn,m,kand Ivan's timetable, can you determine the minimum number of hours he has to spend in the university during one week, if he cannot skip more thanklessons?InputThe first line contains three integersn,mandk(1 ≤n,m≤ 500,0 ≤k≤ 500) — the number of days in the Berland week, the number of working hours during each day, and the number of lessons Ivan can skip, respectively.Thennlines follow,i-th line containing a binary string ofmcharacters. Ifj-th character ini-th line is1, then Ivan has a lesson oni-th day duringj-th hour (if it is0, there is no such lesson).OutputPrint the minimum number of hours Ivan has to spend in the university during the week if he skips not more thanklessons.ExamplesInput2 5 10100110110Output5Input2 5 00100110110Output8NoteIn the first example Ivan can skip any of two lessons during the first day, so he spends1hour during the first day and4hours during the second day.In the second example Ivan can't skip any lessons, so he spends4hours every day.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9ebd3bd4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ days in a week and each day has $m$ working hours.
