She wants to impress judges and show her mathematical skills.Her problem is following: for given string, consisting of only 0 and 1, tell if it's possible to remove some digits in such a way, that remaining number is a representation of some positive integer, divisible by 64, in the binary numerical system.InputIn the only line given a non-empty binary stringswith length up to100.OutputPrint «yes» (without quotes) if it's possible to remove digits required way and «no» otherwise.ExamplesInput100010001OutputyesInput100OutputnoNoteIn the first test case, you can get string1 000 000after removing two ones which is a representation of number64in the binary numerical system.You can read more about binary numeral system representation here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_system", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "248c41cb", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a binary string (a string consisting only of 0s and 1s), determine if it's possible to remove some digits from the string so that the remaining string represents a positive integer divisible by 64.\n\nOutput \"yes\" if it's possible and \"no\" otherwise."}, {"prompt_md5": "3cb5e413", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a binary string (made up of 0s and 1s), determine if you can remove some digits to create a binary representation of a number divisible by 64."}]}
