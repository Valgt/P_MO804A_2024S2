Maximum Crossings (Easy Version)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe only difference between the two versions is that in this version$$$n \\\\leq 1000$$$ and the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.Aterminalis a row of $$$n$$$ equal segments numbered $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in order. There are two terminals, one above the other.You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. For all $$$i = 1, 2, \\\\dots, n$$$, there should be a straight wire from some point on segment $$$i$$$ of the top terminal to some point on segment $$$a_i$$$ of the bottom terminal. You can't select the endpoints of a segment. For example, the following pictures show two possible wirings if $$$n=7$$$ and $$$a=[4,1,4,6,7,7,5]$$$.Acrossingoccurs when two wires share a point in common.
