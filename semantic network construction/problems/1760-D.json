This array is called a \"valley\" if there existsexactly onesubarray $$$a[l \\\\dots r]$$$ such that:$$$0 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n-1$$$,$$$a_l = a_{l+1} = a_{l+2} = \\\\dots = a_r$$$,$$$l = 0$$$ or $$$a_{l-1} > a_{l}$$$,$$$r = n-1$$$ or $$$a_r < a_{r+1}$$$.Here are three examples:The first image shows the array [$$$3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3$$$], itis a valleybecause only subarray with indices $$$l=r=3$$$ satisfies the condition.The second image shows the array [$$$1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6$$$], itis a valleybecause only subarray with indices $$$l=0, r=2$$$ satisfies the codition.The third image shows the array [$$$1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1$$$], itis not a valleybecause two subarrays $$$l=r=0$$$ and $$$l=r=6$$$ that satisfy the condition.You are asked whether the given array is a valley or not.Note that we consider the array to be indexed from $$$0$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases is smaller than $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if the array is a valley, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput673 2 2 1 2 2 3111 1 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 6 671 2 3 4 3 2 179 7 4 6 9 9 101100000000089 4 4 5 9 4 9 10OutputYES YES NO YES YES NONoteThe first three test cases are explained in the statement.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "cd20dd26", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
