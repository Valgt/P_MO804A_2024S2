Division Avoidancetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA newly discovered organism can be represented as a set of cells on an infinite grid. There is a coordinate system on the grid such that each cell has two integer coordinates $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. A cell with coordinates $$$x=a$$$ and $$$y=b$$$ will be denoted as $$$(a, b)$$$.Initially, the organism consists of a single cell $$$(0, 0)$$$. Then zero or moredivisionscan happen. In one division, a cell $$$(a, b)$$$ is removed and replaced by two cells $$$(a+1, b)$$$ and $$$(a, b+1)$$$.For example, after the first division, the organism always consists of two cells $$$(1, 0)$$$ and $$$(0, 1)$$$, and after the second division, it is either the three cells $$$(2, 0)$$$, $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(0, 1)$$$, or the three cells $$$(1, 0)$$$, $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(0, 2)$$$.A division of a cell $$$(a, b)$$$ can only happen if the cells $$$(a+1, b)$$$ and $$$(a, b+1)$$$ are not yet part of the organism.For example, the cell $$$(1, 0)$$$ cannot divide if the organism currently consists of the three cells $$$(1, 0)$$$, $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(0, 2)$$$, since the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ that would be one of the results of this division is already part of the organism.You are given a set of forbidden cells $$${(c_i, d_i)}$$$. Is it possible for the organism to contain none of those cells after zero or more divisions?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the number of forbidden cells.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers each. The $$$i$$$-th of such lines contains $$$c_i$$$ and $$$d_i$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le c_i, d_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th forbidden cell. It is guaranteed that all forbidden cells are distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$\\\\texttt{YES}$$$ if it is possible for the organism to contain no forbidden cells after zero or more divisions. Otherwise, print $$$\\\\texttt{NO}$$$.ExampleInput240 01 00 11 1160 00 10 20 31 01 11 21 32 02 12 22 33 03 13 23 3OutputYES NONoteIn thefirst test case, dividing the following cells in the following order creates an organism without any forbidden cells: $$$(0, 0)$$$, $$$(1, 0)$$$, $$$(1, 1)$$$, $$$(0, 1)$$$, $$$(2, 1)$$$, $$$(2, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 1)$$$.
