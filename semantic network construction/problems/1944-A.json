Destroying Bridgestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ islands, numbered $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, n$$$. Initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of $$$\\\\frac{n (n - 1)}{2}$$$ bridges.Everule lives on island $$$1$$$ and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges. Dominater has the power to destroy at most $$$k$$$ bridges to minimize the number of islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.Find the minimum number of islands (including island $$$1$$$) that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$, $$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le \\\\frac{n \\\\cdot (n - 1)}{2}$$$).OutputFor each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.ExampleInput62 02 14 15 105 34 4Output2 1 4 1 5 1NoteIn the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands will be reachable.In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$. Everule will not be able to visit island $$$2$$$ but can still visit island $$$1$$$. Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is $$$1$$$.In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge between islands $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, Everule can still visit island $$$2$$$ by traveling by $$$1 \\\\to 3 \\\\to 2$$$ as the bridges between $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$, and between $$$3$$$ and $$$2$$$ are not destroyed.In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since $$$k = \\\\frac{n \\\\cdot (n - 1)}{2}$$$. Everule will be only able to visit $$$1$$$ island (island $$$1$$$).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c44254df", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ islands numbered 1 through $n$.
