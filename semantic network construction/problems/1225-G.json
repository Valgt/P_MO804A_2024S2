Also, a positive number $$$k \\\\geq 2$$$ is chosen, and none of the numbers on the blackboard are divisible by $$$k$$$. In one operation, you can choose any two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, erase them and write one extra number $$$f(x + y)$$$, where $$$f(x)$$$ is equal to $$$x$$$ if $$$x$$$ is not divisible by $$$k$$$, otherwise $$$f(x) = f(x / k)$$$.In the end, there will be a single number of the blackboard. Is it possible to make the final number equal to $$$1$$$? If so, restore any sequence of operations to do so.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ — the initial number of integers on the blackboard, and the chosen number ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 16$$$, $$$2 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 2000$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ initially written on the blackboard. It is guaranteed that none of the numbers $$$a_i$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$, and the sum of all $$$a_i$$$ does not exceed $$$2000$$$.OutputIf it is impossible to obtain $$$1$$$ as the final number, print \"NO\" in the only line.Otherwise, print \"YES\" on the first line, followed by $$$n - 1$$$ lines describing operations. The $$$i$$$-th of these lines has to contain two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ to be erased and replaced with $$$f(x_i + y_i)$$$ on the $$$i$$$-th operation.
