Bender Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutRobot Bender decided to make Fray a birthday present. He drovennails and numbered them from1tonin some order. Bender decided to make a picture using metal rods. The picture is a closed polyline, which vertices should be nails (in the given order). The segments of the polyline should be parallel to the coordinate axes. Polyline is allowed to have self-intersections. Bender can take a rod and fold it exactly once in any place to form an angle of 90 degrees. Then he can attach the place of the fold to some unoccupied nail and attach two ends of this rod to adjacent nails. A nail is considered unoccupied if there is no rod attached to it (neither by it's end nor the by the fold place). No rod could be used twice. It is not required to use all the rods.Help Bender to solve this difficult task.InputThe first line contains two positive integersnandm(4 ≤n≤ 500, 2 ≤m≤ 500,nis even) — the amount of nails and the amount of rods.i-th of the followingnlines contains a pair of integers, denoting the coordinates of thei-th nail. Nails should be connected in the same order as they are given in the input. The last line containsmintegers — the lenghts of the rods. All coordinates do not exceed104by absolute value. Lengths of the rods are between1and200 000. No rod can be used twice. It is guaranteed that all segments of the given polyline are parallel to coordinate axes. No three consecutive nails lie on the same line.OutputIf it is impossible to solve Bender's problem, outputNO. Otherwise, outputYESin the first line, and in the second line outputnnumbers —i-th of them should be the number of rod, which fold place is attached to thei-th nail, or-1, if there is no such rod.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput4 20 00 22 22 04 4OutputYES1 -1 2 -1Input6 30 01 01 12 12 20 23 2 3OutputYES1 -1 2 -1 3 -1Input6 30 01 01 12 12 20 22 2 3OutputNO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "49100f5a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of points on a 2D plane and a set of rods.  \n\n* The points represent nails.\n* The rods can be folded in half at any point to form a 90-degree angle.\n\nThe goal is to determine if it is possible to connect the nails using the rods, where:\n\n* Each rod can only be used once.\n* A rod can be attached to two nails, with the fold point attaching to a third nail.\n* A nail can only be attached to one rod.\n\nIf it is possible, output \"YES\" and a list of which rod's fold point is attached to each nail.
