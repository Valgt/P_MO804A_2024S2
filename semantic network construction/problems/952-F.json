The task was very simple - given an arithmetic expression, return the result of evaluating this expression. However, looks like there is a bug in the reference solution...InputThe only line of input data contains the arithmetic expression. The expression will contain between 2 and 10 operands, separated with arithmetic signs plus and/or minus. Each operand will be an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.OutputReproduce the output of the reference solution, including the bug.ExamplesInput8-7+6-5+4-3+2-1-0Output4Input2+2Output-46Input112-37Output375", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "773fe337", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an arithmetic expression consisting of integers between 0 and 255, inclusive, separated by plus and minus signs, calculate the result of the expression.  \n\n**Input:**\n\nA single line containing the arithmetic expression.\n\n**Output:**\n\nThe result of evaluating the expression. \n\n**Examples:**\n\nInput: $8-7+6-5+4-3+2-1-0$\nOutput: 4\n\nInput: $2+2$\nOutput: -46\n\nInput: $112-37$\nOutput: 375"}, {"prompt_md5": "d57d1a15", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a series of numbers and plus or minus signs, calculate the result.
