Masha became interested what is the largest naturalxsuch she can make using her new cubes all integers from 1 tox.To make a number Masha can rotate her cubes and put them in a row. After that, she looks at upper faces of cubes from left to right and reads the number.The number can't contain leading zeros. It's not required to use all cubes to build a number.Pay attention: Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations.InputIn first line integernis given (1 ≤n≤ 3) — the number of cubes, Masha got for her birthday.Each of nextnlines contains 6 integersaij(0 ≤aij≤ 9) — number onj-th face ofi-th cube.OutputPrint single integer — maximum numberxsuch Masha can make any integers from 1 toxusing her cubes or 0 if Masha can't make even 1.ExamplesInput30 1 2 3 4 56 7 8 9 0 12 3 4 5 6 7Output87Input30 1 3 5 6 81 2 4 5 7 82 3 4 6 7 9Output98NoteIn the first test case, Masha can build all numbers from 1 to 87, but she can't make 88 because there are no two cubes with digit 8.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "24c7ece4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 3$) cubes.
