Cube Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYaroslav, Andrey and Roman love playing cubes. Sometimes they get together and play cubes for hours and hours!Today they got together again and they are playing cubes. Yaroslav took unit cubes and composed them into ana×a×acube, Andrey made ab×b×bcube and Roman made ac×c×ccube. After that the game was finished and the guys left. But later, Vitaly entered the room. He saw the cubes and wanted to make a cube as well. But what size should the cube be? Of course it should be a large cube with the side of lengtha+b+c. Besides, Vitaly decided to decompose the cubes built by Yaroslav, Andrey and Roman and compose his own large cube out of them. However, it turned out that the unit cubes he got from destroying the three cubes just weren't enough to make a large cube. We know that Vitaly was short of exactlyncubes. Vitaly got upset, demolished everything and left. As he was leaving, he met Petya and told him that there had been three cubes in the room and that he needed anothernunit cubes to make his own large cube.Petya entered the room and saw the messily scattered cubes. He wanted to make it neat and orderly again. But he only knows that there had been three cubes, made of small unit cubes and that Vitaly needednmore unit cubes to make a large one! Help Petya understand, how many ways of sizesa,b,care there to restore Yaroslav's, Andrey's and Roman's cubes.InputThe single line of the input contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 1014).
