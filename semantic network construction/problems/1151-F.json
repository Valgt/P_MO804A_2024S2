Sonya and Informaticstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA girl named Sonya is studying in the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland. The teacher of computer science (Sonya's favorite subject!) invented a task for her.Given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$,consisting only of the numbers $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$, and the number $$$k$$$.Exactly $$$k$$$ timesthe following happens:Two numbers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are chosen equiprobable such that ($$$1 \\\\leq i < j \\\\leq n$$$).The numbers in the $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ positions are swapped.Sonya's task is to find the probability that after all the operations are completed, the $$$a$$$ array will besorted in non-decreasing order. She turned to you for help. Help Sonya solve this problem.It can be shown that the desired probability is either $$$0$$$ or it can be represented as $$$\\\\dfrac{P}{Q}$$$, where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are coprime integers and $$$Q \\\\not\\\\equiv 0~\\\\pmod {10^9+7}$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100, 1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of operations.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 1$$$) — the description of the array $$$a$$$.OutputIf the desired probability is $$$0$$$, print $$$0$$$, otherwise print the value $$$P \\\\cdot Q^{-1}$$$ $$$\\\\pmod {10^9+7}$$$, where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are defined above.ExamplesInput3 2 0 1 0Output333333336Input5 1 1 1 1 0 0Output0Input6 4 1 0 0 1 1 0Output968493834NoteIn the first example, all possible variants of the final array $$$a$$$, after applying exactly two operations: $$$(0, 1, 0)$$$, $$$(0, 0, 1)$$$, $$$(1, 0, 0)$$$, $$$(1, 0, 0)$$$, $$$(0, 1, 0)$$$, $$$(0, 0, 1)$$$, $$$(0, 0, 1)$$$, $$$(1, 0, 0)$$$, $$$(0, 1, 0)$$$. Therefore, the answer is $$$\\\\dfrac{3}{9}=\\\\dfrac{1}{3}$$$.In the second example, the array will not be sorted in non-decreasing order after one operation, therefore the answer is $$$0$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "578783fb", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of length $n$ consisting of 0s and 1s.
