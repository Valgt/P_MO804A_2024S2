Absolute Sortingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. The array is sorted if $$$a_1 \\\\le a_2 \\\\le \\\\dots \\\\le a_n$$$.You want to make the array $$$a$$$ sorted by applying the following operationexactly once:choose an integer $$$x$$$, then for every $$$i \\\\in [1, n]$$$, replace $$$a_i$$$ by $$$|a_i - x|$$$.Find any value of $$$x$$$ that will make the array sorted, or report that there is no such value.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^8$$$).Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print any integer $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^9$$$) that makes the array sorted. It can be shown that if such an integer $$$x$$$ exists, there is at least one such integer between $$$0$$$ and $$$10^9$$$.If there is no such integer, then print $$$-1$$$. If there are multiple suitable values of $$$x$$$, print any of them.ExampleInput855 3 3 3 545 3 4 581 2 3 4 5 6 7 8610 5 4 3 2 133 3 1342 43 422100000000 99999999629613295 52036613 75100585 78027446 81409090 73215Output4 -1 0 42 2 -1 100000000 40741153NoteIn the first test case, after using $$$x = 4$$$, the array becomes $$$[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$.In the third test case, after using $$$x = 0$$$, the array becomes $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]$$$.In the fourth test case, after using $$$x = 42$$$, the array becomes $$$[32, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "74eee0f2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
