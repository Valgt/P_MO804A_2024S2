Inverse of Rows and Columnstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a binary matrix $$$a$$$ of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$. A binary matrix is a matrix where each element is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.You may perform some (possibly zero) operations with this matrix. During each operation you can inverse the row of this matrix or a column of this matrix. Formally, inverting a row is changing all values in this row to the opposite ($$$0$$$ to $$$1$$$, $$$1$$$ to $$$0$$$). Inverting a column is changing all values in this column to the opposite.Your task is to sort the initial matrix by some sequence of such operations. The matrix is consideredsortedif the array $$$[a_{1, 1}, a_{1, 2}, \\\\dots, a_{1, m}, a_{2, 1}, a_{2, 2}, \\\\dots, a_{2, m}, \\\\dots, a_{n, m - 1}, a_{n, m}]$$$ is sortedin non-descending order.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 200$$$) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the matrix.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ integers each. The $$$j$$$-th element in the $$$i$$$-th line is $$$a_{i, j}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_{i, j} \\\\le 1$$$) — the element of $$$a$$$ at position $$$(i, j)$$$.OutputIf it is impossible to obtain asortedmatrix, print \"NO\" in the first line.Otherwise print \"YES\" in the first line. In the second line print a string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th character $$$r_i$$$ of this string should be '1' if the $$$i$$$-th row of the matrix is inverted and '0' otherwise. In the third line print a string $$$c$$$ of length $$$m$$$. The $$$j$$$-th character $$$c_j$$$ of this string should be '1' if the $$$j$$$-th column of the matrix is inverted and '0' otherwise. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.ExamplesInput2 2 1 1 0 1OutputYES 00 10Input3 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1OutputYES 010 0000Input3 3 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0OutputNO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "3fcd1b82", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a matrix of 0s and 1s.
