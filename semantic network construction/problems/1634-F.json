Fibonacci Additionstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOne of my most productive days was throwing away 1,000 lines of code.— Ken ThompsonFibonacci additionis an operation on an array $$$X$$$ of integers, parametrized by indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. Fibonacci addition increases $$$X_l$$$ by $$$F_1$$$, increases $$$X_{l + 1}$$$ by $$$F_2$$$, and so on up to $$$X_r$$$ which is increased by $$$F_{r - l + 1}$$$.$$$F_i$$$ denotes the $$$i$$$-th Fibonacci number ($$$F_1 = 1$$$, $$$F_2 = 1$$$, $$$F_{i} = F_{i - 1} + F_{i - 2}$$$ for $$$i > 2$$$), andall operations are performed modulo $$$MOD$$$.You are given two arrays $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ of the same length. We will ask you to perform several Fibonacci additions on these arrays with different parameters, and after each operation you have to report whether arrays $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are equal modulo $$$MOD$$$.InputThe first line contains 3 numbers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ and $$$MOD$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, q \\\\le 3\\\\cdot 10^5, 1 \\\\le MOD \\\\le 10^9+7$$$) — the length of the arrays, the number of operations, and the number modulo which all operations are performed.The second line contains $$$n$$$ numbers — array $$$A$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le A_i < MOD$$$).The third line also contains $$$n$$$ numbers — array $$$B$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le B_i < MOD$$$).The next $$$q$$$ lines contain character $$$c$$$ and two numbers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$) — operation parameters. If $$$c$$$ is \"A\", Fibonacci addition is to be performed on array $$$A$$$, and if it is is \"B\", the operation is to be performed on $$$B$$$.OutputAfter each operation, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if the arrays are equal and \"NO\" otherwise.
