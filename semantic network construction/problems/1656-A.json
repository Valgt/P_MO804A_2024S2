Good Pairstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ of positive integers. Agood pairis a pair of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ with $$$1 \\\\leq i, j \\\\leq n$$$ such that, for all $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n$$$, the following equality holds:$$$$$$ |a_i - a_k| + |a_k - a_j| = |a_i - a_j|, $$$$$$ where $$$|x|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$x$$$.Find a good pair. Note that $$$i$$$ can be equal to $$$j$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of the array.The sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases is at most $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single line with two space-separated indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ which form a good pair of the array. The case $$$i=j$$$ is allowed. It can be shown that such a pair always exists. If there are multiple good pairs, print any of them.ExampleInput335 2 751 4 2 2 312Output2 3 1 2 1 1NoteIn the first case, for $$$i = 2$$$ and $$$j = 3$$$ the equality holds true for all $$$k$$$:$$$k = 1$$$: $$$|a_2 - a_1| + |a_1 - a_3| = |2 - 5| + |5 - 7| = 5 = |2 - 7| = |a_2-a_3|$$$,$$$k = 2$$$: $$$|a_2 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_3| = |2 - 2| + |2 - 7| = 5 = |2 - 7| = |a_2-a_3|$$$,$$$k = 3$$$: $$$|a_2 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_3| = |2 - 7| + |7 - 7| = 5 = |2 - 7| = |a_2-a_3|$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "beffb557", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of positive integers.
