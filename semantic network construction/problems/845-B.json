Luba And The Tickettime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLuba has a ticket consisting of6digits. In one move she can choose digit in any position and replace it with arbitrary digit. She wants to know the minimum number of digits she needs to replace in order to make the ticket lucky.The ticket is considered lucky if the sum of first three digits equals to the sum of last three digits.InputYou are given a string consisting of6characters (all characters are digits from0to9) — this string denotes Luba's ticket. The ticket can start with the digit0.OutputPrint one number — the minimum possible number of digits Luba needs to replace to make the ticket lucky.ExamplesInput000000Output0Input123456Output2Input111000Output1NoteIn the first example the ticket is already lucky, so the answer is0.In the second example Luba can replace4and5with zeroes, and the ticket will become lucky. It's easy to see that at least two replacements are required.In the third example Luba can replace any zero with3. It's easy to see that at least one replacement is required.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "914d1f48", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a 6-digit number.
