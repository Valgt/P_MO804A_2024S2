Self-explorationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBeing bored of exploring the Moon over and over again Wall-B decided to explore something he is made of â€” binary numbers. He took a binary number and decided to count how many times different substrings of length two appeared. He stored those values in $$$c_{00}$$$, $$$c_{01}$$$, $$$c_{10}$$$ and $$$c_{11}$$$, representing how many times substrings00,01,10and11appear in the number respectively. For example:$$$10111100 \\\\rightarrow c_{00} = 1, \\\\ c_{01} = 1,\\\\ c_{10} = 2,\\\\ c_{11} = 3$$$$$$10000 \\\\rightarrow c_{00} = 3,\\\\ c_{01} = 0,\\\\ c_{10} = 1,\\\\ c_{11} = 0$$$$$$10101001 \\\\rightarrow c_{00} = 1,\\\\ c_{01} = 3,\\\\ c_{10} = 3,\\\\ c_{11} = 0$$$$$$1 \\\\rightarrow c_{00} = 0,\\\\ c_{01} = 0,\\\\ c_{10} = 0,\\\\ c_{11} = 0$$$Wall-B noticed that there can be multiple binary numbers satisfying the same $$$c_{00}$$$, $$$c_{01}$$$, $$$c_{10}$$$ and $$$c_{11}$$$ constraints. Because of that he wanted to count how many binary numbers satisfy the constraints $$$c_{xy}$$$ given the interval $$$[A, B]$$$. Unfortunately, his processing power wasn't strong enough to handle large intervals he was curious about. Can you help him? Since this number can be large print it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.InputFirst two lines contain two positive binary numbers $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq A \\\\leq B < 2^{100\\\\,000}$$$), representing the start and the end of the interval respectively. Binary numbers $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ have no leading zeroes.Next four lines contain decimal numbers $$$c_{00}$$$, $$$c_{01}$$$, $$$c_{10}$$$ and $$$c_{11}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{10}, c_{11} \\\\leq 100\\\\,000$$$) representing the count of two-digit substrings00,01,10and11respectively.OutputOutput one integer number representing how many binary numbers in the interval $$$[A, B]$$$ satisfy the constraints mod $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExamplesInput1010010011Output1Input10100011234Output0NoteExample 1: The binary numbers in the interval $$$[10,1001]$$$ are $$$10,11,100,101,110,111,1000,1001$$$.
