Partitioning the Arraytime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAllen has an array $$$a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$. For every positive integer $$$k$$$ that is a divisor of $$$n$$$, Allen does the following:He partitions the array into $$$\\\\frac{n}{k}$$$ disjoint subarrays of length $$$k$$$. In other words, he partitions the array into the following subarrays: $$$$$$[a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_k],[a_{k+1}, a_{k+2},\\\\ldots,a_{2k}],\\\\ldots,[a_{n-k+1},a_{n-k+2},\\\\ldots,a_{n}]$$$$$$Allen earns one point if there exists some positive integer $$$m$$$ ($$$m \\\\geq 2$$$) such that if he replaces every element in the array with its remainder when divided by $$$m$$$, then all subarrays will be identical.Help Allen find the number of points he will earn.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of points Allen will earn.ExampleInput841 2 1 431 2 351 1 1 1 161 3 1 1 3 166 2 6 2 2 262 6 3 6 6 6101 7 5 1 4 3 1 3 1 411Output2 1 2 4 4 1 2 1NoteIn the first test case, $$$k=2$$$ earns a point since Allen can pick $$$m = 2$$$ and both subarrays will be equal to $$$[1, 0]$$$. $$$k=4$$$ also earns a point, since no matter what $$$m$$$ Allen chooses, there will be only one subarray and thus all subarrays are equal.In the second test case, Allen earns $$$1$$$ point for $$$k=3$$$, where his choice for $$$m$$$ does not matter.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "22f9a43e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
