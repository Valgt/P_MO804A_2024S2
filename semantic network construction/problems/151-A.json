Soft Drinkingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThis winter is so cold in Nvodsk! A group ofnfriends decided to buykbottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle haslmilliliters of the drink. Also they boughtclimes and cut each of them intodslices. After that they foundpgrams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needsnlmilliliters of the drink, a slice of lime andnpgrams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?InputThe first and only line containspositiveintegersn,k,l,c,d,p,nl,np, not exceeding1000and no less than1.

The limes are enough for10 * 8 = 80toasts and the salt is enough for100 / 1 = 100toasts.
