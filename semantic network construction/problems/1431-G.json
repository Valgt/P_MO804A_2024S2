Number Deletion Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob play a game. They have a set that initially consists of $$$n$$$ integers. The game is played in $$$k$$$ turns. During each turn, the following events happen:firstly, Alice chooses an integer from the set. She can choose any integerexcept for the maximum one. Let the integer chosen by Alice be $$$a$$$;secondly, Bob chooses an integer from the set. He can choose any integerthat is greater than $$$a$$$. Let the integer chosen by Bob be $$$b$$$;finally, both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are erased from the set, and the value of $$$b - a$$$ is added to the score of the game.Initially, the score is $$$0$$$. Alice wants to maximize the resulting score, Bob wants to minimize it.
