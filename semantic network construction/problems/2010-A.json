Alternating Sum of Numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a sequence of integers. Output thealternatingsum of this sequence. In other words, output $$$a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + a_5 - \\\\dots$$$. That is, the signs of plus and minus alternate, starting with a plus.InputThe first line of the test contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follow $$$t$$$ test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$) — the length of the sequence. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 100$$$).OutputOutput $$$t$$$ lines.
