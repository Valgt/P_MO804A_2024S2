Are You Fired?time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLevian works as an accountant in a large company. Levian knows how much the company has earned in each of the $$$n$$$ consecutive months — in the $$$i$$$-th month the company had income equal to $$$a_i$$$ (positive income means profit, negative income means loss, zero income means no change). Because of the general self-isolation, the first $$$\\\\lceil \\\\tfrac{n}{2} \\\\rceil$$$ months income might have been completely unstable, but then everything stabilized and for the last $$$\\\\lfloor \\\\tfrac{n}{2} \\\\rfloor$$$ monthsthe income was the same.Levian decided to tell the directors $$$n-k+1$$$ numbers — the total income of the company for each $$$k$$$ consecutive months. In other words, for each $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n-k+1$$$ he will say the value $$$a_i + a_{i+1} + \\\\ldots + a_{i + k - 1}$$$. For example, if $$$a=[-1, 0, 1, 2, 2]$$$ and $$$k=3$$$ he will say the numbers $$$0, 3, 5$$$.Unfortunately, if at least one total income reported by Levian is not a profit (income $$$\\\\le 0$$$), the directors will get angry and fire the failed accountant.Save Levian's career: find any such $$$k$$$, that for each $$$k$$$ months in a row the company had made a profit, or report that it is impossible.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 5\\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of months for which Levian must account.The second line contains $$$\\\\lceil{\\\\frac{n}{2}}\\\\rceil$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{\\\\lceil{\\\\frac{n}{2}}\\\\rceil}$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the income of the company in the $$$i$$$-th month.Third line contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^9$$$) — income in every month from $$$\\\\lceil{\\\\frac{n}{2}}\\\\rceil + 1$$$ to $$$n$$$.OutputIn a single line, print the appropriate integer $$$k$$$ or $$$-1$$$, if it does not exist.If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any.ExamplesInput3 2 -1 2Output2Input5 2 2 -8 2Output-1Input6 -2 -2 6 -1Output4NoteIn the first example, $$$k=2$$$ and $$$k=3$$$ satisfy: in the first case, Levian will report the numbers $$$1, 1$$$, and in the second case — one number $$$3$$$.In the second example, there is no such $$$k$$$.In the third example, the only answer is $$$k=4$$$: he will report the numbers $$$1,2,3$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "491ca85a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, representing the income of a company for each of $n$ consecutive months.
