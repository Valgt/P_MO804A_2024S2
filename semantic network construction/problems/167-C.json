Wizards and Numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutIn some country live wizards. They love playing with numbers.The blackboard has two numbers written on it —aandb. The order of the numbers is not important. Let's considera≤bfor the sake of definiteness. The players can cast one of the two spells in turns:Replacebwithb-ak. Numberkcan be chosen by the player, considering the limitations thatk> 0andb-ak≥ 0. Numberkis chosen independently each time an active player casts a spell.Replacebwithbmoda.Ifa>b, similar moves are possible.If at least one of the numbers equals zero, a player can't make a move, because taking a remainder modulo zero is considered somewhat uncivilized, and it is far too boring to subtract a zero. The player who cannot make a move, loses.To perform well in the magic totalizator, you need to learn to quickly determine which player wins, if both wizards play optimally: the one that moves first or the one that moves second.InputThe first line contains a single integert— the number of input data sets (1 ≤t≤ 104). Each of the nexttlines contains two integersa,b(0 ≤a,b≤ 1018). The numbers are separated by a space.Please do not use the%lldspecificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use thecin,coutstreams or the%I64dspecificator.OutputFor any of thetinput sets print \"First\" (without the quotes) if the player who moves first wins. Print \"Second\" (without the quotes) if the player who moves second wins. Print the answers to different data sets on different lines in the order in which they are given in the input.ExamplesInput410 2131 100 110 30OutputFirstSecondSecondFirstNoteIn the first sample, the first player should go to (11,10). Then, after a single move of the second player to (1,10), he will take 10 modulo 1 and win.In the second sample the first player has two moves to (1,10) and (21,10). After both moves the second player can win.In the third sample, the first player has no moves.In the fourth sample, the first player wins in one move, taking 30 modulo 10.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9791a74d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two non-negative integers, $a$ and $b$ ($a \\le b$).
