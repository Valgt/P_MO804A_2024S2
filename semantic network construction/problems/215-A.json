Bicycle Chaintime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutVasya's bicycle chain drive consists of two parts:nstars are attached to the pedal axle,mstars are attached to the rear wheel axle. The chain helps to rotate the rear wheel by transmitting the pedal rotation.We know that thei-th star on the pedal axle hasai(0 <a1<a2< ... <an)teeth, and thej-th star on the rear wheel axle hasbj(0 <b1<b2< ... <bm)teeth. Any pair(i,j)(1 ≤i≤n;1 ≤j≤m)is called agearand sets the indexes of stars to which the chain is currently attached. Gear(i,j)has a gear ratio, equal to the value.Since Vasya likes integers, he wants to find such gears(i,j), that their ratios are integers. On the other hand, Vasya likes fast driving, so among all \"integer\" gears(i,j)he wants to choose a gear with the maximum ratio. Help him to find the number of such gears.In the problem, fractiondenotes division in real numbers, that is, no rounding is performed.InputThe first input line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 50)— the number of stars on the bicycle's pedal axle. The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 104)in the order of strict increasing.The third input line contains integerm(1 ≤m≤ 50)— the number of stars on the rear wheel axle. The fourth line containsmintegersb1,b2, ...,bm(1 ≤bi≤ 104)in the order of strict increasing.It is guaranteed that there exists at least one gear (i,j), that its gear ratio is an integer. The numbers on the lines are separated by spaces.OutputPrint the number of \"integer\" gears with the maximum ratio among all \"integer\" gears.ExamplesInput24 5312 13 15Output2Input41 2 3 4510 11 12 13 14Output1NoteIn the first sample the maximum \"integer\" gear ratio equals 3.
