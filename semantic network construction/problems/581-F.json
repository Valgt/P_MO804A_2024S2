Zublicanes and Mumocratestime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt's election time in Berland. The favorites are of course parties of zublicanes and mumocrates. The election campaigns of both parties include numerous demonstrations onnmain squares of the capital of Berland. Each of thensquares certainly can have demonstrations of only one party, otherwise it could lead to riots. On the other hand, both parties have applied to host a huge number of demonstrations, so that on all squares demonstrations must be held. Now the capital management will distribute the area between the two parties.Some pairs of squares are connected by(n- 1)bidirectional roads such that between any pair of squares there is a unique way to get from one square to another. Some squares are on the outskirts of the capital meaning that they are connected by a road with only one other square, such squares are calleddead endsquares.The mayor of the capital instructed to distribute all the squares between the parties so that thedead endsquares had the same number of demonstrations of the first and the second party. It is guaranteed that the number of dead end squares of the city is even.To prevent possible conflicts between the zublicanes and the mumocrates it was decided to minimize the number of roads connecting the squares with the distinct parties. You, as a developer of the department of distributing squares, should determine this smallest number.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 5000) — the number of squares in the capital of Berland.Nextn- 1lines contain the pairs of integersx,y(1 ≤x,y≤n,x≠y) — the numbers of the squares connected by the road. All squares are numbered with integers from1ton. It is guaranteed that the number of dead end squares of the city is even.OutputPrint a single number — the minimum number of roads connecting the squares with demonstrations of different parties.ExamplesInput81 42 43 46 57 58 54 5Output1Input51 21 31 41 5Output2", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "bf78e244", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ squares in a city, connected by $n-1$ roads.
