Divisor Pathstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a positive integer $$$D$$$. Let's build the following graph from it:each vertex is a divisor of $$$D$$$ (not necessarily prime, $$$1$$$ and $$$D$$$ itself are also included);two vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$x > y$$$) have an undirected edge between them if $$$x$$$ is divisible by $$$y$$$ and $$$\\\\frac x y$$$ is a prime;the weight of an edge is the number of divisors of $$$x$$$ that are not divisors of $$$y$$$.For example, here is the graph for $$$D=12$$$:Edge $$$(4,12)$$$ has weight $$$3$$$ because $$$12$$$ has divisors $$$[1,2,3,4,6,12]$$$ and $$$4$$$ has divisors $$$[1,2,4]$$$. Thus, there are $$$3$$$ divisors of $$$12$$$ that are not divisors of $$$4$$$ — $$$[3,6,12]$$$.There is no edge between $$$3$$$ and $$$2$$$ because $$$3$$$ is not divisible by $$$2$$$. There is no edge between $$$12$$$ and $$$3$$$ because $$$\\\\frac{12}{3}=4$$$ is not a prime.Let the length of the path between some vertices $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ in the graph be the total weight of edges on it. For example, path $$$[(1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 12), (12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 6)]$$$ has length $$$1+2+2+3+1+2=11$$$. The empty path has length $$$0$$$.So the shortest path between two vertices $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ is the path that has the minimal possible length.Two paths $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are different if there is either a different number of edges in them or there is a position $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ are different edges.You are given $$$q$$$ queries of the following form:$$$v$$$ $$$u$$$ — calculate thenumber of the shortest pathsbetween vertices $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$.The answer for each query might be large so print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le D \\\\le 10^{15}$$$) — the number the graph is built from.The second line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v, u \\\\le D$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$D$$$ is divisible by both $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ (both $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ are divisors of $$$D$$$).OutputPrint $$$q$$$ integers — for each query output thenumber of the shortest pathsbetween the two given vertices modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExamplesInput12 3 4 4 12 1 3 4Output1 3 1Input1 1 1 1Output1Input288807105787200 4 46 482955026400 12556830686400 897 414 12556830686400 4443186242880 325Output547558588 277147129 457421435 702277623NoteIn the first example:The first query is only the empty path — length $$$0$$$;The second query are paths $$$[(12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 1)]$$$ (length $$$3+1+1=5$$$), $$$[(12, 6), (6, 2), (2, 1)]$$$ (length $$$2+2+1=5$$$) and $$$[(12, 6), (6, 3), (3, 1)]$$$ (length $$$2+2+1=5$$$).The third query is only the path $$$[(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4)]$$$ (length $$$1+1+1=3$$$).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4dfd26f5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a positive integer $D$.  \n\n**Building the Graph:**\n\n* Each vertex in the graph represents a divisor of $D$.\n* There is an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$ ($x > y$) if:\n    * $x$ is divisible by $y$.\n    * The quotient $\\frac{x}{y}$ is a prime number.\n* The weight of the edge between $x$ and $y$ is the number of divisors of $x$ that are not divisors of $y$.\n\n**Queries:**\n\nYou will be given $q$ queries, each consisting of two integers $v$ and $u$ (both divisors of $D$).
