Devu and Birthday Celebrationtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutToday is Devu's birthday. For celebrating the occasion, he boughtnsweets from the nearby market. He has invited hisffriends. He would like to distribute the sweets among them. As he is a nice guy and the occasion is great, he doesn't want any friend to be sad, so he would ensure to give at least one sweet to each friend.He wants to celebrate it in a unique style, so he would like to ensure following condition for the distribution of sweets. Assume that he has distributednsweets to his friends such thatithfriend is givenaisweets. He wants to make sure that there should not be any positive integerx> 1, which divides everyai.Please find the number of ways he can distribute sweets to his friends in the required way. Note that the order of distribution is important, for example [1, 2] and [2, 1] are distinct distributions. As the answer could be very large, output answer modulo1000000007(109+ 7).To make the problem more interesting, you are givenqqueries. Each query contains ann,fpair. For each query please output the required number of ways modulo1000000007(109+ 7).InputThe first line contains an integerqrepresenting the number of queries(1 ≤q≤ 105). Each of the nextqlines contains two space space-separated integersn,f(1 ≤f≤n≤ 105).OutputFor each query, output a single integer in a line corresponding to the answer of each query.ExamplesInput56 27 26 36 47 4Output2691020NoteFor first query:n= 6,f= 2.
