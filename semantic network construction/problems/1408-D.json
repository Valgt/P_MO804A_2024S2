Searchlightstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ robbers at coordinates $$$(a_1, b_1)$$$, $$$(a_2, b_2)$$$, ..., $$$(a_n, b_n)$$$ and $$$m$$$ searchlight at coordinates $$$(c_1, d_1)$$$, $$$(c_2, d_2)$$$, ..., $$$(c_m, d_m)$$$.In one move you can move each robber to the right (increase $$$a_i$$$ of each robber by one) or move each robber up (increase $$$b_i$$$ of each robber by one). Note that you should either increaseall$$$a_i$$$ orall$$$b_i$$$, youcan'tincrease $$$a_i$$$ for some points and $$$b_i$$$ for some other points.Searchlight $$$j$$$ can see a robber $$$i$$$ if $$$a_i \\\\leq c_j$$$ and $$$b_i \\\\leq d_j$$$.A configuration of robbers issafeif no searchlight can see a robber (i.e. if there is no pair $$$i,j$$$ such that searchlight $$$j$$$ can see a robber $$$i$$$).What is the minimum number of moves you need to perform to reach a safe configuration?InputThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, m \\\\leq 2000$$$): the number of robbers and the number of searchlight.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i, b_i \\\\leq 10^6$$$), coordinates of robbers.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$c_i$$$, $$$d_i$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq c_i, d_i \\\\leq 10^6$$$), coordinates of searchlights.OutputPrint one integer: the minimum number of moves you need to perform to reach a safe configuration.ExamplesInput1 1 0 0 2 3Output3Input2 3 1 6 6 1 10 1 1 10 7 7Output4Input1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0Output1Input7 3 0 8 3 8 2 7 0 10 5 5 7 0 3 5 6 6 3 11 11 5Output6NoteIn the first test, you can move each robber to the right three times. After that there will be one robber in the coordinates $$$(3, 0)$$$.The configuration of the robbers is safe, because the only searchlight can't see the robber, because it is in the coordinates $$$(2, 3)$$$ and $$$3 > 2$$$.In the second test, you can move each robber to the right two times and two times up. After that robbers will be in the coordinates $$$(3, 8)$$$, $$$(8, 3)$$$.It's easy the see that the configuration of the robbers is safe.It can be proved that you can't reach a safe configuration using no more than $$$3$$$ moves.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "14655ca4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ robbers at coordinates $(a_1, b_1)$, $(a_2, b_2)$, ..., $(a_n, b_n)$ and $m$ searchlights at coordinates $(c_1, d_1)$, $(c_2, d_2)$, ..., $(c_m, d_m)$.\n\nYou can move all robbers either one unit to the right (increasing $a_i$ for all $i$) or one unit up (increasing $b_i$ for all $i$).\n\nA searchlight $j$ can see a robber $i$ if $a_i \\leq c_j$ and $b_i \\leq d_j$.\n\nA configuration of robbers is safe if no searchlight can see any robber.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of moves you need to make to reach a safe configuration?"}, {"prompt_md5": "46b8d975", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You have a number of people and a number of spotlights.
