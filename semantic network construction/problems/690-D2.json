The Wall (medium)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputHeidi the Cow is aghast: cracks in the northern Wall? Zombies gathering outside, forming groups, preparing their assault? This must not happen! Quickly, she fetches her HC2(Handbook of Crazy Constructions) and looks for the right chapter:How to build a wall:Take a set of bricks.Select one of the possible wall designs. Computing the number of possible designs is left as an exercise to the reader.Place bricks on top of each other, according to the chosen design.This seems easy enough. But Heidi is a Coding Cow, not a Constructing Cow. Her mind keeps coming back to point 2b. Despite the imminent danger of a zombie onslaught, she wonders just how many possible walls she could build with up tonbricks.Awallis a set of wall segments as defined in the easy version. How many different walls can be constructed such that the wall consists of at least1and at mostnbricks? Two walls are different if there exist a columncand a rowrsuch that one wall has a brick in this spot, and the other does not.Along withn, you will be givenC, the width of the wall (as defined in the easy version). Return the number of different walls modulo106+ 3.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersnandC,1 ≤n≤ 500000,1 ≤C≤ 200000.OutputPrint the number of different walls that Heidi could build, modulo106+ 3.ExamplesInput5 1Output5Input2 2Output5Input3 2Output9Input11 5Output4367Input37 63Output230574NoteThe number106+ 3is prime.In the second sample case, the five walls are:B        BB., .B, BB, B., and .BIn the third sample case, the nine walls are the five as in the second sample case and in addition the following four:B    BB    B  B        BB., .B, BB, and BB", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "752a1e87", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers, $n$ and $C$.  \n\n* $n$ represents the maximum number of bricks you can use to build a wall.\n* $C$ represents the width of the wall.\n\nYou need to find the number of different walls you can build using these bricks, where:\n\n* Each wall must have at least 1 brick and at most $n$ bricks.\n* Two walls are considered different if they have a brick in a different position.\n\nThe answer should be the number of different walls modulo $10^6 + 3$."}, {"prompt_md5": "e82462c0", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a number of items (n) and a width (C).
