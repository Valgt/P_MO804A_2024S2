Mathematical Additiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIvan decided to prepare for the test on solving integer equations. He noticed that all tasks in the test have the following form:You are given two positive integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, find any pair of integers (not necessarily positive) $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, such that: $$$$$$\\\\frac{x}{u} + \\\\frac{y}{v} = \\\\frac{x + y}{u + v}.$$$$$$The solution $$$x = 0$$$, $$$y = 0$$$ is forbidden, so you should find any solution with $$$(x, y) \\\\neq (0, 0)$$$.Please help Ivan to solve some equations of this form.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq u, v \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the parameters of the equation.OutputFor each test case print two integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ — a possible solution to the equation. It should be satisfied that $$$-10^{18} \\\\leq x, y \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$ and $$$(x, y) \\\\neq (0, 0)$$$.We can show that an answer always exists. If there are multiple possible solutions you can print any.ExampleInput4 1 1 2 3 3 5 6 9Output-1 1 -4 9 -18 50 -4 9NoteIn the first test case: $$$\\\\frac{-1}{1} + \\\\frac{1}{1} = 0 = \\\\frac{-1 + 1}{1 + 1}$$$.In the second test case: $$$\\\\frac{-4}{2} + \\\\frac{9}{3} = 1 = \\\\frac{-4 + 9}{2 + 3}$$$.In the third test case: $$$\\\\frac{-18}{3} + \\\\frac{50}{5} = 4 = \\\\frac{-18 + 50}{3 + 5}$$$.In the fourth test case: $$$\\\\frac{-4}{6} + \\\\frac{9}{9} = \\\\frac{1}{3} = \\\\frac{-4 + 9}{6 + 9}$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0956e2b5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given two positive integers $u$ and $v$, find any pair of integers $x$ and $y$ (not necessarily positive) that satisfy the following equation:\n\n$$\\frac{x}{u} + \\frac{y}{v} = \\frac{x + y}{u + v}$$\n\nThe solution $x = 0$, $y = 0$ is not allowed.  \n\nYou can assume that a solution always exists.
