Neverending competitionstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are literally dozens of snooker competitions held each year, and team Jinotega tries to attend them all (for some reason they prefer name \"snookah\")! When a competition takes place somewhere far from their hometown, Ivan, Artsem and Konstantin take a flight to the contest and back.Jinotega's best friends, team Base have found a list of their itinerary receipts with information about departure and arrival airports. Now they wonder, where is Jinotega now: at home or at some competition far away? They know that:this list contains all Jinotega's flights in this year (in arbitrary order),Jinotega has only flown from his hometown to a snooker contest and back,after each competition Jinotega flies back home (though they may attend a competition in one place several times),and finally, at the beginning of the year Jinotega was at home.Please help them to determine Jinotega's location!InputIn the first line of input there is a single integern: the number of Jinotega's flights (1 ≤n≤ 100). In the second line there is a string of3capital Latin letters: the name of Jinotega's home airport. In the nextnlines there is flight information, one flight per line, in form \"XXX->YYY\", where \"XXX\" is the name of departure airport \"YYY\" is the name of arrival airport. Exactly one of these airports is Jinotega's home airport.It is guaranteed that flights information is consistent with the knowledge of Jinotega's friends, which is described in the main part of the statement.OutputIf Jinotega is now at home, print \"home\" (without quotes), otherwise print \"contest\".ExamplesInput4SVOSVO->CDGLHR->SVOSVO->LHRCDG->SVOOutputhomeInput3SVOSVO->HKTHKT->SVOSVO->RAPOutputcontestNoteIn the first sample Jinotega might first fly from SVO to CDG and back, and then from SVO to LHR and back, so now they should be at home.
