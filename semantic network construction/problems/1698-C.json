The array is called3SUM-closedif for all distinct indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$, the sum $$$a_i + a_j + a_k$$$ is an element of the array. More formally, $$$a$$$ is 3SUM-closed if for all integers $$$1 \\\\leq i < j < k \\\\leq n$$$, there exists some integer $$$1 \\\\leq l \\\\leq n$$$ such that $$$a_i + a_j + a_k = a_l$$$.Determine if $$$a$$$ is 3SUM-closed.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if $$$a$$$ is 3SUM-closed and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.You can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yEs\", \"yes\" and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput43-1 0 151 -2 -2 1 -360 0 0 0 0 04-1 2 -3 4OutputYES NO YES NONoteIn the first test case, there is only one triple where $$$i=1$$$, $$$j=2$$$, $$$k=3$$$. In this case, $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 0$$$, which is an element of the array ($$$a_2 = 0$$$), so the array is 3SUM-closed.In the second test case, $$$a_1 + a_4 + a_5 = -1$$$, which is not an element of the array. Therefore, the array is not 3SUM-closed.In the third test case, $$$a_i + a_j + a_k = 0$$$ for all distinct $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$0$$$ is an element of the array, so the array is 3SUM-closed.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b4b7e53f", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a list of numbers, determine if for any three distinct numbers in the list, their sum is also in the list."}, {"prompt_md5": "51c7a80b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
