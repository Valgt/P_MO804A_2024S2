You have a graph, and you want to find a long cycle and a huge independent set, just because you can. But for now, let's just stick with finding either.Given a connected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices, you can choose to either:find an independent set that hasexactly$$$\\\\lceil\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\rceil$$$ vertices.find asimplecycle of lengthat least$$$\\\\lceil\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\rceil$$$.An independent set is a set of vertices such that no two of them are connected by an edge. A simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice. I have a proof you can always solve one of these problems, but it's too long to fit this margin.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$5 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$n-1 \\\\le m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two space-separated integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u,v \\\\le n$$$) that mean there's an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It's guaranteed that the graph is connected and doesn't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.OutputIf you choose to solve the first problem, then on the first line print \"1\", followed by a line containing $$$\\\\lceil\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\rceil$$$ distinct integers not exceeding $$$n$$$, the vertices in the desired independent set.If you, however, choose to solve the second problem, then on the first line print \"2\", followed by a line containing one integer, $$$c$$$, representing the length of the found cycle, followed by a line containing $$$c$$$ distinct integers integers not exceeding $$$n$$$, the vertices in the desired cycle,in the order they appear in the cycle.ExamplesInput6 6 1 3 3 4 4 2 2 6 5 6 5 1Output1 1 6 4Input6 8 1 3 3 4 4 2 2 6 5 6 5 1 1 4 2 5Output2 4 1 5 2 4Input5 4 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5Output1 3 4 5NoteIn the first sample:Notice that you can solve either problem, so printing the cycle $$$2-4-3-1-5-6$$$ is also acceptable.In the second sample:Notice that if there are multiple answers you can print any, so printing the cycle $$$2-5-6$$$, for example, is acceptable.In the third sample:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "058ac898", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.  \n\nYou need to find either:\n\n1.
