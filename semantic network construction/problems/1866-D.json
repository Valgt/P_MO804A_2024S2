Given an integer $$$K$$$. Chaneka will do $$$M-K+1$$$ operations. In the $$$p$$$-th operation, Chaneka does the following procedure:Choose any array. Let's say Chaneka chooses the $$$x$$$-th array.Choose an index $$$y$$$ in that array such that $$$p \\\\leq y \\\\leq p+K-1$$$.Add the value of $$$A_{x, y}$$$ to the total money in the wallet.Change the value of $$$A_{x, y}$$$ into $$$0$$$.Determine the maximum total money that can be earned!InputThe first line contains three integers $$$N$$$, $$$M$$$, and $$$K$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 10$$$; $$$1 \\\\leq M \\\\leq 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\leq K \\\\leq \\\\min(10, M)$$$) — the number of arrays, the size of each array, and the constant that describes the operation constraints.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$N$$$ lines contains $$$M$$$ integers $$$A_{i,1}, A_{i,2}, \\\\ldots, A_{i,M}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq A_{i,j} \\\\leq 10^6$$$) — the elements of the $$$i$$$-th array.OutputOutput an integer representing the maximum total money that can be earned.ExamplesInput3 3 1 10 4 2 8 1 9 4 8 2Output27Input3 3 2 5 9 4 1 3 1 2 8 7Output17Input3 4 3 5 9 10 1 1 3 1 5 2 5 7 2Output19NoteIn the first example, the following is a sequence of operations of one optimal strategy:Choosing element $$$A_{1, 1}$$$ with a value of $$$10$$$.Choosing element $$$A_{3, 2}$$$ with a value of $$$8$$$.Choosing element $$$A_{2, 3}$$$ with a value of $$$9$$$.So the total money earned is $$$10+8+9=27$$$.In the second example, the following is a sequence of operations of one optimal strategy:Choosing element $$$A_{3, 2}$$$ with a value of $$$8$$$.Choosing element $$$A_{1, 2}$$$ with a value of $$$9$$$.So the total money earned is $$$8+9=17$$$.In the third example, the following is a sequence of operations of one optimal strategy:Choosing element $$$A_{1, 3}$$$ with a value of $$$10$$$.Choosing element $$$A_{1, 2}$$$ with a value of $$$9$$$.So the total money earned is $$$10+9=19$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9b6ff6e4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $N$ arrays, each with $M$ positive integers.
