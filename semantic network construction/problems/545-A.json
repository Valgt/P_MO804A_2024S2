Toy Carstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLittle Susie, thanks to her older brother, likes to play with cars. Today she decided to set up a tournament between them. The process of a tournament is described in the next paragraph.There arentoy cars. Each pair collides. The result of a collision can be one of the following: no car turned over, one car turned over, both cars turned over. A car is good if it turned over in no collision. The results of the collisions are determined by ann×nmatrixА: there is a number on the intersection of theі-th row andj-th column that describes the result of the collision of theі-th and thej-th car:- 1: if this pair of cars never collided.- 1occurs only on the main diagonal of the matrix.0: if no car turned over during the collision.1: if only thei-th car turned over during the collision.2: if only thej-th car turned over during the collision.3: if both cars turned over during the collision.Susie wants to find all the good cars. She quickly determined which cars are good. Can you cope with the task?InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the number of cars.Each of the nextnlines containsnspace-separated integers that determine matrixA.It is guaranteed that on the main diagonal there are- 1, and- 1doesn't appear anywhere else in the matrix.It is guaranteed that the input is correct, that is, ifAij= 1, thenAji= 2, ifAij= 3, thenAji= 3, and ifAij= 0, thenAji= 0.OutputPrint the number of good cars and in the next line print their space-separated indices in the increasing order.ExamplesInput3-1 0 00 -1 10 2 -1Output21 3Input4-1 3 3 33 -1 3 33 3 -1 33 3 3 -1Output0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5ca5a45e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ where:\n\n*  $A_{ii} = -1$ for all $i$ (the diagonal elements are -1).\n*  $A_{ij}$ represents the outcome of a collision between car $i$ and car $j$:\n    * $A_{ij} = 0$ if no cars turn over.\n    * $A_{ij} = 1$ if only car $i$ turns over.\n    * $A_{ij} = 2$ if only car $j$ turns over.\n    * $A_{ij} = 3$ if both cars turn over.\n\nA car is considered \"good\" if it does not turn over in any collision.\n\nDetermine the number of good cars and list their indices in increasing order."}, {"prompt_md5": "cd9bbd54", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a square matrix representing the outcome of collisions between pairs of objects.
