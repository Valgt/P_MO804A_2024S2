Equalizing Two Stringstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ both of length $$$n$$$ and both consisting of lowercase Latin letters.In one move, you can choose any length $$$len$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and perform the following operation:Choose any contiguous substring of the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$len$$$ and reverse it;at the same timechoose any contiguous substring of the string $$$t$$$ of length $$$len$$$ and reverse it as well.Note that during one move you reverseexactly onesubstring of the string $$$s$$$ andexactly onesubstring of the string $$$t$$$.Also note that borders of substrings you reverse in $$$s$$$ and in $$$t$$$can be different, the only restriction is that you reverse the substrings of equal length. For example, if $$$len=3$$$ and $$$n=5$$$, you can reverse $$$s[1 \\\\dots 3]$$$ and $$$t[3 \\\\dots 5]$$$, $$$s[2 \\\\dots 4]$$$ and $$$t[2 \\\\dots 4]$$$, but not $$$s[1 \\\\dots 3]$$$ and $$$t[1 \\\\dots 2]$$$.Your task is to say if it is possible to make strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ equal after some (possibly, empty) sequence of moves.You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$q$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$.The second line of the test case contains one string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters.The third line of the test case contains one string $$$t$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer on it — \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to make strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ equal after some (possibly, empty) sequence of moves and \"NO\" otherwise.ExampleInput4 4 abcd abdc 5 ababa baaba 4 asdf asdg 4 abcd badcOutputNO YES NO YES", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c138dbcc", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two strings,  *s* and *t*, both of length *n*.
