(You are allowed to make values of array negative).InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^{15}$$$) — the size of array $$$a$$$ and upper bound on its sum.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the array itself.It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of steps to make $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{a_i} \\\\le k$$$.ExampleInput4 1 10 20 2 69 6 9 7 8 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 10 1 1 2 3 1 2 6 1 6 8 10Output10 0 2 7NoteIn the first test case, you should decrease $$$a_1$$$ $$$10$$$ times to get the sum lower or equal to $$$k = 10$$$.In the second test case, the sum of array $$$a$$$ is already less or equal to $$$69$$$, so you don't need to change it.In the third test case, you can, for example:set $$$a_4 = a_3 = 1$$$;decrease $$$a_4$$$ by one, and get $$$a_4 = 0$$$.As a result, you'll get array $$$[1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1]$$$ with sum less or equal to $$$8$$$ in $$$1 + 1 = 2$$$ steps.In the fourth test case, you can, for example:choose $$$a_7$$$ and decrease in by one $$$3$$$ times; you'll get $$$a_7 = -2$$$;choose $$$4$$$ elements $$$a_6$$$, $$$a_8$$$, $$$a_9$$$ and $$$a_{10}$$$ and them equal to $$$a_7 = -2$$$.As a result, you'll get array $$$[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2]$$$ with sum less or equal to $$$1$$$ in $$$3 + 4 = 7$$$ steps.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ea40b3a4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and an integer $k$.
