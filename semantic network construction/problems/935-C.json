Fifa and Fafatime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFifa and Fafa are sharing a flat. Fifa loves video games and wants to download a new soccer game. Unfortunately, Fafa heavily uses the internet which consumes the quota. Fifa can access the internet through his Wi-Fi access point. This access point can be accessed within a range ofrmeters (this range can be chosen by Fifa) from its position. Fifa must put the access point inside the flat which has a circular shape of radiusR. Fifa wants to minimize the area that is not covered by the access point inside the flat without letting Fafa or anyone outside the flat to get access to the internet.The world is represented as an infinite 2D plane. The flat is centered at(x1,y1)and has radiusRand Fafa's laptop is located at(x2,y2), not necessarily inside the flat. Find the position and the radius chosen by Fifa for his access point which minimizes the uncovered area.InputThe single line of the input contains 5 space-separated integersR,x1,y1,x2,y2(1 ≤R≤ 105,|x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| ≤ 105).OutputPrint three space-separated numbersxap,yap,rwhere(xap,yap)is the position which Fifa chose for the access point andris the radius of its range.Your answer will be considered correct if the radius does not differ from optimal more than10- 6absolutely or relatively, and also the radius you printed can be changed by no more than10- 6(absolutely or relatively) in such a way that all points outside the flat and Fafa's laptop position are outside circle of the access point range.ExamplesInput5 3 3 1 1Output3.7677669529663684 3.7677669529663684 3.914213562373095Input10 5 5 5 15Output5.0 5.0 10.0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9129193d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "A circular room has a radius of $R$.
