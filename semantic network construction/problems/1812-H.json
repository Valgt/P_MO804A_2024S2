Expected Twisttime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problem.There is an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers hidden from you. Your task is to find the smallest element of the array.To do this, you can ask several queries. In each query, you can pick two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq l \\\\leq r \\\\leq n$$$). In return, you will be given the value of $$$\\\\max(a_l, a_{l+1}, \\\\dots, a_r)$$$. In other words, you will be told themaximumvalue of the subarray from $$$a_l$$$ to $$$a_r$$$.Find the minimum of the array. You can ask at most $$$\\\\mathbf{624}$$$ queries.It is guaranteed that the values $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ are chosen uniformly at random between $$$0$$$ and $$$2^{32}-1$$$ (inclusive).InteractionBegin the interaction by reading an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^4$$$) on a separate line.To ask a query, print a line in the form $$$\\\\texttt{?}\\\\;\\\\;l\\\\;\\\\;r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$). Then you should read a single line containing the answer to your query.After you have determined the answer, print a line in the form $$$\\\\texttt{!}\\\\;\\\\;x$$$ where $$$x$$$ is the minimum value.After printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will getIdleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:fflush(stdout)orcout.flush()in C++;System.out.flush()in Java;flush(output)in Pascal;stdout.flush()in Python;see the documentation for other languages.Answer $$$\\\\texttt{-1}$$$ means that you made an invalid query. Exit immediately after receiving $$$\\\\texttt{-1}$$$ and you will seeWrong answerverdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.ExampleInput3  1295320727  984617979  1295320727  167316954Output? 1 3  ? 1 1  ? 2 2  ? 3 3  ! 167316954", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "57fafba5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
