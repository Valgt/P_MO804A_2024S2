Closest Pointtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputConsider a set of points on a line. The distance between two points $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ is $$$|i - j|$$$.The point $$$i$$$ from the set isthe closestto the point $$$j$$$ from the set, if there is no other point $$$k$$$ in the set such that the distance from $$$j$$$ to $$$k$$$ isstrictly lessthan the distance from $$$j$$$ to $$$i$$$. In other words, all other points from the set have distance to $$$j$$$ greater or equal to $$$|i - j|$$$.For example, consider a set of points $$$\\\\{1, 3, 5, 8\\\\}$$$:for the point $$$1$$$, the closest point is $$$3$$$ (other points have distance greater than $$$|1-3| = 2$$$);for the point $$$3$$$, there are two closest points: $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$;for the point $$$5$$$, the closest point is $$$3$$$ (but not $$$8$$$, since its distance is greater than $$$|3-5|$$$);for the point $$$8$$$, the closest point is $$$5$$$.You are given a set of points. You have to add anintegerpoint into this set in such a way thatit is different from every existing point in the set, andit becomes the closest point to every point in the set. Is it possible?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines:the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 40$$$) — the number of points in the set;the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_1 < x_2 < \\\\dots < x_n \\\\le 100$$$) — the points from the set.OutputFor each test case, printYESif it is possible to add a new point according to the conditions from the statement. Otherwise, printNO.ExampleInput323 825 661 2 3 4 5 10OutputYES NO NONoteIn the first example, the point $$$7$$$ will be the closest to both $$$3$$$ and $$$8$$$.In the second example, it is impossible to add anintegerpoint so that it becomes the closest to both $$$5$$$ and $$$6$$$, and is different from both of them.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7142b75b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of distinct integers.
