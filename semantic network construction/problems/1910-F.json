Build Railway Stationstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp is playing a computer game where he's controlling an empire. An empire consists of $$$n$$$ cities, connected by $$$n - 1$$$ roads. The cities are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. It's possible to reach every city from every other one using the roads.Traversing every road takes $$$2$$$ hours. However, that can be improved. Monocarp can build railway stations in no more than $$$k$$$ cities. After they are built, allexistingroads that connect two cities with railway stations get converted to railroads and become $$$1$$$ hour to traverse.Let $$$f(x, y)$$$ be the total time it takes to traverse the roads on the shortest path between cities $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.Monocarp wants to build at most $$$k$$$ railway stations in such a way that the following value is minimized: $$$\\\\sum \\\\limits_{v=1}^{n} \\\\sum \\\\limits_{u=1}^{v-1} f(v, u)$$$ (the total time it takes to travel from every city to every other one). What the smallest value he can achieve?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of cities and the maximum number of railway stations Monocarp can build.Each of the following $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v, u \\\\le n$$$; $$$v \\\\neq u$$$) — a road that connects cities $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$.It's possible to reach every city from every other one using the roads. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print a single integer — the smallest total time it takes to travel from every city to every other one that Monocarp can achieve after building at most $$$k$$$ railway stations.ExampleInput35 21 22 33 44 54 41 21 31 45 31 21 32 42 5Output34 9 26", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "dfe6902d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a graph with $n$ cities and $n-1$ roads connecting them.
