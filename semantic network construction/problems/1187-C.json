Vasya And Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya has an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$.You don't know this array, but he told you $$$m$$$ facts about this array. The $$$i$$$-th fact is a triple of numbers $$$t_i$$$, $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le t_i \\\\le 1, 1 \\\\le l_i < r_i \\\\le n$$$) and it means:if $$$t_i=1$$$ then subbarray $$$a_{l_i}, a_{l_i + 1}, \\\\dots, a_{r_i}$$$ is sorted in non-decreasing order;if $$$t_i=0$$$ then subbarray $$$a_{l_i}, a_{l_i + 1}, \\\\dots, a_{r_i}$$$ is not sorted in non-decreasing order. A subarray is not sorted if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in this subarray such that the former is greater than the latter.For example if $$$a = [2, 1, 1, 3, 2]$$$ then he could give you three facts: $$$t_1=1, l_1=2, r_1=4$$$ (the subarray $$$[a_2, a_3, a_4] = [1, 1, 3]$$$ is sorted), $$$t_2=0, l_2=4, r_2=5$$$ (the subarray $$$[a_4, a_5] = [3, 2]$$$ is not sorted), and $$$t_3=0, l_3=3, r_3=5$$$ (the subarray $$$[a_3, a_5] = [1, 3, 2]$$$ is not sorted).You don't know the array $$$a$$$. Findanyarray which satisfies all the given facts.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000, 1 \\\\le m \\\\le 1000$$$).Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$t_i$$$, $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le t_i \\\\le 1, 1 \\\\le l_i < r_i \\\\le n$$$).If $$$t_i = 1$$$ then subbarray $$$a_{l_i}, a_{l_i + 1}, \\\\dots , a_{r_i}$$$ is sorted. Otherwise (if $$$t_i = 0$$$) subbarray $$$a_{l_i}, a_{l_i + 1}, \\\\dots , a_{r_i}$$$ is not sorted.OutputIf there is no array that satisfies these facts in only line printNO(in any letter case).If there is a solution, printYES(in any letter case). In second line print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) â€” the array $$$a$$$, satisfying all the given facts. If there are multiple satisfying arrays you can print any of them.ExamplesInput7 4 1 1 3 1 2 5 0 5 6 1 6 7OutputYES 1 2 2 3 5 4 4Input4 2 1 1 4 0 2 3OutputNO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7179e581", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$ and $m$ facts about an array of length $n$.
