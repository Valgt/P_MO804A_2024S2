Now he enjoys looking for his name everywhere. If he sees that he can obtain his name from some string by removing zero or more letters (at that, the remaining letters remain in the same order), he gets happy. For example, ifs=«aba», then strings «baobab», «aabbaa», «helloabahello» make him very happy and strings «aab», «baaa» and «helloabhello» do not.However rather than being happy once, he loves twice as much being happy twice! So, when he got stringtas a present, he wanted to cut it in two parts (the left part and the right part) so that each part made him happy.Helpsdetermine the number of distinct ways to cut the given stringtinto two parts in the required manner.InputThe first line contains strings, consisting of lowercase English letters. The length of stringsis from 1 to 1000 letters.The second line contains stringt, that also consists of lowercase English letters.
