Knitting Batiktime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMr. Chanek wants to knit a batik, a traditional cloth from Indonesia. The cloth forms a grid $$$a$$$ with size $$$n \\\\times m$$$. There are $$$k$$$ colors, and each cell in the grid can be one of the $$$k$$$ colors.Definea sub-rectangle as an ordered pair of two cells $$$((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2))$$$, denoting the top-left cell and bottom-right cell (inclusively) of a sub-rectangle in $$$a$$$. Two sub-rectangles $$$((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2))$$$ and $$$((x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4))$$$ have the same pattern if and only if the following holds:they have the same width ($$$x_2 - x_1 = x_4 - x_3$$$);they have the same height ($$$y_2 - y_1 = y_4 - y_3$$$);for every pair $$$(i, j)$$$ where $$$0 \\\\leq i \\\\leq x_2 - x_1$$$ and $$$0 \\\\leq j \\\\leq y_2 - y_1$$$, the color of cells $$$(x_1 + i, y_1 + j)$$$ and $$$(x_3 + i, y_3 + j)$$$ are equal.Count the number of possible batik color combinations, such that the subrectangles $$$((a_x, a_y),(a_x + r - 1, a_y + c - 1))$$$ and $$$((b_x, b_y),(b_x + r - 1, b_y + c - 1))$$$ have the same pattern.Output the answer modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.InputThe first line contains five integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, m \\\\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq r \\\\leq \\\\min(10^6, n)$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq c \\\\leq \\\\min(10^6, m)$$$) — the size of the batik, the number of colors, and size of the sub-rectangle.The second line contains four integers $$$a_x$$$, $$$a_y$$$, $$$b_x$$$, and $$$b_y$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_x, b_x \\\\leq n$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq a_y, b_y \\\\leq m$$$) — the top-left corners of the first and second sub-rectangle. Both of the sub-rectangles given are inside the grid ($$$1 \\\\leq a_x + r - 1$$$, $$$b_x + r - 1 \\\\leq n$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq a_y + c - 1$$$, $$$b_y + c - 1 \\\\leq m$$$).OutputOutput an integer denoting the number of possible batik color combinations modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExamplesInput3 3 2 2 2 1 1 2 2Output32Input4 5 170845 2 2 1 4 3 1Output756680455NoteThe following are all $$$32$$$ possible color combinations in the first example.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "34c81e80", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a grid of size $n \\times m$ that can have one of $k$ colors in each cell.  \n\nTwo sub-rectangles of the same size ($r \\times c$) are considered to have the same pattern if the colors in the corresponding cells are the same.\n\nYou need to find the number of different ways to color the entire grid so that two specific sub-rectangles, one at $(a_x, a_y)$ and the other at $(b_x, b_y)$, have the same pattern.\n\nOutput the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$."}, {"prompt_md5": "612d5054", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You have a grid of a given size.
