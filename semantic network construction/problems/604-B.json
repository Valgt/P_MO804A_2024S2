More Cowbelltime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutKevin Sun wants to move his precious collection ofncowbells from Naperthrill to Exeter, where there is actually grass instead of corn. Before moving, he must pack his cowbells intokboxes of a fixed size. In order to keep his collection safe during transportation, he won't place more thantwocowbells into a single box. Since Kevin wishes to minimize expenses, he is curious about the smallest size box he can use to pack his entire collection.Kevin is a meticulous cowbell collector and knows that the size of hisi-th (1 ≤i≤n) cowbell is an integersi. In fact, he keeps his cowbells sorted by size, sosi- 1≤sifor anyi> 1. Also an expert packer, Kevin can fit one or two cowbells into a box of sizesif and only if the sum of their sizes does not exceeds. Given this information, help Kevin determine the smallestsfor which it is possible to put all of his cowbells intokboxes of sizes.InputThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 2·k≤ 100 000), denoting the number of cowbells and the number of boxes, respectively.The next line containsnspace-separated integerss1,s2, ...,sn(1 ≤s1≤s2≤ ... ≤sn≤ 1 000 000), the sizes of Kevin's cowbells. It is guaranteed that the sizessiare given in non-decreasing order.OutputPrint a single integer, the smallestsfor which it is possible for Kevin to put all of his cowbells intokboxes of sizes.ExamplesInput2 12 5Output7Input4 32 3 5 9Output9Input3 23 5 7Output8NoteIn the first sample, Kevin must pack his two cowbells into the same box.In the second sample, Kevin can pack together the following sets of cowbells:{2, 3},{5}and{9}.In the third sample, the optimal solution is{3, 5}and{7}.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ffd52dcf", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$ representing the sizes of cowbells.
