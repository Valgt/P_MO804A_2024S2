Nearest vectorstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given the set of vectors on the plane, each of them starting at the origin. Your task is to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them.Non-oriented angle is non-negative value, minimal between clockwise and counterclockwise direction angles. Non-oriented angle is always between0andπ. For example, opposite directions vectors have angle equals toπ.InputFirst line of the input contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 100 000) — the number of vectors.Thei-th of the followingnlines contains two integersxiandyi(|x|, |y| ≤ 10 000,x2+y2> 0) — the coordinates of thei-th vector. Vectors are numbered from1tonin order of appearing in the input. It is guaranteed that no two vectors in the input share the same direction (but they still can have opposite directions).OutputPrint two integer numbersaandb(a≠b) — a pair of indices of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle.
