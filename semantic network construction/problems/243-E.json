That is, each row of the matrix looks like that00...0011...1100...00(or simply consists of zeroes if it has no ones).You are given matrixaof sizen×n, consisting of zeroes and ones. Your task is to determine whether you can get a good matrixbfrom it by rearranging the columns or not.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 500) — the size of matrixa.Each ofnfollowing lines containsncharacters \"0\" and \"1\" — matrixa. Note that the characters are written without separators.OutputPrint \"YES\" in the first line, if you can rearrange the matrix columns so as to get a good matrixb. In the nextnlines print the good matrixb. If there are multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them.If it is impossible to get a good matrix, print \"NO\".ExamplesInput6100010110110011001010010000100011001OutputYES011000111100000111001100100000000111Input3110101011OutputNO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e3e3b580", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a grid of 0s and 1s.
