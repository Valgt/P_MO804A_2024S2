Painting the Fencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a long fence which consists of $$$n$$$ sections. Unfortunately, it is not painted, so you decided to hire $$$q$$$ painters to paint it. $$$i$$$-th painter will paint all sections $$$x$$$ such that $$$l_i \\\\le x \\\\le r_i$$$.Unfortunately, you are on a tight budget, so you may hire only $$$q - 2$$$ painters. Obviously, only painters you hire will do their work.You want to maximize the number of painted sections if you choose $$$q - 2$$$ painters optimally. A section is considered painted if at least one painter paints it.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n, q \\\\le 5000$$$) — the number of sections and the number of painters availible for hire, respectively.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, each describing one of the painters: $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le n$$$).OutputPrint one integer — maximum number of painted sections if you hire $$$q - 2$$$ painters.ExamplesInput7 5 1 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 3 5Output7Input4 3 1 1 2 2 3 4Output2Input4 4 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 4Output3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a2147a07", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have a fence with $n$ sections.
