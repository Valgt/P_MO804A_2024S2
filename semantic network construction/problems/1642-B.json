He decided to create a team with some of his children to play \"brawl:go 2\".Sam has $$$n$$$ power-ups, the $$$i$$$-th has type $$$a_i$$$. A child's strength is equal to the number ofdifferenttypes among power-ups he has.For a team of size $$$k$$$, Sam will distribute all $$$n$$$ power-ups to $$$k$$$ children in such a way that each of the $$$k$$$ children receives at least one power-up, and each power-up is given to someone.For each integer $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, find theminimumsum of strengths of a team of $$$k$$$ children Sam can get.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — types of Sam's power-ups.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor every test case print $$$n$$$ integers.The $$$k$$$-th integer should be equal to the minimum sum of strengths of children in the team of size $$$k$$$ that Sam can get.ExampleInput231 1 265 1 2 2 2 4Output2 2 3  4 4 4 4 5 6NoteOne of the ways to give power-ups to minimise the sum of strengths in the first test case:$$$k = 1: \\\\{1, 1, 2\\\\}$$$$$$k = 2: \\\\{1, 1\\\\}, \\\\{2\\\\}$$$$$$k = 3: \\\\{1\\\\}, \\\\{1\\\\}, \\\\{2\\\\}$$$One of the ways to give power-ups to minimise the sum of strengths in the second test case:$$$k = 1: \\\\{1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 5\\\\}$$$$$$k = 2: \\\\{2, 2, 2, 4, 5\\\\}, \\\\{1\\\\}$$$$$$k = 3: \\\\{2, 2, 2, 5\\\\}, \\\\{1\\\\}, \\\\{4\\\\}$$$$$$k = 4: \\\\{2, 2, 2\\\\}, \\\\{1\\\\}, \\\\{4\\\\}, \\\\{5\\\\}$$$$$$k = 5: \\\\{2, 2\\\\}, \\\\{1\\\\}, \\\\{2\\\\}, \\\\{4\\\\}, \\\\{5\\\\}$$$$$$k = 6: \\\\{1\\\\}, \\\\{2\\\\}, \\\\{2\\\\}, \\\\{2\\\\}, \\\\{4\\\\}, \\\\{5\\\\}$$$", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5ec7963e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ power-ups, each with a unique type represented by an integer $a_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$).
