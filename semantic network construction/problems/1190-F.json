Tokitsukaze and Powerstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTokitsukaze is playing a room escape game designed by SkywalkerT. In this game, she needs to find out hidden clues in the room to reveal a way to escape.After a while, she realizes that the only way to run away is to open the digital door lock since she accidentally went into a secret compartment and found some clues, which can be interpreted as:Only when you enter $$$n$$$ possible different passwords can you open the door;Passwords must be integers ranged from $$$0$$$ to $$$(m - 1)$$$;A password cannot be $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq x < m$$$) if $$$x$$$ and $$$m$$$ are notcoprime(i.e. $$$x$$$ and $$$m$$$ have some common divisor greater than $$$1$$$);A password cannot be $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq x < m$$$) if there existnon-negativeintegers $$$e$$$ and $$$k$$$ such that $$$p^e = k m + x$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a secret integer;Any integer that doesn't break the above rules can be a password;Several integers are hidden in the room, but only one of them can be $$$p$$$.Fortunately, she finds that $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ are recorded in the lock. However, what makes Tokitsukaze frustrated is that she doesn't do well in math. Now that she has found an integer that is suspected to be $$$p$$$, she wants you to help her find out $$$n$$$ possible passwords, or determine the integer cannot be $$$p$$$.InputThe only line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 5 \\\\times 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq p < m \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$).It is guaranteed that $$$m$$$ isa positive integer power of a single prime number.OutputIf the number of possible different passwords is less than $$$n$$$, print a single integer $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, print $$$n$$$ distinct integers ranged from $$$0$$$ to $$$(m - 1)$$$ as passwords. You can print these integers in any order. Besides, if there are multiple solutions, print any.ExamplesInput1 2 1Output-1Input3 5 1Output2 4 3Input2 5 4Output2 3Input4 9 8Output2 4 7 5NoteIn the first example, there is no possible password.In each of the last three examples, the given integer $$$n$$$ equals to the number of possible different passwords for the given integers $$$m$$$ and $$$p$$$, so if the order of numbers in the output is ignored, the solution is unique as shown above.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "3f93f1ca", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given three integers $n$, $m$, and $p$. \n\n* $n$ is the number of passwords you need to find.\n* $m$ is a positive integer that is a power of a single prime number.\n* $p$ is a potential secret integer.\n\nYou need to find $n$ different passwords that meet the following criteria:\n\n1.
