Let's call that representationprairie partitionofx.For example, the prairie partitions of12,17,7and1are:12 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5,17 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 2,7 = 1 + 2 + 4,1 = 1.Alice took a sequence of positive integers (possibly with repeating elements), replaced every element with the sequence of summands in its prairie partition, arranged the resulting numbers in non-decreasing order and gave them to Borys. Now Borys wonders how many elements Alice's original sequence could contain.
