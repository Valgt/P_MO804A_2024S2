Remembering Stringstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have multiset ofnstrings of the same length, consisting of lowercase English letters. We will say that those strings are easy to remember if for each string there is some positioniand some lettercof the English alphabet, such that this string is the only string in the multiset that has lettercin positioni.For example, a multiset of strings {\"abc\", \"aba\", \"adc\", \"ada\"} are not easy to remember. And multiset {\"abc\", \"ada\", \"ssa\"} is easy to remember because:the first string is the only string that has charactercin position3;the second string is the only string that has characterdin position2;the third string is the only string that has charactersin position2.You want to change your multiset a little so that it is easy to remember. Foraijcoins, you can change character in thej-th position of thei-th string into any other lowercase letter of the English alphabet. Find what is the minimum sum you should pay in order to make the multiset of strings easy to remember.InputThe first line contains two integersn,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 20) — the number of strings in the multiset and the length of the strings respectively. Nextnlines contain the strings of the multiset, consisting only of lowercase English letters, each string's length ism.Nextnlines containmintegers each, thei-th of them contains integersai1,ai2, ...,aim(0 ≤aij≤ 106).OutputPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput4 5abcdeabcdeabcdeabcde1 1 1 1 11 1 1 1 11 1 1 1 11 1 1 1 1Output3Input4 3abcabaadcada10 10 1010 1 1010 10 1010 1 10Output2Input3 3abcadassa1 1 11 1 11 1 1Output0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f4d38027", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of $n$ strings, each of length $m$.
