Roma and Lucky Numberstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutRoma (a popular Russian name that means 'Roman') loves the Little Lvov Elephant's lucky numbers.Let us remind you that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation only contains lucky digits4and7. For example, numbers47,744,4are lucky and5,17,467are not.Roma's gotnpositive integers. He wonders, how many of those integers have not more thanklucky digits? Help him, write the program that solves the problem.InputThe first line contains two integersn,k(1 ≤n,k≤ 100). The second line containsnintegersai(1 ≤ai≤ 109)— the numbers that Roma has.The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.OutputIn a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput3 41 2 4Output3Input3 2447 44 77Output2NoteIn the first sample all numbers contain at most four lucky digits, so the answer is3.In the second sample number447doesn't fit in, as it contains more than two lucky digits. All other numbers are fine, so the answer is2.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "56621ce1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ integers.
