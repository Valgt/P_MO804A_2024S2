Minecrafttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAfter winning another Bed Wars game, Masha and Olya wanted to relax and decided to play a new game. Masha gives Olya an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a number $$$s$$$. Now Olya's task is to find a non-negative number $$$x$$$ such that $$$\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \\\\oplus x = s$$$. But she is very tired after a tight round, so please help her with this.But this task seemed too simple to them, so they decided to make the numbers larger (up to $$$2^k$$$) and provide you with their binary representation.InputEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, k, n \\\\cdot k \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^6$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the length of the binary representation of all numbers.The second line contains a string of length $$$k$$$, consisting of zeros and ones — the binary representation of the number $$$s$$$, starting from the most significant bits.The next $$$n$$$ lines also contain strings of length $$$k$$$, consisting of zeros and ones, the $$$i$$$-th of these strings contains the binary representation of the number $$$a_i$$$, starting from the most significant bits.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $$$n \\\\cdot k$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a string of length $$$k$$$ on a separate line, consisting of zeros or ones — the binary representation of any suitable number $$$x$$$ ($$$x \\\\ge 0$$$), starting from the most significant bits, or $$$-1$$$ if such $$$x$$$ does not exist.ExampleInput44 501011011100011001100011112 80010100110111111100111105 40101001000000000001000116 500011101101100101010111001001110000Output01110 10011010 0010 -1NoteIn the first test case, $$$s = 11, a = [14, 6, 12, 15]$$$, if $$$x = 14$$$, then $$$\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \\\\oplus x = (14 \\\\oplus 14) + (6 \\\\oplus 14) + (12 \\\\oplus 14) + (15 \\\\oplus 14) = 0 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 11 = s$$$.In the second test case, $$$s = 41, a = [191, 158]$$$, if $$$x = 154$$$, then $$$\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \\\\oplus x = (191 \\\\oplus 154) + (158 \\\\oplus 154) = 37 + 4 = 41 = s$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "43ada7fe", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers and a target number.
