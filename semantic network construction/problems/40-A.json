Find Colortime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutNot so long ago as a result of combat operations the main Berland place of interest — the magic clock — was damaged. The cannon's balls made several holes in the clock, that's why the residents are concerned about the repair. The magic clock can be represented as aninfiniteCartesian plane, where the origin corresponds to the clock center. The clock was painted two colors as is shown in the picture:The picture shows only the central part of the clock. This coloring naturally extends to infinity.The balls can be taken to be points on the plane. Your task is to find the color of the area, damaged by the given ball.All the points located on the border of one of the areas have to be considered painted black.InputThe first and single line contains two integersxandy— the coordinates of the hole made in the clock by the ball.
