Turtle and Three Sequencestime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPiggy gives Turtle three sequences $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$, $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n$$$, and $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_n$$$.Turtle will choose a subsequence of $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, n$$$ of length $$$m$$$, let it be $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_m$$$. The subsequence should satisfy the following conditions:$$$a_{p_1} \\\\le a_{p_2} \\\\le \\\\cdots \\\\le a_{p_m}$$$;All $$$b_{p_i}$$$ for all indices $$$i$$$ arepairwise distinct, i.e., there don't exist two different indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ such that $$$b_{p_i} = b_{p_j}$$$.Help him find the maximum value of $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i = 1}^m c_{p_i}$$$, or tell him that it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length $$$m$$$ that satisfies the conditions above.Recall that a sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3000$$$, $$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 5$$$) — the lengths of the three sequences and the required length of the subsequence.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$) — the elements of the sequence $$$a$$$.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le n$$$) — the elements of the sequence $$$b$$$.The fourth line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the elements of the sequence $$$c$$$.OutputOutput a single integer — the maximum value of $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i = 1}^m c_{p_i}$$$.

We can't choose $$$p = [2, 4]$$$ since $$$a_2 > a_4$$$, violating the first condition. We can't choose $$$p = [2, 3]$$$ either since $$$b_2 = b_3$$$, violating the second condition. We can choose $$$p = [1, 4]$$$, but $$$c_1 + c_4 = 4$$$, which isn't maximum.In the second example, we can choose $$$p = [4, 6, 7]$$$.In the third example, it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length $$$3$$$ that satisfies both of the conditions.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "bde2da1f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given three sequences of numbers: $a$, $b$, and $c$, each with $n$ elements.
