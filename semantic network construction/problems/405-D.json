Toy Sumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLittle Chris is very keen on his toy blocks. His teacher, however, wants Chris to solve more problems, so he decided to play a trick on Chris.There are exactlysblocks in Chris's set, each block has a unique number from 1 tos. Chris's teacher picks a subset of blocksXand keeps it to himself. He will give them back only if Chris can pick such a non-empty subsetYfrom the remaining blocks, that the equality holds:\"Are you kidding me?\", asks Chris.For example, consider a case wheres= 8and Chris's teacher took the blocks with numbers 1, 4 and 5. One way for Chris to choose a set is to pick the blocks with numbers 3 and 6, see figure. Then the required sums would be equal:(1 - 1) + (4 - 1) + (5 - 1) = (8 - 3) + (8 - 6) = 7.However, now Chris has exactlys= 106blocks. Given the setXof blocks his teacher chooses, help Chris to find the required setY!InputThe first line of input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 5·105), the number of blocks in the setX. The next line containsndistinct space-separated integersx1,x2,...,xn(1 ≤xi≤ 106), the numbers of the blocks inX.Note: since the size of the input and output could be very large, don't use slow output techniques in your language. For example, do not use input and output streams (cin, cout) in C++.OutputIn the first line of output print a single integerm(1 ≤m≤ 106-n), the number of blocks in the setY. In the next line outputmdistinct space-separated integersy1,y2,...,ym(1 ≤yi≤ 106), such that the required equality holds. The setsXandYshould not intersect, i.e.xi≠yjfor alli,j(1 ≤i≤n;1 ≤j≤m). It is guaranteed that at least one solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.ExamplesInput31 4 5Output2999993 1000000Input11Output11000000", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "634fb75d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of $n$ distinct numbers.
