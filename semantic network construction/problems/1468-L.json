A sequence ofprimeintegers $$$P = [p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_k]$$$ is calledsuitablefor the sequence $$$A$$$ if $$$a_1$$$ is divisible by $$$p_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$ is divisible by $$$p_2$$$ and so on.A sequence ofprimeintegers $$$P$$$ is calledfriendlyif there are no unique integers in this sequence.A sequence $$$A$$$ is calledideal, if each sequence $$$P$$$ that issuitablefor $$$A$$$ isfriendlyas well (i. e. there is no sequence $$$P$$$ that issuitablefor $$$A$$$, but notfriendly). For example, the sequence $$$[2, 4, 16]$$$ isideal, while the sequence $$$[2, 4, 6]$$$ is notideal(there exists a sequence $$$P = [2, 2, 3]$$$ which issuitablefor $$$A$$$, but notfriendly).You are given $$$n$$$ different integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, ..., $$$x_n$$$. You have to chooseexactly$$$k$$$ of them in such a way that they form anidealsequence, or report that it is impossible. Note that no integer can be chosen more than once.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1000$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ pairwise distinct integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, ..., $$$x_n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq x_i \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$).OutputIf it is impossible to choose exactly $$$k$$$ integers from $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, ..., $$$x_n$$$ in such a way that the chosen integers form anidealsequence, print $$$0$$$.Otherwise, print $$$k$$$ pairwise distinct integers — the elements of the chosenidealsequence. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput3 32 4 6Output0Input3 32 4 16Output2 4 16Input4 32 4 6 16Output2 4 16", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f68360aa", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a set of numbers.
