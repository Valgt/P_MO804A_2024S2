The Pleasant Walktime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ houses along the road where Anya lives, each one is painted in one of $$$k$$$ possible colors.Anya likes walking along this road, but she doesn't like when two adjacent houses at the road have the same color. She wants to select a long segment of the road such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.Help Anya find the longest segment with this property.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ — the number of houses and the number of colors ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$).The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ — the colors of the houses along the road ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le k$$$).OutputOutput a single integer — the maximum number of houses on the road segment having no two adjacent houses of the same color.ExampleInput8 3 1 2 3 3 2 1 2 2Output4NoteIn the example, the longest segment without neighboring houses of the same color is from the house 4 to the house 7. The colors of the houses are $$$[3, 2, 1, 2]$$$ and its length is 4 houses.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "989daa46", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ integers, where each integer represents the color of a house.
