Game 23time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp plays \"Game 23\". Initially he has a number $$$n$$$ and his goal is to transform it to $$$m$$$. In one move, he can multiply $$$n$$$ by $$$2$$$ or multiply $$$n$$$ by $$$3$$$. He can perform any number of moves.Print the number of moves needed to transform $$$n$$$ to $$$m$$$. Print-1if it is impossible to do so.It is easy to prove that any way to transform $$$n$$$ to $$$m$$$ contains the same number of moves (i.e. number of moves doesn't depend on the way of transformation).InputThe only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le m \\\\le 5\\\\cdot10^8$$$).OutputPrint the number of moves to transform $$$n$$$ to $$$m$$$, or-1if there is no solution.ExamplesInput120 51840Output7Input42 42Output0Input48 72Output-1NoteIn the first example, the possible sequence of moves is: $$$120 \\\\rightarrow 240 \\\\rightarrow 720 \\\\rightarrow 1440 \\\\rightarrow 4320 \\\\rightarrow 12960 \\\\rightarrow 25920 \\\\rightarrow 51840.$$$ The are $$$7$$$ steps in total.In the second example, no moves are needed. Thus, the answer is $$$0$$$.In the third example, it is impossible to transform $$$48$$$ to $$$72$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4eb7ae2d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two numbers, $n$ and $m$.
