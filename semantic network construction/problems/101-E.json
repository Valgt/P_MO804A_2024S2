Candies and Stonestime limit per test7.5 secondsmemory limit per test45 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLittle Gerald and his coach Mike play an interesting game. At the beginning of the game there is a pile consisting ofncandies and a pile consisting ofmstones. Gerald and Mike move in turns, Mike goes first. During his move Mike checks how many candies and stones Gerald has eaten. Let Gerald eatacandies andbstones. Then Mike awards Geraldf(a,b)prize points. Gerald during his move either eats a candy from the pile of candies or a stone from the pile of stones. As Mike sees that Gerald has eaten everything apart one candy and one stone, he awards points for the last time and the game ends. Gerald is not allowed to eat all the candies, and he is not allowed to eat all the stones too. Tell Gerald how to play to get the largest possible number of points: it is required to find one of the possible optimal playing strategies for Gerald.InputThe first line contains three integersn,m,p(1 ≤n,m≤ 20000,1 ≤p≤ 109).

The value off(a,b)is calculated as a remainder of the division of the sumxa+ybby numberp.OutputPrint on the first line the only number: the maximal number of points Gerald can earn. Print on the second line a sting consisting ofn+m- 2characters, each of which is either a \"C\" or \"S\", thei-th character should be \"C\" if Gerald'si-th move should be eating a candy and \"S\" if he should eat a stone.ExamplesInput2 2 100 00 1Output2SCInput3 3 100 2 00 0 2Output10CSSCInput3 3 20 1 11 1 0Output4SCSCNoteIn the first test if Gerald's first move is eating a stone, he will receive a point for it and if he eats a candy, he will get zero pints.
