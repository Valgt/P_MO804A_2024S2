LCMtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIvan has number $$$b$$$. He is sorting through the numbers $$$a$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$10^{18}$$$, and for every $$$a$$$ writes $$$\\\\frac{[a, \\\\,\\\\, b]}{a}$$$ on blackboard. Here $$$[a, \\\\,\\\\, b]$$$ stands for least common multiple of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. Ivan is very lazy, that's why this task bored him soon. But he is interested in how many different numbers he would write on the board if he would finish the task. Help him to find the quantity of different numbers he would write on the board.InputThe only line contains one integer — $$$b$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le b \\\\le 10^{10})$$$.OutputPrint one number — answer for the problem.ExamplesInput1Output1Input2Output2NoteIn the first example $$$[a, \\\\,\\\\, 1] = a$$$, therefore $$$\\\\frac{[a, \\\\,\\\\, b]}{a}$$$ is always equal to $$$1$$$.In the second example $$$[a, \\\\,\\\\, 2]$$$ can be equal to $$$a$$$ or $$$2 \\\\cdot a$$$ depending on parity of $$$a$$$. $$$\\\\frac{[a, \\\\,\\\\, b]}{a}$$$ can be equal to $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "57f2fe62", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an integer $b$ ($1 \\le b \\le 10^{10}$), find the number of distinct values of the expression $\\frac{[a, \\, b]}{a}$ for all integers $a$ from 1 to $10^{18}$, where $[a, \\, b]$ represents the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$."}, {"prompt_md5": "4db7db71", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number *b*, determine how many distinct numbers can be produced by the following operation for all numbers *a* from 1 to 10^18:  *a* divided by the least common multiple of *a* and *b*."}]}
