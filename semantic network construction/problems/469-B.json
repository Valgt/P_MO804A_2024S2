Chat Onlinetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLittle X and Little Z are good friends. They always chat online. But both of them have schedules.Little Z has fixed schedule. He always online at any moment of time betweena1andb1, betweena2andb2, ..., betweenapandbp(all borders inclusive). But the schedule of Little X is quite strange, it depends on the time when he gets up. If he gets up at time0, he will be online at any moment of time betweenc1andd1, betweenc2andd2, ..., betweencqanddq(all borders inclusive). But if he gets up at timet, these segments will be shifted byt. They become[ci+t,di+t](for alli).If at a moment of time, both Little X and Little Z are online simultaneosly, they can chat online happily. You know that Little X can get up at an integer moment of time betweenlandr(both borders inclusive). Also you know that Little X wants to get up at the moment of time, that is suitable for chatting with Little Z (they must have at least one common moment of time in schedules). How many integer moments of time from the segment[l,r]suit for that?InputThe first line contains four space-separated integersp,q,l,r(1 ≤p,q≤ 50; 0 ≤l≤r≤ 1000).Each of the nextplines contains two space-separated integersai,bi(0 ≤ai<bi≤ 1000).
