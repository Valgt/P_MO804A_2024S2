Omkar and Medianstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputUh oh! Ray lost his array yet again! However, Omkar might be able to help because he thinks he has found theOmkArrayof Ray's array. TheOmkArrayof an array $$$a$$$ with elements $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{2k-1}$$$, is the array $$$b$$$ with elements $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_{k}$$$ such that $$$b_i$$$ is equal to the median of $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{2i-1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$. Omkar has found an array $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$-10^9 \\\\leq b_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$). Given this array $$$b$$$, Ray wants to test Omkar's claim and see if $$$b$$$ actually is anOmkArrayof some array $$$a$$$. Can you help Ray?The median of a set of numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{2i-1}$$$ is the number $$$c_{i}$$$ where $$$c_{1}, c_{2}, \\\\ldots, c_{2i-1}$$$ represents $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{2i-1}$$$ sorted in nondecreasing order.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$b$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\leq b_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of $$$b$$$.It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one line containingYESif there exists an array $$$a$$$ such that $$$b_i$$$ is the median of $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_{2i-1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$, andNOotherwise.
