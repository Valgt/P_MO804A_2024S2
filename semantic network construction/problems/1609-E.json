William The Oblivioustime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBefore becoming a successful trader William got a university degree. During his education an interesting situation happened, after which William started to listen to homework assignments much more attentively. What follows is a formal description of the homework assignment as William heard it:You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ only consisting of characters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\". There are $$$q$$$ queries of format ($$$pos, c$$$), meaning replacing the element of string $$$s$$$ at position $$$pos$$$ with character $$$c$$$. After each query you must output the minimal number of characters in the string, which have to be replaced, so that the string doesn't contain string \"abc\" as asubsequence. A valid replacement of a character is replacing it with \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\".A string $$$x$$$ is said to be a subsequence of string $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deleting some characters without changing the ordering of the remaining characters.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n, q \\\\le 10^5)$$$, the length of the string and the number of queries, respectively.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of characters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\".Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains an integer $$$i$$$ and character $$$c$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le i \\\\le n)$$$, index and the value of the new item in the string, respectively. It is guaranteed that character's $$$c$$$ value is \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\".OutputFor each query output the minimal number of characters that would have to be replaced so that the string doesn't contain \"abc\" as a subsequence.ExampleInput9 12 aaabccccc 4 a 4 b 2 b 5 a 1 b 6 b 5 c 2 a 1 a 5 a 6 b 7 bOutput0 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 2NoteLet's consider the state of the string after each query:$$$s = $$$\"aaaaccccc\". In this case the string does not contain \"abc\" as a subsequence and no replacements are needed.$$$s = $$$\"aaabccccc\".
