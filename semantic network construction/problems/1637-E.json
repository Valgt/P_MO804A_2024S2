Best Pairtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Let $$$cnt_x$$$ be the number of elements from the array which are equal to $$$x$$$. Let's also define $$$f(x, y)$$$ as $$$(cnt_x + cnt_y) \\\\cdot (x + y)$$$.Also you are given $$$m$$$ bad pairs $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$. Note that if $$$(x, y)$$$ is a bad pair, then $$$(y, x)$$$ is also bad.Your task is to find the maximum value of $$$f(u, v)$$$ over all pairs $$$(u, v)$$$, such that $$$u \\\\neq v$$$, that this pair is not bad, and also that $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ each occur in the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that such a pair exists.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\\\le m \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array and the number of bad pairs.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — elements of the array.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i < y_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), which represent a bad pair. It is guaranteed that no bad pair occurs twice in the input. It is also guaranteed that $$$cnt_{x_i} > 0$$$ and $$$cnt_{y_i} > 0$$$.It is guaranteed that for each test case there is a pair of integers $$$(u, v)$$$, $$$u \\\\ne v$$$, that is not bad, and such that both of these numbers occur in $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ and the total sum of $$$m$$$ don't exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the answer to the problem.ExampleInput36 16 3 6 7 3 33 62 03 47 41 2 2 3 1 5 11 53 51 32 5Output40 14 15NoteIn the first test case $$$3$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$7$$$ occur in the array.$$$f(3, 6) = (cnt_3 + cnt_6) \\\\cdot (3 + 6) = (3 + 2) \\\\cdot (3 + 6) = 45$$$.
