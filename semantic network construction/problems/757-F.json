Team Rocket Rises Againtime limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt's the turn of the year, so Bash wants to send presents to his friends. There arencities in the Himalayan region and they are connected bymbidirectional roads. Bash is living in citys. Bash has exactly one friend in each of the other cities. Since Bash wants to surprise his friends, he decides to send a Pikachu to each of them.Since there may be some cities which are not reachable from Bash's city, he only sends a Pikachu to those friends who live in a city reachable from his own city. He also wants to send it to them as soon as possible.He finds out the minimum time for each of his Pikachus to reach its destination city. Since he is a perfectionist, he informs all his friends with the time their gift will reach them. A Pikachu travels at a speed of1meters per second. His friends were excited to hear this and would be unhappy if their presents got delayed. Unfortunately Team Rocket is on the loose and they came to know of Bash's plan. They want to maximize the number of friends who are unhappy with Bash.They do this by destroying exactly one of the othern- 1cities. This implies thatthe friend residing in that city dies, so he is unhappy as well.Note thatif a city is destroyed, all the roads directly connected to the city are also destroyed and the Pikachu may be forced to take a longer alternate route.Please also note that only friends that are waiting for a gift count as unhappy, even if they die.Since Bash is already a legend, can you help Team Rocket this time and find out the maximum number of Bash's friends who can be made unhappy by destroying exactly one city.InputThe first line contains three space separated integersn,mands(2 ≤n≤ 2·105,,1 ≤s≤n) — the number of cities and the number of roads in the Himalayan region and the city Bash lives in.Each of the nextmlines contain three space-separated integersu,vandw(1 ≤u,v≤n,u≠v,1 ≤w≤ 109) denoting that there exists a road between cityuand cityvof lengthwmeters.It is guaranteed that no road connects a city to itself and there are no two roads that connect the same pair of cities.OutputPrint a single integer, the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput4 4 31 2 12 3 12 4 13 1 1Output2Input7 11 21 2 51 3 52 4 22 5 23 6 33 7 34 6 23 4 26 7 34 5 74 7 7Output4NoteIn the first sample, on destroying the city2, the length of shortest distance between pairs of cities(3, 2)and(3, 4)will change.
