Bun Lovertime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTema loves cinnabon rolls — buns with cinnabon and chocolate in the shape of a \"snail\".Cinnabon rolls come in different sizes and are square when viewed from above. The most delicious part of a roll is the chocolate, which is poured in a thin layer over the cinnabon roll in the form of a spiral and around the bun, as in the following picture:Cinnabon rolls of sizes 4, 5, 6For a cinnabon roll of size $$$n$$$, the length of the outer side of the square is $$$n$$$, and the length of the shortest vertical chocolate segment in the central part is one.Formally, the bun consists of two dough spirals separated by chocolate. A cinnabon roll of size $$$n + 1$$$ is obtained from a cinnabon roll of size $$$n$$$ by wrapping each of the dough spirals around the cinnabon roll for another layer.It is important that a cinnabon roll of size $$$n$$$ is defined in a unique way.Tema is interested in how much chocolate is in his cinnabon roll of size $$$n$$$. Since Tema has long stopped buying small cinnabon rolls, it is guaranteed that $$$n \\\\ge 4$$$.Answer this non-obvious question by calculating the total length of the chocolate layer.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases.The following $$$t$$$ lines describe the test cases.Each test case is described by a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the size of the cinnabon roll.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th of them should be equal to the total length of the chocolate layer in the $$$i$$$-th test case.ExampleInput4456179179179Output26 37 50 32105178545472401", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ed66067b", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a number *n*.
