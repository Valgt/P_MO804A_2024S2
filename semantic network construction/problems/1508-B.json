Almost Sortedtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSeiji Maki doesn't only like to observe relationships being unfolded, he also likes to observe sequences of numbers, especially permutations. Today, he has his eyes onalmost sortedpermutations.A permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ of $$$1, 2, \\\\dots, n$$$ is said to bealmost sortedif the condition $$$a_{i + 1} \\\\ge a_i - 1$$$ holds for all $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n - 1$$$ inclusive.Maki is considering the list of all almost sorted permutations of $$$1, 2, \\\\dots, n$$$, given in lexicographical order, and he wants to find the $$$k$$$-th permutation in this list. Can you help him to find such permutation?Permutation $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a permutation $$$q$$$ if and only if the following holds:in the first position where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ differ, the permutation $$$p$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$q$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases.Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^{18}$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single line containing the $$$k$$$-th almost sorted permutation of length $$$n$$$ in lexicographical order, or $$$-1$$$ if it doesn't exist.ExampleInput5 1 1 1 2 3 3 6 5 3 4Output1  -1 2 1 3  1 2 4 3 5 6  3 2 1NoteFor the first and second test, the list of almost sorted permutations with $$$n = 1$$$ is $$$\\\\{[1]\\\\}$$$.For the third and fifth test, the list of almost sorted permutations with $$$n = 3$$$ is $$$\\\\{[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [3, 2, 1]\\\\}$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a8417493", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$ and a positive integer $k$.
