Beautiful Yeartime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutIt seems like the year of 2013 came only yesterday. Do you know a curious fact? The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.Now you are suggested to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.InputThe single line contains integery(1000 ≤y≤ 9000)— the year number.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum year number that is strictly larger thanyand all it's digits are distinct.
