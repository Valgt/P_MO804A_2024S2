X-Magic Pairtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a pair of integers $$$(a, b)$$$ and an integer $$$x$$$.You can change the pair in two different ways:set (assign) $$$a := |a - b|$$$;set (assign) $$$b := |a - b|$$$,where $$$|a - b|$$$ is the absolute difference between $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.The pair $$$(a, b)$$$ is called $$$x$$$-magic if $$$x$$$ is obtainable either as $$$a$$$ or as $$$b$$$ using only the given operations (i.e. the pair $$$(a, b)$$$ is $$$x$$$-magic if $$$a = x$$$ or $$$b = x$$$ after some number of operations applied). You can apply the operations any number of times (even zero).Your task is to find out if the pair $$$(a, b)$$$ is $$$x$$$-magic or not.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases.The only line of the test case contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b, x \\\\le 10^{18}$$$).OutputFor the $$$i$$$-th test case, printYESif the corresponding pair $$$(a, b)$$$ is $$$x$$$-magic andNOotherwise.ExampleInput8 6 9 3 15 38 7 18 8 8 30 30 30 40 50 90 24 28 20 365 216 52 537037812705867558 338887693834423551 3199921013340OutputYES YES YES YES NO YES YES YES", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f61832d9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers $a$ and $b$, and another integer $x$.
