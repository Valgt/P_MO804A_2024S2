Game with Stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya and Kolya play a game with a string, using the following rules. Initially, Kolya creates a strings, consisting of small English letters, and uniformly at random chooses an integerkfrom a segment[0,len(s) - 1]. He tells Vasya this strings, and then shifts itkletters to the left, i. e. creates a new stringt=sk+ 1sk+ 2...sns1s2...sk. Vasya does not know the integerknor the stringt, but he wants to guess the integerk. To do this, he asks Kolya to tell him the first letter of the new string, and then, after he sees it, open one more letter on some position, which Vasya can choose.Vasya understands, that he can't guarantee that he will win, but he wants to know the probability of winning, if he plays optimally. He wants you to compute this probability.Note that Vasya wants to know the value ofkuniquely, it means, that if there are at least two cyclic shifts ofsthat fit the information Vasya knowns, Vasya loses. Of course, at any moment of the game Vasya wants to maximize the probability of his win.InputThe only string contains the stringsof lengthl(3 ≤l≤ 5000), consisting of small English letters only.OutputPrint the only number — the answer for the problem.
