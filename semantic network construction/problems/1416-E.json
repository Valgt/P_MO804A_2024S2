Splittime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOne day,BTherodecided to play around with arrays and came up with the following problem:You are given an array $$$a$$$, which consists of $$$n$$$ positive integers. The array is numerated $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$. You execute the following procedureexactly once:You create a new array $$$b$$$ which consists of $$$2n$$$positiveintegers, where for each $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$ the condition $$$b_{2i-1}+b_{2i} = a_i$$$ holds. For example, for the array $$$a = [6, 8, 2]$$$ you can create $$$b = [2, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1]$$$.You merge consecutive equal numbers in $$$b$$$. For example, $$$b = [2, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1]$$$ becomes $$$b = [2, 4, 1]$$$.Find and printthe minimum possiblevalue of $$$|b|$$$ (size of $$$b$$$) which can be achieved at the end of the procedure. It can be shown that under the given constraints there is at least one way to construct $$$b$$$.InputThe first line of the input file contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) denoting the number of test cases. The description of $$$T$$$ test cases follows.The first line of each test contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that $$$\\\\sum{n}$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum possible value of $$$|b|$$$.ExampleInput3 3 6 8 2 1 4 3 5 6 6Output3 1 2", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b65c9d4c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of positive integers.
