Let the distance between two points $$$a_x$$$ and $$$a_y$$$ be $$$\\\\sum \\\\limits_{i = 1}^{k} |a_{x, i} - a_{y, i}|$$$ (it is also known as Manhattan distance).You have to process $$$q$$$ queries of the following two types:$$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$b_1$$$ $$$b_2$$$ ... $$$b_k$$$ — set $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$ to the point $$$(b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_k)$$$;$$$2$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ — find the maximum distance between two points $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$, where $$$l \\\\le i, j \\\\le r$$$.InputThe first line contains two numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$ and the number of dimensions of the space, respectively.Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, each containing $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_{i, 1}$$$, $$$a_{i, 2}$$$, ..., $$$a_{i, k}$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\\\le a_{i, j} \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the coordinates of $$$i$$$-th point.The next line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, each denoting a query. There are two types of queries:$$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$b_1$$$ $$$b_2$$$ ... $$$b_k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$, $$$-10^6 \\\\le b_j \\\\le 10^6$$$) — set $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$ to the point $$$(b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_k)$$$;$$$2$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$$$) — find the maximum distance between two points $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$, where $$$l \\\\le i, j \\\\le r$$$.There is at least one query of the second type.OutputPrint the answer for each query of the second type.ExampleInput5 2 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 7 2 1 5 2 1 3 2 3 5 1 5 -1 -2 2 1 5 1 4 -1 -2 2 1 5Output8 4 4 12 10", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "17a90a48", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ points in $k$-dimensional space.
