Far Relative’s Birthday Caketime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDoor's family is going celebrate Famil Doors's birthday party. They love Famil Door so they are planning to make his birthday cake weird!The cake is an×nsquare consisting of equal squares with side length1. Each square is either empty or consists of a single chocolate. They bought the cake and randomly started to put the chocolates on the cake. The value of Famil Door's happiness will be equal to the number of pairs of cells with chocolates that are in the same row or in the same column of the cake. Famil Doors's family is wondering what is the amount of happiness of Famil going to be?Please, note that any pair can be counted no more than once, as two different cells can't share both the same row and the same column.InputIn the first line of the input, you are given a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 100) — the length of the side of the cake.Then follownlines, each containingncharacters. Empty cells are denoted with '.', while cells that contain chocolates are denoted by 'C'.OutputPrint the value of Famil Door's happiness, i.e. the number of pairs of chocolate pieces that share the same row or the same column.ExamplesInput3.CCC..C.COutput4Input4CC..C..C.CC..CC.Output9NoteIf we number rows from top to bottom and columns from left to right, then, pieces that share the same row in the first sample are:(1, 2)and(1, 3)(3, 1)and(3, 3)Pieces that share the same column are:(2, 1)and(3, 1)(1, 3)and(3, 3)", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d04a8803", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a square cake of size $n \\times n$.
