Balanced Rating Changestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAnother Codeforces Round has just finished! It has gathered $$$n$$$ participants, and according to the results, the expected rating change of participant $$$i$$$ is $$$a_i$$$. These rating changes areperfectly balanced— their sum is equal to $$$0$$$.Unfortunately, due to minor technical glitches, the round is declaredsemi-rated. It means that all rating changes must be divided by two.There are two conditions though:For each participant $$$i$$$, their modified rating change $$$b_i$$$ must be integer, and as close to $$$\\\\frac{a_i}{2}$$$ as possible. It means that either $$$b_i = \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{a_i}{2} \\\\rfloor$$$ or $$$b_i = \\\\lceil \\\\frac{a_i}{2} \\\\rceil$$$. In particular, if $$$a_i$$$ is even, $$$b_i = \\\\frac{a_i}{2}$$$. Here $$$\\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor$$$ denotes rounding down to the largest integer not greater than $$$x$$$, and $$$\\\\lceil x \\\\rceil$$$ denotes rounding up to the smallest integer not smaller than $$$x$$$.The modified rating changes must be perfectly balanced — their sum must be equal to $$$0$$$.Can you help with that?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 13\\\\,845$$$), denoting the number of participants.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-336 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 1164$$$), denoting the rating change of the $$$i$$$-th participant.The sum of all $$$a_i$$$ is equal to $$$0$$$.OutputOutput $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_i$$$, each denoting the modified rating change of the $$$i$$$-th participant in order of input.For any $$$i$$$, it must be true that either $$$b_i = \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{a_i}{2} \\\\rfloor$$$ or $$$b_i = \\\\lceil \\\\frac{a_i}{2} \\\\rceil$$$. The sum of all $$$b_i$$$ must be equal to $$$0$$$.If there are multiple solutions, print any. We can show that a solution exists for any valid input.ExamplesInput3 10 -5 -5Output5 -2 -3Input7 -7 -29 0 3 24 -29 38Output-3 -15 0 2 12 -15 19NoteIn the first example, $$$b_1 = 5$$$, $$$b_2 = -3$$$ and $$$b_3 = -2$$$ is another correct solution.In the second example there are $$$6$$$ possible solutions, one of them is shown in the example output.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "373c3968", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, where the sum of all elements is 0.
