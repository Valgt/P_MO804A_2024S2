Roads not only in Berlandtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutBerland Government decided to improve relations with neighboring countries. First of all, it was decided to build new roads so that from each city of Berland and neighboring countries it became possible to reach all the others. There arencities in Berland and neighboring countries in total and exactlyn- 1two-way roads. Because of the recent financial crisis, the Berland Government is strongly pressed for money, so to build a new road it has to close some of the existing ones. Every day it is possible to close one existing road and immediately build a new one. Your task is to determine how many days would be needed to rebuild roads so that from each city it became possible to reach all the others, and to draw a plan of closure of old roads and building of new ones.InputThe first line contains integern(2 ≤n≤ 1000) — amount of cities in Berland and neighboring countries. Nextn- 1lines contain the description of roads. Each road is described by two space-separated integersai,bi(1 ≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi) — pair of cities, which the road connects. It can't be more than one road between a pair of cities. No road connects the city with itself.OutputOutput the answer, numbert— what is the least amount of days needed to rebuild roads so that from each city it became possible to reach all the others. Then outputtlines — the plan of closure of old roads and building of new ones. Each line should describe one day in the formati j u v— it means that road between citiesiandjbecame closed and a new road between citiesuandvis built. Cities are numbered from 1. If the answer is not unique, output any.ExamplesInput21 2Output0Input71 22 33 14 55 66 7Output13 1 3 7", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4c305455", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ cities.
