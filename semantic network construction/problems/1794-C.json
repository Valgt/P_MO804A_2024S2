Scoring Subsequencestime limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThescoreof a sequence $$$[s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_d]$$$ is defined as $$$\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{s_1\\\\cdot s_2\\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot s_d}{d!}$$$, where $$$d!=1\\\\cdot 2\\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot d$$$. In particular, the score of an empty sequence is $$$1$$$.For a sequence $$$[s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_d]$$$, let $$$m$$$ be the maximum score among all its subsequences. Itscostis defined as the maximum length of a subsequence with a score of $$$m$$$.You are given anon-decreasingsequence $$$[a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n]$$$ of integers of length $$$n$$$. In other words, the condition $$$a_1 \\\\leq a_2 \\\\leq \\\\ldots \\\\leq a_n$$$ is satisfied. For each $$$k=1, 2, \\\\ldots , n$$$, find the cost of the sequence $$$[a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots , a_k]$$$.A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the given sequence.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le a_i\\\\leq n$$$) — the given sequence. It is guaranteed that its elements are in non-decreasing order.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers — the costs of sequences $$$[a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots , a_k]$$$ in ascending order of $$$k$$$.ExampleInput331 2 321 155 5 5 5 5Output1 1 2  1 1  1 2 3 4 5NoteIn the first test case:The maximum score among the subsequences of $$$[1]$$$ is $$$1$$$. The subsequences $$$[1]$$$ and $$$[]$$$ (the empty sequence) are the only ones with this score. Thus, the cost of $$$[1]$$$ is $$$1$$$.The maximum score among the subsequences of $$$[1, 2]$$$ is $$$2$$$. The only subsequence with this score is $$$[2]$$$. Thus, the cost of $$$[1, 2]$$$ is $$$1$$$.The maximum score among the subsequences of $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ is $$$3$$$. The subsequences $$$[2, 3]$$$ and $$$[3]$$$ are the only ones with this score. Thus, the cost of $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ is $$$2$$$.Therefore, the answer to this case is $$$1\\\\:\\\\:1\\\\:\\\\:2$$$, which are the costs of $$$[1], [1, 2]$$$ and $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ in this order.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "829c1d7e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a non-decreasing sequence of integers.
