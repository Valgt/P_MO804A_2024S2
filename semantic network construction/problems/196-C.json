Paint Treetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYou are given a tree withnvertexes andnpoints on a plane, no three points lie on one straight line.Your task is to paint the given tree on a plane, using the given points as vertexes.That is, you should correspond each vertex of the tree to exactly one point and each point should correspond to a vertex. If two vertexes of the tree are connected by an edge, then the corresponding points should have a segment painted between them. The segments that correspond to non-adjacent edges, should not have common points. The segments that correspond to adjacent edges should have exactly one common point.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 1500) — the number of vertexes on a tree (as well as the number of chosen points on the plane).Each of the nextn- 1lines contains two space-separated integersuiandvi(1 ≤ui,vi≤n,ui≠vi) — the numbers of tree vertexes connected by thei-th edge.Each of the nextnlines contain two space-separated integersxiandyi(- 109≤xi,yi≤ 109) — the coordinates of thei-th point on the plane.
