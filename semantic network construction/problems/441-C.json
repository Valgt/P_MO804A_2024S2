Valera and Tubestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutValera has got a rectangle table consisting ofnrows andmcolumns. Valera numbered the table rows starting from one, from top to bottom and the columns – starting from one, from left to right. We will represent cell that is on the intersection of rowxand columnyby a pair of integers(x,y).Valera wants to place exactlyktubes on his rectangle table. A tube is such sequence of table cells(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xr,yr), that:r≥ 2;for any integeri(1 ≤i≤r- 1)the following equation|xi-xi+ 1| + |yi-yi+ 1| = 1holds;each table cell, which belongs to the tube, must occur exactly once in the sequence.Valera thinks that the tubes are arranged in a fancy manner if the following conditions are fulfilled:no pair of tubes has common cells;each cell of the table belongs to some tube.Help Valera to arrangektubes on his rectangle table in a fancy manner.InputThe first line contains three space-separated integersn,m,k(2 ≤n,m≤ 300;2 ≤ 2k≤n·m) — the number of rows, the number of columns and the number of tubes, correspondingly.OutputPrintklines. In thei-th line print the description of thei-th tube: first print integerri(the number of tube cells), then print2riintegersxi1,yi1,xi2,yi2, ...,xiri,yiri(the sequence of table cells).If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.ExamplesInput3 3 3Output3 1 1 1 2 1 33 2 1 2 2 2 33 3 1 3 2 3 3Input2 3 1Output6 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 3 2 2 2 1NotePicture for the first sample:Picture for the second sample:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "dd9ecb48", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a rectangular grid with $n$ rows and $m$ columns.
