The Contesttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPasha is participating in a contest on one well-known website. This time he wants to win the contest and will do anything to get to the first place!This contest consists ofnproblems, and Pasha solvesith problem inaitime units (his solutions are always correct). At any moment of time he can be thinking about a solution to only one of the problems (that is, he cannot be solving two problems at the same time). The time Pasha spends to send his solutions is negligible.Pasha can send any number of solutions at the same moment.Unfortunately, there are too many participants, and the website is not always working. Pasha received the information that the website will be working only duringmtime periods,jth period is represented by its starting momentljand ending momentrj. Of course, Pasha can send his solution only when the website is working. In other words, Pasha can send his solution at some momentTiff there exists a periodxsuch thatlx≤T≤rx.Pasha wants to know his best possible result. We need to tell him the minimal moment of time by which he is able to havesolutions to all problems submitted, if he acts optimally, or say that it's impossible no matter how Pasha solves the problems.InputThe first line contains one integern(1 ≤n≤ 1000)— the number of problems. The second line containsnintegersai(1 ≤ai≤ 105)— the time Pasha needs to solveith problem.The third line contains one integerm(0 ≤m≤ 1000)— the number of periods of time when the website is working. Nextmlines represent these periods.jth line contains two numbersljandrj(1 ≤lj<rj≤ 105)— the starting and the ending moment ofjth period.It is guaranteed that the periods are not intersecting and are given in chronological order, so for everyj> 1the conditionlj>rj- 1is met.OutputIf Pasha can solve and submit all the problems before the end of the contest, print the minimal moment of time by which he can have all the solutions submitted.Otherwise print \"-1\" (without brackets).ExamplesInput23 421 47 9Output7Input1511 4Output-1Input1511 5Output5NoteIn the first example Pasha can act like this: he solves the second problem in 4 units of time and sends it immediately. Then he spends 3 time units to solve the first problem and sends it 7 time units after the contest starts, because at this moment the website starts working again.In the second example Pasha invents the solution only after the website stops working for the last time.In the third example Pasha sends the solution exactly at the end of the first period.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "3e8dbe3e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ problems to solve.
