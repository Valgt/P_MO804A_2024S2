Little Artem and Presentstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLittle Artem gotnstones on his birthday and now wants to give some of them to Masha. He knows that Masha cares more about the fact of receiving the present, rather than the value of that present, so he wants to give her stones as many times as possible. However, Masha remembers the last present she received, so Artem can't give her the same number of stones twice in a row. For example, he can give her3stones, then1stone, then again3stones, but he can't give her3stones and then again3stones right after that.How many times can Artem give presents to Masha?InputThe only line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 109) — number of stones Artem received on his birthday.OutputPrint the maximum possible number of times Artem can give presents to Masha.ExamplesInput1Output1Input2Output1Input3Output2Input4Output3NoteIn the first sample, Artem can only give1stone to Masha.In the second sample, Atrem can give Masha1or2stones, though he can't give her1stone two times.In the third sample, Atrem can first give Masha2stones, a then1more stone.In the fourth sample, Atrem can first give Masha1stone, then2stones, and finally1stone again.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1b6a723e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have $n$ stones.
