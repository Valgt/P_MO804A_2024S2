All edges are directed from the root. Vertexuis called achildof vertexvand vertexvis called aparentof vertexuif there exists a directed edge fromvtou. A vertex is called aleafif it doesn't have children and has a parent.Let's call a rooted tree aspruceif its every non-leaf vertex has at least3leaf children. You are given a rooted tree, check whether it's a spruce.The definition of a rooted tree can be foundhere.InputThe first line contains one integern— the number of vertices in the tree (3 ≤n≤ 1 000). Each of the nextn- 1lines contains one integerpi(1 ≤i≤n- 1) — the index of the parent of thei+ 1-th vertex (1 ≤pi≤i).Vertex1is the root.
