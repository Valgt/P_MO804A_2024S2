In this game, he can craft tools of two types — shovels and swords. To craft a shovel, Polycarp spends two sticks and one diamond; to craft a sword, Polycarp spends two diamonds and one stick.Each tool can be sold for exactly one emerald. How many emeralds can Polycarp earn, if he has $$$a$$$ sticks and $$$b$$$ diamonds?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the number of sticks and the number of diamonds, respectively.OutputFor each test case print one integer — the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn.ExampleInput4 4 4 1000000000 0 7 15 8 7Output2 0 7 5NoteIn the first test case Polycarp can earn two emeralds as follows: craft one sword and one shovel.In the second test case Polycarp does not have any diamonds, so he cannot craft anything.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1731e438", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two numbers, $a$ and $b$, representing the number of sticks and diamonds, respectively. \n\nYou can craft tools using these resources:\n\n* **Shovel:** 2 sticks, 1 diamond\n* **Sword:** 2 diamonds, 1 stick\n\nEach tool can be sold for 1 emerald.\n\nFind the maximum number of emeralds you can earn."}, {"prompt_md5": "b85e1aaa", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You have a limited amount of sticks and diamonds.
