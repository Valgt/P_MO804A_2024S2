Vika and Bonusestime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA new bonus system has been introduced at Vika's favorite cosmetics store, \"Golden Pear\"!The system works as follows: suppose a customer has $$$b$$$ bonuses. Before paying for the purchase, the customer can choose one of two options:Get a discount equal to the current number of bonuses, while the bonuses are not deducted.Accumulate an additional $$$x$$$ bonuses, where $$$x$$$ is the last digit of the number $$$b$$$. As a result, the customer's account will have $$$b+x$$$ bonuses.For example, if a customer had $$$24$$$ bonuses, he can either get a discount of $$$24$$$ or accumulate an additional $$$4$$$ bonuses, after which his account will have $$$28$$$ bonuses.At the moment, Vika has already accumulated $$$s$$$ bonuses.The girl knows that during the remaining time of the bonus system, she will make $$$k$$$ more purchases at the \"Golden Pear\" store network.After familiarizing herself with the rules of the bonus system, Vika became interested in the maximum total discount she can get.Help the girl answer this question.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The test case consists of a single line containing two integers $$$s$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le s \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the current number of bonuses in Vika's account and how many more purchases the girl will make.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total discount that can be obtained through the bonus system.ExampleInput61 311 30 1795 1000000000723252212 856168102728598293 145725253Output4 33 0 9999999990 1252047198518668448 106175170582793129NoteIn the first test case, Vika can accumulate bonuses after the first and second purchases, after which she can get a discount of $$$4$$$.In the second test case, Vika can get a discount of $$$11$$$ three times, and the total discount will be $$$33$$$.In the third example, regardless of Vika's actions, she will always get a total discount of $$$0$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9bfa74a2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers, $s$ and $k$.  $s$ represents the current number of bonuses a person has, and $k$ represents the number of future purchases they will make.\n\nFor each purchase, the person can choose to:\n\n1.
