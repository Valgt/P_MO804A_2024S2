Dasha and Stairstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOn her way to programming school tiger Dasha faced her first test — a huge staircase!The steps were numbered from one to infinity. As we know, tigers are very fond of all striped things, it is possible that it has something to do with their color. So on some interval of her way she calculated two values — the number of steps with even and odd numbers.You need to check whether there is an interval of steps from thel-th to ther-th(1 ≤l≤r), for which values that Dasha has found are correct.InputIn the only line you are given two integersa,b(0 ≤a,b≤ 100)— the number of even and odd steps, accordingly.OutputIn the only line print \"YES\", if the interval of steps described above exists, and \"NO\" otherwise.ExamplesInput2 3OutputYESInput3 1OutputNONoteIn the first example one of suitable intervals is from1to5. The interval contains two even steps —2and4, and three odd:1,3and5.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f787ccac", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers, $a$ and $b$, representing the number of even and odd steps, respectively.
