We know that thei-th group consists ofsifriends (1 ≤si≤ 4), and they want to go to Polycarpus together. They decided to get there by taxi. Each car can carry at most four passengers. What minimum number of cars will the children need if all members of each group should ride in the same taxi (but one taxi can take more than one group)?InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105) — the number of groups of schoolchildren.
