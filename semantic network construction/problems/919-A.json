Supermarkettime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWe often go to supermarkets to buy some fruits or vegetables, and on the tag there prints the price for a kilo. But in some supermarkets, when asked how much the items are, the clerk will say that $$$a$$$yuanfor $$$b$$$ kilos (You don't need to care about what\"yuan\"is), the same as $$$a/b$$$yuanfor a kilo.Now imagine you'd like to buy $$$m$$$ kilos of apples. You've asked $$$n$$$ supermarkets and got the prices. Find the minimum cost for those apples.You can assume that there are enough apples in all supermarkets.InputThe first line contains two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 5\\\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 100$$$), denoting that there are $$$n$$$ supermarkets and you want to buy $$$m$$$ kilos of apples.The following $$$n$$$ lines describe the information of the supermarkets. Each line contains two positive integers $$$a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a, b \\\\leq 100$$$), denoting that in this supermarket, you are supposed to pay $$$a$$$yuanfor $$$b$$$ kilos of apples.OutputThe only line, denoting the minimum cost for $$$m$$$ kilos of apples. Please make sure that the absolute or relative error between your answer and the correct answer won't exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.Formally, let your answer be $$$x$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$y$$$.
