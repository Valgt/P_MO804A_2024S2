Yet Another Segments Subsettime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given $$$n$$$ segments on a coordinate axis $$$OX$$$. The $$$i$$$-th segment has borders $$$[l_i; r_i]$$$. All points $$$x$$$, for which $$$l_i \\\\le x \\\\le r_i$$$ holds, belong to the $$$i$$$-th segment.Your task is to choose themaximumby size (the number of segments) subset of the given set of segments such that each pair of segments in this subset either non-intersecting or one of them lies inside the other one.Two segments $$$[l_i; r_i]$$$ and $$$[l_j; r_j]$$$ are non-intersecting if they haveno common points. For example, segments $$$[1; 2]$$$ and $$$[3; 4]$$$, $$$[1; 3]$$$ and $$$[5; 5]$$$ are non-intersecting, while segments $$$[1; 2]$$$ and $$$[2; 3]$$$, $$$[1; 2]$$$ and $$$[2; 2]$$$ are intersecting.The segment $$$[l_i; r_i]$$$ lies inside the segment $$$[l_j; r_j]$$$ if $$$l_j \\\\le l_i$$$ and $$$r_i \\\\le r_j$$$. For example, segments $$$[2; 2]$$$, $$$[2, 3]$$$, $$$[3; 4]$$$ and $$$[2; 4]$$$ lie inside the segment $$$[2; 4]$$$, while $$$[2; 5]$$$ and $$$[1; 4]$$$ are not.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3000$$$) — the number of segments. The next $$$n$$$ lines describe segments. The $$$i$$$-th segment is given as two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$l_i$$$ is the left border of the $$$i$$$-th segment and $$$r_i$$$ is the right border of the $$$i$$$-th segment.Additional constraint on the input: there areno duplicatesin the list of segments.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$3000$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 3000$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer: themaximumpossible size of the subset of the given set of segments such that each pair of segments in this subset either non-intersecting or one of them lies inside the other one.ExampleInput4 4 1 5 2 4 2 3 3 4 5 1 5 2 3 2 5 3 5 2 2 3 1 3 2 4 2 3 7 1 10 2 8 2 5 3 4 4 4 6 8 7 7Output3 4 2 7", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e29ba2f3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ segments on a number line.
