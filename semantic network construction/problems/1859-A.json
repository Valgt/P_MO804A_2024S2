United We Standtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, containing integers. And there are two initially empty arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$. You need to add each element of array $$$a$$$ toexactly oneof the arrays $$$b$$$ or $$$c$$$, in order to satisfy the following conditions:Both arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ are non-empty. More formally, let $$$l_b$$$ be the length of array $$$b$$$, and $$$l_c$$$ be the length of array $$$c$$$. Then $$$l_b, l_c \\\\ge 1$$$.For any two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le l_b, 1 \\\\le j \\\\le l_c$$$), $$$c_j$$$is nota divisor of $$$b_i$$$.Output the arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ that can be obtained, or output $$$-1$$$ if they do not exist.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer $$$-1$$$ if a solution does not exist.Otherwise, in the first line, output two integers $$$l_b$$$ and $$$l_c$$$ — the lengths of arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ respectively.In the second line, output $$$l_b$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_{l_b}$$$ — the elements of array $$$b$$$.In the third line, output $$$l_c$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_{l_c}$$$ — the elements of array $$$c$$$.If there are multiple solutions, output any of them. You can output the elements of the arrays in any order.ExampleInput532 2 251 2 3 4 531 3 571 7 7 2 9 1 454 8 12 12 4Output-1 3 2 1 3 5  2 4  1 2 1  3 5  2 5 1 1  2 4 7 7 9  3 2 4 8 4  12 12NoteIn the first test case, a solution does not exist.In the second test case, we can obtain $$$b = [1, 3, 5]$$$ and $$$c = [2, 4]$$$.
