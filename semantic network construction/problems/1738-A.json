Glory Addictstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe hero is addicted to glory, and is fighting against a monster.The hero has $$$n$$$ skills. The $$$i$$$-th skill is of type $$$a_i$$$ (eitherfireorfrost) and has initial damage $$$b_i$$$.The hero can perform all of the $$$n$$$ skills in any order (with each skill performed exactlyonce). When performing each skill, the hero can play a magic as follows:If the current skill immediately follows another skill of a different type, then its damage isdoubled.In other words,If a skill of type fire and with initial damage $$$c$$$ is performed immediately after a skill of type fire, then it will deal $$$c$$$ damage;If a skill of type fire and with initial damage $$$c$$$ is performed immediately after a skill of type frost, then it will deal $$$2c$$$ damage;If a skill of type frost and with initial damage $$$c$$$ is performed immediately after a skill of type fire, then it will deal $$$2c$$$ damage;If a skill of type frost and with initial damage $$$c$$$ is performed immediately after a skill of type frost , then it will deal $$$c$$$ damage.Your task is to find themaximumdamage the hero can deal.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$), indicating the number of skills.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 1$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ indicates the type of the $$$i$$$-th skill. Specifically, the $$$i$$$-th skill is of type fire if $$$a_i = 0$$$, and of type frost if $$$a_i = 1$$$.The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq b_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$), where $$$b_i$$$ indicates the initial damage of the $$$i$$$-th skill.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the maximum damage the hero can deal.ExampleInput440 1 1 11 10 100 100060 0 0 1 1 13 4 5 6 7 831 1 11000000000 1000000000 1000000000111Output2112 63 3000000000 1NoteIn the first test case, we can order the skills by $$$[3, 1, 4, 2]$$$, and the total damage is $$$100 + 2 \\\\times 1 + 2 \\\\times 1000 + 10 = 2112$$$.In the second test case, we can order the skills by $$$[1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]$$$, and the total damage is $$$3 + 2 \\\\times 6 + 2 \\\\times 4 + 2 \\\\times 7 + 2 \\\\times 5 + 2 \\\\times 8 = 63$$$.In the third test case, we can order the skills by $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, and the total damage is $$$1000000000 + 1000000000 + 1000000000 = 3000000000$$$.In the fourth test case, there is only one skill with initial damage $$$1$$$, so the total damage is $$$1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c7287ba3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ skills, where each skill has a type ($0$ for fire or $1$ for frost) and an initial damage value.
