Portaltime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputCQXYM found a rectangle $$$A$$$ of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$. There are $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns of blocks. Each block of the rectangle is an obsidian block or empty. CQXYM can change an obsidian block to an empty block or an empty block to an obsidian block in one operation.A rectangle $$$M$$$ size of $$$a \\\\times b$$$ is called a portal if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:$$$a \\\\geq 5,b \\\\geq 4$$$.For all $$$1 < x < a$$$, blocks $$$M_{x,1}$$$ and $$$M_{x,b}$$$ are obsidian blocks.For all $$$1 < x < b$$$, blocks $$$M_{1,x}$$$ and $$$M_{a,x}$$$ are obsidian blocks.For all $$$1<x<a,1<y<b$$$, block $$$M_{x,y}$$$ is an empty block.$$$M_{1, 1}, M_{1, b}, M_{a, 1}, M_{a, b}$$$can be any type.Note that the there must be $$$a$$$ rows and $$$b$$$ columns, not $$$b$$$ rows and $$$a$$$ columns.Note that corners can be any typeCQXYM wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to make at least one sub-rectangle a portal.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$t \\\\geq 1$$$), which is the number of test cases.For each test case, the first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$5 \\\\le n \\\\le 400$$$, $$$4 \\\\le m \\\\le 400$$$).Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, each line contains $$$m$$$ characters $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. If the $$$j$$$-th character of $$$i$$$-th line is $$$0$$$, block $$$A_{i,j}$$$ is an empty block. Otherwise, block $$$A_{i,j}$$$ is an obsidian block.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$400$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$400$$$.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ answers, and each answer in a line.ExamplesInput1 5 4 1000 0000 0110 0000 0001Output12Input1 9 9 001010001 101110100 000010011 100000001 101010101 110001111 000001111 111100000 000110000Output5NoteIn the first test case, the final portal is like this:11101001100110010111", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d8cef556", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a rectangle of size $n \\times m$ filled with blocks.
