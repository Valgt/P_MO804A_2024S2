Asterism (Easy Version)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. The difference between versions is the constraints on $$$n$$$ and $$$a_i$$$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.First, Aoi came up with the following idea for the competitive programming problem:Yuzu is a girl who collecting candies. Originally, she has $$$x$$$ candies. There are also $$$n$$$ enemies numbered with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Enemy $$$i$$$ has $$$a_i$$$ candies.Yuzu is going to determine a permutation $$$P$$$. A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$\\\\{2,3,1,5,4\\\\}$$$ is a permutation, but $$$\\\\{1,2,2\\\\}$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$\\\\{1,3,4\\\\}$$$ is also not a permutation (because $$$n=3$$$ but there is the number $$$4$$$ in the array).After that, she will do $$$n$$$ duels with the enemies with the following rules:If Yuzu hasequal or morenumber of candies than enemy $$$P_i$$$, she wins the duel andgets $$$1$$$ candy. Otherwise, she loses the duel and gets nothing.The candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels.Yuzu wants towin all duels. How many valid permutations $$$P$$$ exist?This problem was easy and wasn't interesting for Akari, who is a friend of Aoi. And Akari made the following problem from the above idea:Let's define $$$f(x)$$$ as the number of valid permutations for the integer $$$x$$$.You are given $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$ anda prime number$$$p \\\\le n$$$. Let's call a positive integer $$$x$$$good, if the value $$$f(x)$$$ isnotdivisible by $$$p$$$. Findallgood integers $$$x$$$.Your task is to solve this problem made by Akari.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$p$$$ $$$(2 \\\\le p \\\\le n \\\\le 2000)$$$. It is guaranteed, that the number $$$p$$$ is prime (it has exactly two divisors $$$1$$$ and $$$p$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 2000)$$$.OutputIn the first line, print the number of good integers $$$x$$$.In the second line, output all good integers $$$x$$$in the ascending order.It is guaranteed that the number of good integers $$$x$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.ExamplesInput3 2 3 4 5Output1 3Input4 3 2 3 5 6Output2 3 4Input4 3 9 1 1 1Output0NoteIn the first test, $$$p=2$$$.If $$$x \\\\le 2$$$, there are no valid permutations for Yuzu. So $$$f(x)=0$$$ for all $$$x \\\\le 2$$$. The number $$$0$$$ is divisible by $$$2$$$, so all integers $$$x \\\\leq 2$$$ are not good.If $$$x = 3$$$, $$$\\\\{1,2,3\\\\}$$$ is the only valid permutation for Yuzu. So $$$f(3)=1$$$, so the number $$$3$$$ is good.If $$$x = 4$$$, $$$\\\\{1,2,3\\\\} , \\\\{1,3,2\\\\} , \\\\{2,1,3\\\\} , \\\\{2,3,1\\\\}$$$ are all valid permutations for Yuzu. So $$$f(4)=4$$$, so the number $$$4$$$ is not good.If $$$x \\\\ge 5$$$, all $$$6$$$ permutations are valid for Yuzu. So $$$f(x)=6$$$ for all $$$x \\\\ge 5$$$, so all integers $$$x \\\\ge 5$$$ are not good.So, the only good number is $$$3$$$.In the third test, for all positive integers $$$x$$$ the value $$$f(x)$$$ is divisible by $$$p = 3$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6d4899d8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$ and a prime number $p$ where $2 \\le p \\le n \\le 2000$.
