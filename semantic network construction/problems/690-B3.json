Recover Polygon (hard)time limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputZombies have found out about the Zombie Contamination level checker and managed to damage it! Now detecting the shape of their main compound will be a real challenge for Heidi. As before, a lair can be represented as a strictly convex polygon on a lattice. Each vertex of the polygon occupies a point on the lattice. However, the damaged Zombie Contamination level checker can only tell, for each cell, whether the level of Zombie Contamination for that cell is in the set{1, 2, 3}. In other words, Heidi knows all the cells of the lattice for which the Contamination level is not0and not4.Given this information, Heidi still wants to know the exact shape of the lair to rain destruction on the zombies. Help her!InputThe input contains multiple test cases.The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integersNandM, whereNis the size of the lattice grid (5 ≤N≤ 100000) andMis the number of lattice points for which the Zombie Contamination level is 1, 2, or 3 (8 ≤M≤ 200000).The second line of each test case containsMpairs of integersx1,y1, ...,xM,yM– coordinates of the cells with Zombie Contamination level not equal to 0 nor 4. It is guaranteed that1 ≤xi,yi≤N. All pairsxi,yiare different.Cells are enumerated based on the coordinates of their upper right corner. This means that the bottommost leftmost cell that touches the origin has coordinates(1, 1), and the uppermost leftmost cell is identified as(1,N).The last line of the file contains two zeroes. This line should not be treated as a test case. The sum of theMvalues for all tests in one file will not exceed200000.OutputFor each test case, the following output is expected:The first line of the output should contain one integerV, the number of vertices of the polygon that is the secret lair. The nextVlines each should contain two integers, denoting the vertices of the polygon in the clockwise order, starting from the lexicographically smallest vertex.ExampleInput8 192 3 2 4 2 5 3 3 3 5 4 3 4 5 4 6 5 2 5 3 5 6 6 2 6 3 6 4 6 5 6 6 6 7 7 6 7 75 82 2 2 3 2 4 3 2 3 4 4 2 4 3 4 40 0Output42 32 46 65 242 22 33 33 2NoteIt is guaranteed that the solution always exists and is unique.
