Lucky Ticketstime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutGerald has a friend, Pollard. Pollard is interested in lucky tickets (ticket is a sequence of digits). At first he thought that a ticket is lucky if between some its digits we can add arithmetic signs and brackets so that the result obtained by the arithmetic expression was number 100. But he quickly analyzed all such tickets and moved on to a more general question. Now he exploresk-lucky tickets.Pollard sais that a ticket isk-lucky if we can add arithmetic operation signs between its digits to the left or right of them (i.e., \"+\", \"-\", \"×\") and brackets so as to obtain the correct arithmetic expression whose value would equalk. For example, ticket \"224201016\" is 1000-lucky as( - 2 - (2 + 4)) × (2 + 0) + 1016 = 1000.Pollard was so carried away by the lucky tickets that he signed up for a seminar on lucky tickets and, as far as Gerald knows, Pollard will attend it daily at 7 pm in some famous institute and will commute to it in the same tram formdays. In this tram tickets have eight digits. And Gerald wants to make a surprise for Pollard: each day Pollard will receive a tramk-lucky ticket. The conductor has already agreed to give Pollard certain tickets during all thesemdays and he only wants Gerald to tell him what kind of tickets to give out. In this regard, help Gerald pick exactlymdistinctk-lucky tickets.InputThe single line contains two integerskandm(0 ≤k≤ 104,1 ≤m≤ 3·105).OutputPrintmlines. Each line must contain exactly 8 digits — thek-winning ticket. The tickets may begin with 0, all tickets must be distinct. If there are more thanmdistinctk-lucky tickets, print anymof them. It is guaranteed that at leastmdistinctk-lucky tickets exist. The tickets can be printed in any order.ExamplesInput0 3Output000000000000000100000002Input7 4Output00000007000000160000001700000018", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "740a09f8", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a target number *k*, find *m* unique 8-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 0-9 and arithmetic operators (+, -, *) to equal *k*."}, {"prompt_md5": "b006e83d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers $k$ and $m$.
