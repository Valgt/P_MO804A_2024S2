Weird Sumtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEgor has a table of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$, with lines numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and columns numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. Each cell has a color that can be presented as an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$10^5$$$.Let us denote the cell that lies in the intersection of the $$$r$$$-th row and the $$$c$$$-th column as $$$(r, c)$$$. We define themanhattan distancebetween two cells $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$ and $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$ as the length of a shortest path between them where each consecutive cells in the path must have a common side. The path can go through cells of any color. For example, in the table $$$3 \\\\times 4$$$ the manhattan distance between $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(3, 3)$$$ is $$$3$$$, one of the shortest paths is the following: $$$(1, 2) \\\\to (2, 2) \\\\to (2, 3) \\\\to (3, 3)$$$.Egor decided to calculate the sum of manhattan distances between each pair of cells of the same color. Help him to calculate this sum.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\le m$$$, $$$n \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 100\\\\,000$$$) — number of rows and columns in the table.Each of next $$$n$$$ lines describes a row of the table. The $$$i$$$-th line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$c_{i1}, c_{i2}, \\\\ldots, c_{im}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c_{ij} \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$) — colors of cells in the $$$i$$$-th row.OutputPrint one integer — the the sum of manhattan distances between each pair of cells of the same color.ExamplesInput2 3 1 2 3 3 2 1Output7Input3 4 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 1Output76Input4 4 1 1 2 3 2 1 1 2 3 1 2 1 1 1 2 1Output129NoteIn the first sample there are three pairs of cells of same color: in cells $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(2, 3)$$$, in cells $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2)$$$, in cells $$$(1, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 1)$$$.
