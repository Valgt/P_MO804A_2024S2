Dima and a Bad XORtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputStudent Dima from Kremland has a matrix $$$a$$$ of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$ filled with non-negative integers.He wants to select exactly one integer from each row of the matrix so that thebitwise exclusive ORof the selected integers is strictly greater than zero. Help him!Formally, he wants to choose an integers sequence $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq c_j \\\\leq m$$$) so that the inequality $$$a_{1, c_1} \\\\oplus a_{2, c_2} \\\\oplus \\\\ldots \\\\oplus a_{n, c_n} > 0$$$ holds, where $$$a_{i, j}$$$ is the matrix element from the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column.Here $$$x \\\\oplus y$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operationof integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, m \\\\leq 500$$$) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the matrix $$$a$$$.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers: the $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$i$$$-th line is the $$$j$$$-th element of the $$$i$$$-th row of the matrix $$$a$$$, i.e. $$$a_{i, j}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_{i, j} \\\\leq 1023$$$).OutputIf there is no way to choose one integer from each row so that their bitwise exclusive OR is strictly greater than zero, print \"NIE\".Otherwise print \"TAK\" in the first line, in the next line print $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq c_j \\\\leq m$$$), so that the inequality $$$a_{1, c_1} \\\\oplus a_{2, c_2} \\\\oplus \\\\ldots \\\\oplus a_{n, c_n} > 0$$$ holds.If there is more than one possible answer, you may output any.ExamplesInput3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0OutputNIEInput2 3 7 7 7 7 7 10OutputTAK 1 3NoteIn the first example, all the numbers in the matrix are $$$0$$$, so it is impossible to select one number in each row of the table so that their bitwise exclusive OR is strictly greater than zero.In the second example, the selected numbers are $$$7$$$ (the first number in the first line) and $$$10$$$ (the third number in the second line), $$$7 \\\\oplus 10 = 13$$$, $$$13$$$ is more than $$$0$$$, so the answer is found.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "cab214e4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a matrix of size $n \\times m$ filled with non-negative integers.
