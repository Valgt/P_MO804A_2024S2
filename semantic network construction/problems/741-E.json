Mehrdad is interested about the reason, so he asked Sipa, one of the best biology scientists in Arpa's land, for help. Sipa has a DNA editor.Sipa put Arpa under the DNA editor. DNA editor showed Arpa's DNA as a stringSconsisting ofnlowercase English letters. Also Sipa has another DNATconsisting of lowercase English letters that belongs to a normal man.Now there are(n+ 1)options to change Arpa's DNA, numbered from0ton.i-th of them is to putTbetweeni-th and(i+ 1)-th characters ofS(0 ≤i≤n). Ifi= 0,Twill be put beforeS, and ifi=n, it will be put afterS.Mehrdad wants to choose the mostinterestingoption for Arpa's DNA among thesen+ 1options. DNAAis moreinterestingthanBifAis lexicographically smaller thanB. Mehrdad asked Sipaqquestions:Given integersl,r,k,x,y, what is the most interesting option if we only consider such optionsithatl≤i≤rand? If there are several most interesting options, Mehrdad wants to know one with the smallest numberi.Since Sipa is a biology scientist but not a programmer, you should help him.InputThe first line contains stringsS,Tand integerq(1 ≤ |S|, |T|,q≤ 105) — Arpa's DNA, the DNA of a normal man, and the number of Mehrdad's questions. The stringsSandTconsist only of small English letters.Nextqlines describe the Mehrdad's questions. Each of these lines contain five integersl,r,k,x,y(0 ≤l≤r≤n,1 ≤k≤n,0 ≤x≤y<k).OutputPrintqintegers. Thej-th of them should be the numberiof the most interesting option among those that satisfy the conditions of thej-th question.
