The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changedtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe main road in Bytecity is a straight line from south to north. Conveniently, there are coordinates measured in meters from the southernmost building in north direction.At some points on the road there arenfriends, andi-th of them is standing at the pointximeters and can move with any speed no greater thanvimeters per second in any of the two directions along the road: south or north.You are to compute the minimum time needed to gather all thenfriends at some point on the road. Note that the point they meet at doesn't need to have integer coordinate.InputThe first line contains single integern(2 ≤n≤ 60 000) — the number of friends.The second line containsnintegersx1,x2, ...,xn(1 ≤xi≤ 109) — the current coordinates of the friends, in meters.The third line containsnintegersv1,v2, ...,vn(1 ≤vi≤ 109) — the maximum speeds of the friends, in meters per second.OutputPrint the minimum time (in seconds) needed for all thenfriends to meet at some point on the road.Your answer will be considered correct, if its absolute or relative error isn't greater than10- 6.
