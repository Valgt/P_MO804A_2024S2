Codewordtime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe famous sculptor Cicasso is a Reberlandian spy!These is breaking news in Berlandian papers today. And now the sculptor is hiding. This time you give the shelter to the maestro. You have a protected bunker and you provide it to your friend. You set the security system in such way that only you can open the bunker. To open it one should solve the problem which is hard for others but is simple for you.Every day the bunker generates a codewords. Every time someone wants to enter the bunker, integernappears on the screen. As the answer one should enter another integer — the residue modulo109+ 7of the number of strings of lengthnthat consist only of lowercase English letters and contain the stringsas thesubsequence.The subsequence of stringais a stringbthat can be derived from the stringaby removing some symbols from it (maybe none or all of them). In particular any string is the subsequence of itself. For example, the string \"cfo\" is the subsequence of the string \"codeforces\".You haven't implemented the algorithm that calculates the correct answers yet and you should do that ASAP.InputThe first line contains integerm(1 ≤m≤ 105) — the number of the events in the test case.The second line contains nonempty strings— the string generated by the bunker for the current day.The nextmlines contain the description of the events. The description starts from integert— the type of the event.Ift= 1consider a new day has come and now a new stringsis used. In that case the same line contains a new value of the strings.Ift= 2integernis given(1 ≤n≤ 105). This event means that it's needed to find the answer for the current stringsand the valuen.The sum of lengths of all generated strings doesn't exceed105. All of the given strings consist only of lowercase English letters.OutputFor each query of the type2print the answer modulo109+ 7on the separate line.ExampleInput3a2 21 bc2 5Output51162626NoteIn the first event words of the form \"a?\" and \"?a\" are counted, where?is an arbitrary symbol.
