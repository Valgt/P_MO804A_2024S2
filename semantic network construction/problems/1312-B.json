Bogosorttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots , a_n$$$. Array is good if for each pair of indexes $$$i < j$$$ the condition $$$j - a_j \\\\ne i - a_i$$$ holds. Can you shuffle this array so that it becomes good? To shuffle an array means to reorder its elements arbitrarily (leaving the initial order is also an option).For example, if $$$a = [1, 1, 3, 5]$$$, then shuffled arrays $$$[1, 3, 5, 1]$$$, $$$[3, 5, 1, 1]$$$ and $$$[5, 3, 1, 1]$$$ are good, but shuffled arrays $$$[3, 1, 5, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 1, 3, 5]$$$ and $$$[1, 1, 5, 3]$$$ aren't.It's guaranteed that it's always possible to shuffle an array to meet this condition.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots , a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 100$$$).OutputFor each test case print the shuffled version of the array $$$a$$$ which is good.ExampleInput3 1 7 4 1 1 3 5 6 3 2 1 5 6 4Output7 1 5 1 3 2 4 6 1 3 5", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e983433a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
