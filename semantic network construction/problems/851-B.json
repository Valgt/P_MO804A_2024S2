Arpa and an exam about geometrytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputArpa is taking a geometry exam. Here is the last problem of the exam.You are given three pointsa,b,c.Find a point and an angle such that if we rotate the page around the point by the angle, the new position ofais the same as the old position ofb, and the new position ofbis the same as the old position ofc.Arpa is doubting if the problem has a solution or not (i.e. if there exists a point and an angle satisfying the condition). Help Arpa determine if the question has a solution or not.InputThe only line contains six integersax,ay,bx,by,cx,cy(|ax|, |ay|, |bx|, |by|, |cx|, |cy| ≤ 109). It's guaranteed that the points are distinct.OutputPrint \"Yes\" if the problem has a solution, \"No\" otherwise.You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).ExamplesInput0 1 1 1 1 0OutputYesInput1 1 0 0 1000 1000OutputNoNoteIn the first sample test, rotate the page around(0.5, 0.5)by.In the second sample test, you can't find any solution.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "60e3df39", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given three distinct points  $(x_a, y_a)$, $(x_b, y_b)$, and $(x_c, y_c)$, determine if there exists a point $(x_o, y_o)$ and an angle $\\theta$ such that rotating the plane counterclockwise around $(x_o, y_o)$ by an angle of $\\theta$ degrees maps:\n\n* Point $(x_a, y_a)$ to $(x_b, y_b)$\n* Point $(x_b, y_b)$ to $(x_c, y_c)$ \n\nOutput \"Yes\" if such a point and angle exist, and \"No\" otherwise."}, {"prompt_md5": "693391c8", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given three distinct points, determine if there is a point and an angle that, when the plane is rotated around that point by that angle, will map the first point to the second point, and the second point to the third point."}]}
