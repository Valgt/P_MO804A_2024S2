Gastronomic Eventtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSWERC organizers want to hold a gastronomic event.The location of the event is a building with $$$n$$$ rooms connected by $$$n-1$$$ corridors (each corridor connects two rooms) so that it is possible to go from any room to any other room.In each room you have to set up the tasting of a typical Italian dish. You can choose from $$$n$$$ typical Italian dishes rated from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ depending on how good they are ($$$n$$$ is the best possible rating). The $$$n$$$ dishes have distinct ratings.You want to assign the $$$n$$$ dishes to the $$$n$$$ rooms so that the number of pleasing tours is maximal. Apleasing touris a nonempty sequence of rooms so that:Each room in the sequence is connected to the next one in the sequence by a corridor.The ratings of the dishes in the rooms (in the order given by the sequence) are increasing.If you assign the $$$n$$$ dishes optimally, what is the maximum number of pleasing tours?InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\\\le n\\\\le 1\\\\,000\\\\,000$$$) â€” the number of rooms.The second line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\\\cdots , p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq p_i < i$$$). Each $$$p_i$$$ indicates that there is a corridor between room $$$i$$$ and room $$$p_i$$$. It is guaranteed that the building has the property that it is possible to go from any room to any other room.OutputPrint the maximum number of pleasing tours.ExamplesInput5 1 2 2 2Output13Input10 1 2 3 4 3 2 7 8 7Output47NoteIn thefirst sample, it is optimal to place the dish with rating $$$1$$$ in room $$$1$$$, the dish with rating $$$2$$$ in room $$$3$$$, the dish with rating $$$3$$$ in room $$$2$$$, the dish with rating $$$4$$$ in room $$$5$$$ and the dish with rating $$$5$$$ in room $$$4$$$.All the $$$13$$$ possible pleasing tours are: $$$(1)$$$, $$$(2)$$$, $$$(3)$$$, $$$(4)$$$, $$$(5)$$$, $$$(1,2)$$$, $$$(3,2)$$$, $$$(2,4)$$$, $$$(2,5)$$$, $$$(1,2,4)$$$, $$$(1,2,5)$$$, $$$(3,2,4)$$$, $$$(3,2,5)$$$.There are also other ways to assign the dishes to the rooms so that there are $$$13$$$ pleasing tours.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f72d3d8f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have $n$ rooms connected by $n-1$ corridors.
