Random Eventstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRon is a happy owner of a permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).Ron's permutation is subjected to $$$m$$$ experiments of the following type: ($$$r_i$$$, $$$p_i$$$). This means that elements in range $$$[1, r_i]$$$ (in other words, the prefix of length $$$r_i$$$) have to be sorted in ascending order with the probability of $$$p_i$$$. All experiments are performed in the same order in which they are specified in the input data.As an example, let's take a look at a permutation $$$[4, 2, 1, 5, 3]$$$ and an experiment ($$$3, 0.6$$$). After such an experiment with the probability of $$$60\\\\%$$$ the permutation will assume the form $$$[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]$$$ and with a $$$40\\\\%$$$ probability it will remain unchanged.You have to determine the probability of the permutation becoming completely sorted in ascending order after $$$m$$$ experiments.InputEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$).The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 10^5)$$$ — the length of the permutation and the number of experiments, respectively.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n)$$$ — contents of the permutation.The following $$$m$$$ lines of each test case each contain an integer $$$r_i$$$ and a real number $$$p_i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le r_i \\\\le n, 0 \\\\le p_i \\\\le 1)$$$ — the length of the prefix and the probability of it being sorted. All probabilities are given with at most $$$6$$$ decimal places.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n, \\\\sum m \\\\le 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print a single number — the probability that after all experiments the permutation becomes sorted in ascending order. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\\\\frac{|a - b|}{\\\\max{(1, |b|)}} \\\\le 10^{-6}$$$.ExampleInput4 4 3 4 3 2 1 1 0.3 3 1 4 0.6 5 3 4 2 1 3 5 3 0.8 4 0.6 5 0.3 6 5 1 3 2 4 5 6 4 0.9 5 0.3 2 0.4 6 0.7 3 0.5 4 2 1 2 3 4 2 0.5 4 0.1Output0.600000 0.720000 0.989500 1.000000NoteExplanation of the first test case: It can be demonstrated that whether the final permutation is sorted or not depends solely on sorting being performed in the $$$(4, 0.6)$$$ experiment.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "61469746", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a permutation of length $n$ consisting of distinct integers from 1 to $n$.
