Good Kidtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSlavic is preparing a present for a friend's birthday. He has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ digits and the present will be the product of all these digits. Because Slavic is a good kid who wants to make the biggest product possible, he wants to add $$$1$$$ to exactly one of his digits.What is the maximum product Slavic can make?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 9$$$) — the number of digits.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 9$$$) — the digits in the array.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum product Slavic can make, by adding $$$1$$$ to exactly one of his digits.ExampleInput442 2 1 230 1 254 3 2 3 499 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9Output16 2 432 430467210", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "bed6f309", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of digits.
