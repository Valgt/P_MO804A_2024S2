The next line contains the sequence of integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that the sum of allaidoesn't exceed1000.OutputPrintmax|yi-yj|lines (whereykis theycoordinate of thek-th point of the polyline), in each line printcharacters. Each character must equal either «/» (slash), «\\\\» (backslash), «» (space). The printed image must be the image of the given polyline. Please study the test samples for better understanding of how to print a cardiogram.Notethat in this problem the checker checks your answer taking spaces into consideration. Do not print any extra characters.
