Players have to say words in turns. You cannot say a word which was already said. PolandBall starts. The Ball which can't say a new word loses.You're given two lists of words familiar to PolandBall and EnemyBall. Can you determine who wins the game, if both play optimally?InputThe first input line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 103) — number of words PolandBall and EnemyBall know, respectively.Thennstrings follow, one per line — words familiar to PolandBall.Thenmstrings follow, one per line — words familiar to EnemyBall.Note that one Ballcannotknow a word more than once (strings are unique), but some wordscanbe known by both players.Each word is non-empty and consists of no more than500lowercase English alphabet letters.OutputIn a single line of print the answer — \"YES\" if PolandBall wins and \"NO\" otherwise.
