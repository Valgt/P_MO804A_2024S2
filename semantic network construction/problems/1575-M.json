Managing Telephone Polestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMr. Chanek's city can be represented as a plane. He wants to build a housing complex in the city.There are some telephone poles on the plane, which is represented by a grid $$$a$$$ of size $$$(n + 1) \\\\times (m + 1)$$$. There is a telephone pole at $$$(x, y)$$$ if $$$a_{x, y} = 1$$$.For each point $$$(x, y)$$$, define $$$S(x, y)$$$ as the square of the Euclidean distance between the nearest pole and $$$(x, y)$$$. Formally, the square of the Euclidean distance between two points $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ is $$$(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2$$$.To optimize the building plan, the project supervisor asks you the sum of all $$$S(x, y)$$$ for each $$$0 \\\\leq x \\\\leq n$$$ and $$$0 \\\\leq y \\\\leq m$$$. Help him by finding the value of $$$\\\\sum_{x=0}^{n} {\\\\sum_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}}$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq n, m < 2000$$$) — the size of the grid.Then $$$(n + 1)$$$ lines follow, each containing $$$(m + 1)$$$ integers $$$a_{i, j}$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_{i, j} \\\\leq 1$$$) — the grid denoting the positions of telephone poles in the plane. There is at least one telephone pole in the given grid.OutputOutput an integer denoting the value of $$$\\\\sum_{x=0}^{n} {\\\\sum_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}}$$$.ExamplesInput2 2 101 000 000Output18Input5 4 10010 00000 01000 00001 00100 00010Output36NoteIn the first example, the nearest telephone pole for the points $$$(0,0)$$$, $$$(1,0)$$$, $$$(2,0)$$$, $$$(0,1)$$$, $$$(1,1)$$$, and $$$(2,1)$$$ is at $$$(0, 0)$$$. While the nearest telephone pole for the points $$$(0, 2)$$$, $$$(1,2)$$$, and $$$(2,2)$$$ is at $$$(0, 2)$$$. Thus, $$$\\\\sum_{x=0}^{n} {\\\\sum_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}} = (0 + 1 + 4) + (1 + 2 + 5) + (0 + 1 + 4) = 18$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e8551af8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a grid of size $(n+1) \\times (m+1)$ where each cell contains a 0 or a 1.
