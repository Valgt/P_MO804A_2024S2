Define $$$A$$$-characteristic of this array as a number of pairs of indices $$$1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n$$$, such that $$$a_i \\\\cdot a_j = 1$$$.Find any array $$$a$$$ with given length $$$n$$$ with $$$A$$$-characteristic equal to the given value $$$k$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$; $$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le \\\\frac{(n-1) n}{2}$$$) — the length of required array and required $$$A$$$-characteristic.OutputFor each test case, if there is no array $$$a$$$ with given $$$A$$$-characteristic $$$k$$$, printNO.Otherwise, printYESand $$$n$$$ numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$-1$$$, which form the required array $$$a$$$.
