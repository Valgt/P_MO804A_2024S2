Another Array Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers.

By using operation $$$(1,2)$$$ we transform the array from $$$[9,1]$$$ into $$$[8,8]$$$, thus the sum of the final array is $$$16$$$.In the third test case, it can be shown that it is not possible to achieve a sum $$$> 18$$$ by using these operations, therefore the maximum sum is $$$18$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9efd30cd", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers.
