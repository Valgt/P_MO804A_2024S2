Restore the Weathertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ containing the weather forecast for Berlandia for the last $$$n$$$ days. That is, $$$a_i$$$ — is the estimated air temperature on day $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$).You are also given an array $$$b$$$ — the air temperature that was actually present on each of the days. However, all the values in array $$$b$$$ are mixed up.Determine which day was which temperature, if you know that the weather never differs from the forecast by more than $$$k$$$ degrees. In other words, if on day $$$i$$$ the real air temperature was $$$c$$$, then the equality $$$|a_i - c| \\\\le k$$$ is always true.For example, let an array $$$a$$$ = [$$$1, 3, 5, 3, 9$$$] of length $$$n = 5$$$ and $$$k = 2$$$ be given and an array $$$b$$$ = [$$$2, 5, 11, 2, 4$$$]. Then, so that the value of $$$b_i$$$ corresponds to the air temperature on day $$$i$$$, we can rearrange the elements of the array $$$b$$$ so: [$$$2, 2, 5, 4, 11$$$]. Indeed:On the $$$1$$$st day, $$$|a_1 - b_1| = |1 - 2| = 1$$$, $$$1 \\\\le 2 = k$$$ is satisfied;On the $$$2$$$nd day $$$|a_2 - b_2| = |3 - 2| = 1$$$, $$$1 \\\\le 2 = k$$$ is satisfied;On the $$$3$$$rd day, $$$|a_3 - b_3| = |5 - 5| = 0$$$, $$$0 \\\\le 2 = k$$$ is satisfied;On the $$$4$$$th day, $$$|a_4 - b_4| = |3 - 4| = 1$$$, $$$1 \\\\le 2 = k$$$ is satisfied;On the $$$5$$$th day, $$$|a_5 - b_5| = |9 - 11| = 2$$$, $$$2 \\\\le 2 = k$$$ is satisfied.InputThe first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le10^9$$$) — the number of days and the maximum difference between the expected and actual air temperature on each day.The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers — elements of array $$$a$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).The third line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers — elements of array $$$b$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, and that the elements of array $$$b$$$ can always be rearranged so that the equality $$$|a_i - b_i| \\\\le k$$$ is true for all $$$i$$$.OutputOn a separate line for each test case, output exactly $$$n$$$ numbers — the values of air temperature on each of the days in the correct order.If there is more than one answer — output any of them.ExampleInput35 21 3 5 3 92 5 11 2 46 1-1 3 -2 0 -5 -1-4 0 -1 4 0 03 37 7 79 4 8Output2 2 5 4 11 0 4 -1 0 -4 0 8 4 9", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a1f25c23", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two arrays,  'a' and 'b', both of the same length 'n'.
