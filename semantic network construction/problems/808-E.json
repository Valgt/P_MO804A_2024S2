Selling Souvenirstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAfter several latest reforms many tourists are planning to visit Berland, and Berland people understood that it's an opportunity to earn money and changed their jobs to attract tourists. Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya hasndifferent souvenirs to sell;ith souvenir is characterised by its weightwiand costci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater thanm, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 100000,1 ≤m≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Thennlines follow.ith line contains two integerswiandci(1 ≤wi≤ 3,1 ≤ci≤ 109) — the weight and the cost ofith souvenir.OutputPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.ExamplesInput1 12 1Output0Input2 21 32 2Output3Input4 33 102 72 81 1Output10", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ffb6026c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of $n$ items, each with a weight ($w_i$) and a cost ($c_i$).
