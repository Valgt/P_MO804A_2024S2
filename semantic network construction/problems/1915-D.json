Unnatural Language Processingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLura was bored and decided to make a simple language using the five letters $$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{b}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{c}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{d}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{e}$$$. There are two types of letters:vowels— the letters $$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$ and $$$\\\\texttt{e}$$$. They are represented by $$$\\\\textsf{V}$$$.consonants— the letters $$$\\\\texttt{b}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{c}$$$, and $$$\\\\texttt{d}$$$. They are represented by $$$\\\\textsf{C}$$$.There are two types ofsyllablesin the language: $$$\\\\textsf{CV}$$$ (consonant followed by vowel) or $$$\\\\textsf{CVC}$$$ (vowel with consonant before and after). For example, $$$\\\\texttt{ba}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{ced}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{bab}$$$ are syllables, but $$$\\\\texttt{aa}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{eda}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{baba}$$$ are not.Awordin the language is a sequence of syllables. Lura has written a word in the language, but she doesn't know how to split it into syllables. Help her break the word into syllables.For example, given the word $$$\\\\texttt{bacedbab}$$$, it would be split into syllables as $$$\\\\texttt{ba.ced.bab}$$$ (the dot $$$\\\\texttt{.}$$$ represents a syllable boundary).InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the word.The second line of each test case contains a string consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin characters  — the word.All words given are valid words in the language; that is, they only use the letters $$$\\\\texttt{a}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{b}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{c}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{d}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{e}$$$, and each word is made up of several syllables.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor test case, output a string denoting the word split into syllables by inserting a dot $$$\\\\texttt{.}$$$ between every pair of adjacent syllables.If there are multiple possible splittings, output any of them. The input is given in such a way that at least one possible splitting exists.ExampleInput68bacedbab4baba13daddecabeddad3dac6dacdac22dababbabababbabbababbaOutputba.ced.bab ba.ba dad.de.ca.bed.dad dac dac.dac da.bab.ba.ba.bab.bab.ba.bab.ba", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "aa6a041f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a word made up of only the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'.  \n\nThe word follows these rules:\n\n*  'a' and 'e' are vowels.\n*  'b', 'c', and 'd' are consonants.\n*  Words are made up of syllables.\n*  A syllable can be 'CV' (consonant followed by vowel) or 'CVC' (vowel with a consonant before and after).\n\nYour task is to split the given word into syllables by inserting a dot ('.') between each syllable. \n\nFor example, if the word is \"bacedbab\", the output should be \"ba.ced.bab\". \n\n\n\nYou will be given multiple words to process."}, {"prompt_md5": "674d918d", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a word made up of only the letters a, b, c, d, and e, split the word into syllables.
