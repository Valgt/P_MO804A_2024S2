DIY Treetime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWilliam really likes puzzle kits. For one of his birthdays, his friends gifted him a complete undirected edge-weighted graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices.He wants to build a spanning tree of this graph, such that for the first $$$k$$$ vertices the following condition is satisfied: the degree of a vertex with index $$$i$$$ does not exceed $$$d_i$$$. Vertices from $$$k + 1$$$ to $$$n$$$ may have any degree.William wants you to find the minimum weight of a spanning tree that satisfies all the conditions.A spanning tree is a subset of edges of a graph that forms a tree on all $$$n$$$ vertices of the graph. The weight of a spanning tree is defined as the sum of weights of all the edges included in a spanning tree.InputThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 50$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq min(n - 1, 5)$$$).The second line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\\\ldots, d_k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq d_i \\\\leq n$$$).The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains $$$n - i$$$ integers $$$w_{i,i+1}, w_{i,i+2}, \\\\ldots, w_{i,n}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq w_{i,j} \\\\leq 100$$$): weights of edges $$$(i,i+1),(i,i+2),\\\\ldots,(i,n)$$$.OutputPrint one integer: the minimum weight of a spanning tree under given degree constraints for the first $$$k$$$ vertices.ExampleInput10 5 5 3 4 2 1 29 49 33 12 55 15 32 62 37 61 26 15 58 15 22 8 58 37 16 9 39 20 14 58 10 15 40 3 19 55 53 13 37 44 52 23 59 58 4 69 80 29 89 28 48Output95", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c45e8363", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an undirected, weighted graph with $n$ vertices.
