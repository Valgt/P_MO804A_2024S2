Anti-Increasing Addictstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an $$$n \\\\times n$$$ grid.We write $$$(i, j)$$$ to denote the cell in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column. For each cell, you are told whether yon can delete it or not.Given an integer $$$k$$$, you are asked to deleteexactly$$$(n-k+1)^2$$$ cells from the grid such that the following condition holds.You cannot find $$$k$$$ not deleted cells $$$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\\\dots, (x_k, y_k)$$$ that are strictly increasing, i.e., $$$x_i < x_{i+1}$$$ and $$$y_i < y_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\leq i < k$$$.Your task is to find a solution, or report that it is impossible.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1000$$$).Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains a binary string $$$s_i$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The $$$j$$$-th character of $$$s_i$$$ is1if you can delete cell $$$(i, j)$$$, and0otherwise.It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, if there is no way to delete exactly $$$(n-k+1)^2$$$ cells to meet the condition, output \"NO\" (without quotes).Otherwise, output \"YES\" (without quotes). Then, output $$$n$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain a binary string $$$t_i$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The $$$j$$$-th character of $$$t_i$$$ is0if cell $$$(i, j)$$$ is deleted, and1otherwise.If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.You can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yEs\", \"yes\" and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput42 210014 311100101101001115 501111101111101111101111105 21000001111011110111101111OutputYES 01 11 YES 0011 1111 1111 1100 NO YES 01111 11000 10000 10000 10000NoteFor the first test case, you only have to delete cell $$$(1, 1)$$$.For the second test case, you could choose to delete cells $$$(1,1)$$$, $$$(1,2)$$$, $$$(4,3)$$$ and $$$(4,4)$$$.For the third test case, it is no solution because the cells in the diagonal will always form a strictly increasing sequence of length $$$5$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5872b315", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a grid of cells.
