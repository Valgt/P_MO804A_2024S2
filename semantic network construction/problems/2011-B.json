Shuffletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYes, this is another one of those constructive permutation problems.You are given an integer $$$n$$$. You have to construct a permutation $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$, i. e. an array of $$$n$$$ integers, where every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once.Every pair ofadjacentelements in the permutation ($$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$) must meet the following condition:if one of them is divisible by the other, the condition $$$p_i < p_{i+1}$$$ must hold;otherwise, the condition $$$p_i > p_{i+1}$$$ must hold.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 99$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line, containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer as follows:if no permutation of size $$$n$$$ meeting the conditions from the statement exists, print $$$-1$$$;otherwise, print $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ — the required permutation. If there are mutliple answers, print any of them.ExampleInput2510Output1 5 2 4 3 1 2 10 9 7 4 8 3 6 5", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "fa2f79a2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$.
