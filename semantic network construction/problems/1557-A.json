Ezzat and Two Subsequencestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEzzat has an array of $$$n$$$ integers(maybe negative). He wants to split it into twonon-emptysubsequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, such that every element from the array belongs to exactly one subsequence, and the value of $$$f(a) + f(b)$$$ is the maximum possible value, where $$$f(x)$$$ is the average of the subsequence $$$x$$$.A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.The average of a subsequence is the sum of the numbers of this subsequence divided by the size of the subsequence.For example, the average of $$$[1,5,6]$$$ is $$$(1+5+6)/3 = 12/3 = 4$$$, so $$$f([1,5,6]) = 4$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3$$$)— the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3\\\\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single value — the maximum value that Ezzat can achieve.Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\\\\frac{|a - b|}{\\\\max{(1, |b|)}} \\\\le 10^{-6}$$$.ExampleInput4 3 3 1 2 3 -7 -6 -6 3 2 2 2 4 17 3 5 -3Output4.500000000 -12.500000000 4.000000000 18.666666667NoteIn the first test case, the array is $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$. These are all the possible ways to split this array:$$$a = [3]$$$, $$$b = [1,2]$$$, so the value of $$$f(a) + f(b) = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5$$$.$$$a = [3,1]$$$, $$$b = [2]$$$, so the value of $$$f(a) + f(b) = 2 + 2 = 4$$$.$$$a = [3,2]$$$, $$$b = [1]$$$, so the value of $$$f(a) + f(b) = 2.5 + 1 = 3.5$$$.Therefore, the maximum possible value $$$4.5$$$.In the second test case, the array is $$$[-7, -6, -6]$$$. These are all the possible ways to split this array:$$$a = [-7]$$$, $$$b = [-6,-6]$$$, so the value of $$$f(a) + f(b) = (-7) + (-6) = -13$$$.$$$a = [-7,-6]$$$, $$$b = [-6]$$$, so the value of $$$f(a) + f(b) = (-6.5) + (-6) = -12.5$$$.Therefore, the maximum possible value $$$-12.5$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1bbc4de4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
