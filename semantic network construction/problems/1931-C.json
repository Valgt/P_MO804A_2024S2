Make Equal Againtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers.You canno more than onceapply the following operation: select three integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le j \\\\le n$$$) and assign all elements of the array with indexes from $$$i$$$ to $$$j$$$ the value $$$x$$$. The price of this operation depends on the selected indices and is equal to $$$(j - i + 1)$$$ burles.For example, the array is equal to $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]$$$. If we choose $$$i = 2, j = 4, x = 8$$$, then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to $$$[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1]$$$.What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements of the array equal?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$) — the size of the array.The second line of the description of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$) — array elements.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be shown that this can always be done.ExampleInput861 2 3 4 5 171 1 1 1 1 1 188 8 8 1 2 8 8 81121 231 2 374 3 2 7 1 1 399 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3Output4 0 2 0 1 2 6 7", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "dcb0a90f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
