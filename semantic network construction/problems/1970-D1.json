Arithmancy (Easy)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputProfessor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to prepare $$$n$$$ distinctmagic wordsfor the class. Each magic word is a string consisting of charactersXandO. Aspellis a string created by concatenating two magic words together. Thepowerof a spell is equal to the number of its different non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spellXOXOis equal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings:X,O,XO,OX,XOX,OXOandXOXO.Each student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words. Since the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of the two words independently and uniformly at random from the $$$n$$$ words provided by Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a student chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of their spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work, and of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out which two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.Your program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create $$$n$$$ distinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the spell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the correct order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.InteractionThis is an interactive problem.First, your program should read a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3$$$), the number of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print $$$n$$$ magic words it has created, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must have at least 1 and at most $$$30\\\\cdot n$$$ characters, and each character must be eitherXorO. We will denote the $$$i$$$-th magic word you printed as $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$$$).Then, your program should read a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 1000$$$), the number of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process $$$q$$$ times, one per student.For the $$$j$$$-th student, it should first read a single integer $$$p_j$$$, the power of their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two indices $$$u_j$$$ and $$$v_j$$$ independently and uniformly at random between 1 and $$$n$$$ inclusive, concatenating $$$w_{u_j}$$$ and $$$w_{v_j}$$$, and finding the number of different non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program must print the numbers $$$u_j$$$ and $$$v_j$$$, in this order ($$$1 \\\\le u_j, v_j \\\\le n$$$).Note that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a spell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student in the exact order.Remember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after printing $$$u_j$$$ and $$$v_j$$$ for each student.ExampleInput2   2 15  11OutputXOXO X   1 1  2 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "77a6a39d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$ representing the number of magic words. \n\n**Step 1: Generate Magic Words**\n\n* Create $n$ distinct magic words. \n* Each magic word consists only of the characters 'X' and 'O'.\n* Each magic word must have at least 1 and at most $30*n$ characters.\n\n**Step 2: Process Student Spells**\n\n* You will be given an integer $q$ representing the number of students.\n* For each student:\n    * Read an integer $p_j$ representing the power of their spell.\n    * Determine the two magic words ($w_{u_j}$ and $w_{v_j}$) used to create the spell and their order.\n    * Print the indices $u_j$ and $v_j$ (in that order).\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* The power of a spell is the number of its different non-empty substrings.\n* Students choose the two magic words randomly and independently.\n* You must find the *exact* magic words used by each student in the *exact* order they were concatenated.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like help with any specific part of the problem!"}, {"prompt_md5": "6886eae2", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a set of words.
