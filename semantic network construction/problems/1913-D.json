Array Collapsetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$[p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n]$$$, where all elements are distinct.You can perform several (possibly zero) operations with it. In one operation, you can choose acontiguous subsegmentof $$$p$$$ and removeallelements from that subsegment,except forthe minimum element on that subsegment. For example, if $$$p = [3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 2, 6]$$$ and you choose the subsegment from the $$$3$$$-rd element to the $$$6$$$-th element, the resulting array is $$$[3, 1, 2, 6]$$$.An array $$$a$$$ is calledreachableif it can be obtained from $$$p$$$ using several (maybe zero) aforementioned operations. Calculate the number ofreachablearrays, and print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines.
