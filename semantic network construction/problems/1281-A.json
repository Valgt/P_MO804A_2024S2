Suffix Threetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWe just discovered a new data structure in our research group: asuffix three!It's very useful for natural language processing. Given three languages and three suffixes, a suffix three can determine which language a sentence is written in.It's super simple, 100% accurate, and doesn't involve advanced machine learning algorithms.Let us tell you how it works.If a sentence ends with \"po\" the language is Filipino.If a sentence ends with \"desu\" or \"masu\" the language is Japanese.If a sentence ends with \"mnida\" the language is Korean.Given this, we need you to implement a suffix three that can differentiate Filipino, Japanese, and Korean.Oh, did I say three suffixes? I meant four.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 30$$$) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of the test cases.Each test case consists of a single line containing a single string denoting the sentence. Spaces are represented as underscores (the symbol \"_\") for ease of reading. The sentence has at least $$$1$$$ and at most $$$1000$$$ characters, and consists only of lowercase English letters and underscores. The sentence has no leading or trailing underscores and no two consecutive underscores. It is guaranteed that the sentence ends with one of the four suffixes mentioned above.OutputFor each test case, print a single line containing either \"FILIPINO\", \"JAPANESE\", or \"KOREAN\" (all in uppercase, without quotes), depending on the detected language.ExampleInput8 kamusta_po genki_desu ohayou_gozaimasu annyeong_hashimnida hajime_no_ippo bensamu_no_sentou_houhou_ga_okama_kenpo ang_halaman_doon_ay_sarisari_singkamasu si_roy_mustang_ay_namamasuOutputFILIPINO JAPANESE JAPANESE KOREAN FILIPINO FILIPINO JAPANESE JAPANESENoteThe first sentence ends with \"po\", so it is written in Filipino.The second and third sentences end with \"desu\" and \"masu\", so they are written in Japanese.The fourth sentence ends with \"mnida\", so it is written in Korean.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "08121dec", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Determine the language of a sentence based on its ending. \n\n* \"po\" means Filipino\n* \"desu\" or \"masu\" means Japanese\n* \"mnida\" means Korean \n\n\nYou will be given multiple sentences, determine the language of each one."}, {"prompt_md5": "bb3c59af", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sentence in lowercase English letters and underscores.
