Japanese Crosswords Strike Backtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA one-dimensional Japanese crossword can be represented as a binary string of lengthx. An encoding of this crossword is an arrayaof sizen, wherenis the number of segments formed completely of1's, andaiis the length ofi-th segment. No two segments touch or intersect.For example:Ifx= 6and the crossword is111011, then its encoding is an array{3, 2};Ifx= 8and the crossword is01101010, then its encoding is an array{2, 1, 1};Ifx= 5and the crossword is11111, then its encoding is an array{5};Ifx= 5and the crossword is00000, then its encoding is an empty array.Mishka wants to create a new one-dimensional Japanese crossword. He has already picked the length and the encoding for this crossword. And now he needs to check if there isexactly onecrossword such that its length and encoding are equal to the length and encoding he picked. Help him to check it!InputThe first line contains two integer numbersnandx(1 ≤n≤ 100000,1 ≤x≤ 109) — the number of elements in the encoding and the length of the crossword Mishka picked.The second line containsninteger numbersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 10000) — the encoding.OutputPrintYESif there existsexaclty onecrossword with chosen length and encoding.
