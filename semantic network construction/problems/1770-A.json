Koxia and Whiteboardstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKiyora has $$$n$$$ whiteboards numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Initially, the $$$i$$$-th whiteboard has the integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it.Koxia performs $$$m$$$ operations. The $$$j$$$-th operation is to choose one of the whiteboards and change the integer written on it to $$$b_j$$$.Find the maximum possible sum of integers written on the whiteboards after performing all $$$m$$$ operations.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n,m \\\\le 100$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible sum of integers written on whiteboards after performing all $$$m$$$ operations.ExampleInput43 21 2 34 52 31 23 4 51 110015 31 1 1 1 11000000000 1000000000 1000000000Output12 9 1 3000000002NoteIn the first test case, Koxia can perform the operations as follows:Choose the $$$1$$$-st whiteboard and rewrite the integer written on it to $$$b_1=4$$$.Choose the $$$2$$$-nd whiteboard and rewrite to $$$b_2=5$$$.After performing all operations, the numbers on the three whiteboards are $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$ and $$$3$$$ respectively, and their sum is $$$12$$$. It can be proven that this is the maximum possible sum achievable.In the second test case, Koxia can perform the operations as follows:Choose the $$$2$$$-nd whiteboard and rewrite to $$$b_1=3$$$.Choose the $$$1$$$-st whiteboard and rewrite to $$$b_2=4$$$.Choose the $$$2$$$-nd whiteboard and rewrite to $$$b_3=5$$$.The sum is $$$4 + 5 = 9$$$.
