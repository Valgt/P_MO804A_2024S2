Submarine in the Rybinsk Sea (easy edition)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis problem differs from the next one only in the presence of the constraint on the equal length of all numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$. Actually, this problem is a subtask of the problem D2 from the same contest and the solution of D2 solves this subtask too.A team of SIS students is going to make a trip on a submarine. Their target is an ancient treasure in a sunken ship lying on the bottom of the Great Rybinsk sea. Unfortunately, the students don't know the coordinates of the ship, so they asked Meshanya (who is a hereditary mage) to help them. He agreed to help them, but only if they solve his problem.Let's denote a function that alternates digits of two numbers $$$f(a_1 a_2 \\\\dots a_{p - 1} a_p, b_1 b_2 \\\\dots b_{q - 1} b_q)$$$, where $$$a_1 \\\\dots a_p$$$ and $$$b_1 \\\\dots b_q$$$ are digits of two integers written in the decimal notation without leading zeros.In other words, the function $$$f(x, y)$$$ alternately shuffles the digits of the numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ by writing them from the lowest digits to the older ones, starting with the number $$$y$$$. The result of the function is also built from right to left (that is, from the lower digits to the older ones). If the digits of one of the arguments have ended, then the remaining digits of the other argument are written out. Familiarize with examples and formal definitions of the function below.For example: $$$$$$f(1111, 2222) = 12121212$$$$$$ $$$$$$f(7777, 888) = 7787878$$$$$$ $$$$$$f(33, 44444) = 4443434$$$$$$ $$$$$$f(555, 6) = 5556$$$$$$ $$$$$$f(111, 2222) = 2121212$$$$$$Formally,if $$$p \\\\ge q$$$ then $$$f(a_1 \\\\dots a_p, b_1 \\\\dots b_q) = a_1 a_2 \\\\dots a_{p - q + 1} b_1 a_{p - q + 2} b_2 \\\\dots a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q$$$;if $$$p < q$$$ then $$$f(a_1 \\\\dots a_p, b_1 \\\\dots b_q) = b_1 b_2 \\\\dots b_{q - p} a_1 b_{q - p + 1} a_2 \\\\dots a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q$$$.Mishanya gives you an array consisting of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$.All numbers in this array are of equal length (that is, they consist of the same number of digits).Your task is to help students to calculate $$$\\\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\\\sum_{j = 1}^{n} f(a_i, a_j)$$$ modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$) — the number of elements in the array. The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. All numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ are of equal length (that is, they consist of the same number of digits).OutputPrint the answer modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.ExamplesInput3 12 33 45Output26730Input2 123 456Output1115598Input1 1Output11Input5 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000Output265359409", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2490d92f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, where all integers have the same number of digits.  \n\nYour task is to calculate the following sum modulo 998244353:\n\n$$\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\sum_{j = 1}^{n} f(a_i, a_j)$$\n\nwhere the function $f$ works as follows:\n\n*  Let $a_1 a_2 ... a_p$ and $b_1 b_2 ... b_q$ represent the digits of two integers $a_i$ and $a_j$ respectively.\n\n* If $p \\ge q$, then $f(a_1 a_2 ... a_p, b_1 b_2 ... b_q) = a_1 a_2 ... a_{p-q+1} b_1 a_{p-q+2} b_2 ... a_{p-1} b_q$\n\n* If $p < q$, then $f(a_1 a_2 ... a_p, b_1 b_2 ... b_q) = b_1 b_2 ... b_{q-p} a_1 b_{q-p+1} a_2 ... a_{p-1} b_{q-1} a_p b_q$\n\n\n\nIn essence, the function $f$ interleaves the digits of the two input numbers."}, {"prompt_md5": "6df6fc68", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given an array of numbers of equal length.
