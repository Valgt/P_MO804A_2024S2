Opposites Attracttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutEverybody knows that opposites attract. That is the key principle of the \"Perfect Matching\" dating agency. The \"Perfect Matching\" matchmakers have classified each registered customer by his interests and assigned to thei-th client numberti(- 10 ≤ti≤ 10). Of course, one number can be assigned to any number of customers.\"Perfect Matching\" wants to advertise its services and publish the number of opposite couples, that is, the couples who have opposite values oft. Each couple consists of exactly two clients. The customer can be included in a couple an arbitrary number of times. Help the agency and write the program that will find the sought number by the given sequencet1,t2, ...,tn. For example, ift= (1,  - 1, 1,  - 1), then any two elementstiandtjform a couple ifiandjhave different parity. Consequently, in this case the sought number equals 4.Of course, a client can't form a couple with him/herself.InputThe first line of the input data contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 105) which represents the number of registered clients of the \"Couple Matching\". The second line contains a sequence of integerst1,t2, ...,tn(- 10 ≤ti≤ 10),ti— is the parameter of thei-th customer that has been assigned to the customer by the result of the analysis of his interests.OutputPrint the number of couples of customs with oppositet. The opposite number forxis number-x(0is opposite to itself). Couples that only differ in the clients' order are considered the same.Note that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.ExamplesInput5-3 3 0 0 3Output3Input30 0 0Output3NoteIn the first sample the couples of opposite clients are:(1,2), (1,5) и (3,4).In the second sample any couple of clients is opposite.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "3606e2cb", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of integers $t_1, t_2, ..., t_n$ where each integer represents a client's interest level.  \n\nTwo clients form a \"couple\" if their interest levels are opposites (e.g., 1 and -1, 3 and -3).  \n\nFind the total number of couples that can be formed from this sequence.  \n\n**Note:**\n\n* A client cannot be in a couple with themselves.\n* The order of clients in a couple does not matter (e.g., (1, -1) is the same couple as (-1, 1))."}, {"prompt_md5": "505cb666", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers.
