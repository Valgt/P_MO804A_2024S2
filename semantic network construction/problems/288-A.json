Polo the Penguin and Stringstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLittle penguin Polo adores strings. But most of all he adores strings of lengthn.One day he wanted to find a string that meets the following conditions:The string consists ofnlowercase English letters (that is, the string's length equalsn), exactlykof these letters are distinct.No two neighbouring letters of a string coincide; that is, if we represent a string ass=s1s2...sn, then the following inequality holds,si≠si+ 1(1 ≤i<n).Among all strings that meet points 1 and 2, the required string is lexicographically smallest.Help him find such string or state that such string doesn't exist.Stringx=x1x2...xpislexicographically lessthan stringy=y1y2...yq, if eitherp<qandx1=y1,x2=y2, ... ,xp=yp, or there is such numberr(r<p,r<q), thatx1=y1,x2=y2, ... ,xr=yrandxr+ 1<yr+ 1. The characters of the strings are compared by their ASCII codes.InputA single line contains two positive integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 106, 1 ≤k≤ 26)— the string's length and the number of distinct letters.OutputIn a single line print the required string. If there isn't such string, print \"-1\" (without the quotes).ExamplesInput7 4OutputababacdInput4 7Output-1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "aac0071f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an integer $n$ and an integer $k$ (where $1 \\le n \\le 10^6$ and $1 \\le k \\le 26$), find the lexicographically smallest string of length $n$ that contains exactly $k$ distinct lowercase English letters, with no two adjacent letters being the same. \n\nIf no such string exists, print \"-1\"."}, {"prompt_md5": "80f5144e", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Find the lexicographically smallest string of a given length with a specific number of unique characters, where no two adjacent characters are the same.
