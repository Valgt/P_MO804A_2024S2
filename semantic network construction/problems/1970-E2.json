Trails (Medium)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputHarry Potter is hiking in the Alps surrounding Lake Geneva. In this area there are $$$m$$$ cabins, numbered 1 to $$$m$$$. Each cabin is connected, with one or more trails, to a central meeting point next to the lake. Each trail is eithershortorlong. Cabin $$$i$$$ is connected with $$$s_i$$$ short trails and $$$l_i$$$ long trails to the lake.Each day, Harry walks a trail from the cabin where he currently is to Lake Geneva, and then from there he walks a trail to any of the $$$m$$$ cabins (including the one he started in). However, as he has to finish the hike in a day, at least one of the two trails has to be short.How many possible combinations of trails can Harry take if he starts in cabin 1 and walks for $$$n$$$ days?Give the answer modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.InputThe first line contains the integers $$$m$$$ and $$$n$$$.The second line contains $$$m$$$ integers, $$$s_1, \\\\dots, s_m$$$, where $$$s_i$$$ is the number of short trails between cabin $$$i$$$ and Lake Geneva.The third and last line contains $$$m$$$ integers, $$$l_1, \\\\dots, l_m$$$, where $$$l_i$$$ is the number of long trails between cabin $$$i$$$ and Lake Geneva.We have the following constraints:$$$0 \\\\le s_i, l_i \\\\le 10^3$$$.$$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 10^2$$$.$$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$.OutputThe number of possible combinations of trails, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExampleInput3 21 0 10 1 1Output18", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "3a10ca63", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You have $m$ locations.
