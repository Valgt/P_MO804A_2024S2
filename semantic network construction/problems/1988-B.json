Make Majoritytime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a sequence $$$[a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n]$$$ where each element $$$a_i$$$ is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. You can apply several (possibly zero) operations to the sequence. In each operation, you select two integers $$$1\\\\le l\\\\le r\\\\le |a|$$$ (where $$$|a|$$$ is the current length of $$$a$$$) and replace $$$[a_l,\\\\ldots,a_r]$$$ with a single element $$$x$$$, where $$$x$$$ is the majority of $$$[a_l,\\\\ldots,a_r]$$$.Here, the majority of a sequence consisting of $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ is defined as follows: suppose there are $$$c_0$$$ zeros and $$$c_1$$$ ones in the sequence, respectively.If $$$c_0\\\\ge c_1$$$, the majority is $$$0$$$.If $$$c_0<c_1$$$, the majority is $$$1$$$.For example, suppose $$$a=[1,0,0,0,1,1]$$$. If we select $$$l=1,r=2$$$, the resulting sequence will be $$$[0,0,0,1,1]$$$. If we select $$$l=4,r=6$$$, the resulting sequence will be $$$[1,0,0,1]$$$.Determine if you can make $$$a=[1]$$$ with a finite number of operations.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 4\\\\cdot 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each testcase contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n\\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each testcase contains a string consisting of $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$, describing the sequence $$$a$$$.It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, if it's possible to make $$$a=[1]$$$, printYES. Otherwise, printNO. You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the stringsyEs,yes,Yes, andYESwill be recognized as positive responses.ExampleInput5101120191000000019000011000OutputNo Yes No Yes NoNoteIn the fourth testcase of the example, initially $$$a=[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]$$$. A valid sequence of operations is:Select $$$l=2,r=8$$$ and apply the operation. $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[1,0,1]$$$.Select $$$l=1,r=3$$$ and apply the operation. $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[1]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f549c4a1", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a sequence of 0s and 1s.
