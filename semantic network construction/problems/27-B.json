Tournamenttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe tournament «Sleepyhead-2010» in the rapid falling asleep has just finished in Berland.nbest participants from the country have participated in it. The tournament consists of games, each of them is a match between two participants.n·(n- 1) / 2games were played during the tournament, and each participant had a match with each other participant.The rules of the game are quite simple — the participant who falls asleep first wins. The secretary made a record of each game in the form «xiyi», wherexiandyiare the numbers of participants. The first number in each pair is a winner (i.e.xiis a winner andyiis a loser). There is no draws.Recently researches form the «Institute Of Sleep» have found that every person is characterized by a valuepj— the speed of falling asleep. The person who has lower speed wins. Every person has its own valuepj, constant during the life.It is known that all participants of the tournament have distinct speeds of falling asleep. Also it was found that the secretary made records about all the games except one. You are to find the result of the missing game.InputThe first line contains one integern(3 ≤n≤ 50) — the number of participants. The followingn·(n- 1) / 2 - 1lines contain the results of the games. Each game is described in a single line by two integersxi,yi(1 ≤xi,yi≤n,xi≠yi), wherexiиyiare the numbers of the opponents in this game. It is known that during the tournament each of thenparticipants playedn- 1games, one game with each other participant.OutputOutput two integersxandy— the missing record.
