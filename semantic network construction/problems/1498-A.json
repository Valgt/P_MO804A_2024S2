GCD Sumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe $$$\\\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}$$$ of a positive integer is the $$$gcd$$$ of that integer with its sum of digits. Formally, $$$\\\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(x) = gcd(x, \\\\text{ sum of digits of } x)$$$ for a positive integer $$$x$$$. $$$gcd(a, b)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ — the largest integer $$$d$$$ such that both integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are divisible by $$$d$$$.For example: $$$\\\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(762) = gcd(762, 7 + 6 + 2)=gcd(762,15) = 3$$$.Given an integer $$$n$$$, find the smallest integer $$$x \\\\ge n$$$ such that $$$\\\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(x) > 1$$$.InputThe first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4)$$$ — the number of test cases.Then $$$t$$$ lines follow, each containing a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{18})$$$.All test cases in one test are different.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ lines, where the $$$i$$$-th line is a single integer containing the answer to the $$$i$$$-th test case.ExampleInput3 11 31 75Output12 33 75NoteLet us explain the three test cases in the sample.Test case 1:$$$n = 11$$$:$$$\\\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(11) = gcd(11, 1 + 1) = gcd(11,\\\\ 2) = 1$$$.$$$\\\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(12) = gcd(12, 1 + 2) = gcd(12,\\\\ 3) = 3$$$.So the smallest number $$$\\\\ge 11$$$ whose $$$gcdSum$$$ $$$> 1$$$ is $$$12$$$.Test case 2:$$$n = 31$$$:$$$\\\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(31) = gcd(31, 3 + 1) = gcd(31,\\\\ 4) = 1$$$.$$$\\\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(32) = gcd(32, 3 + 2) = gcd(32,\\\\ 5) = 1$$$.$$$\\\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(33) = gcd(33, 3 + 3) = gcd(33,\\\\ 6) = 3$$$.So the smallest number $$$\\\\ge 31$$$ whose $$$gcdSum$$$ $$$> 1$$$ is $$$33$$$.Test case 3:$$$\\\\ n = 75$$$:$$$\\\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(75) = gcd(75, 7 + 5) = gcd(75,\\\\ 12) = 3$$$.The $$$\\\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}$$$ of $$$75$$$ is already $$$> 1$$$.
