Array Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. In one operation, you must pick some $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$1\\\\leq i < j\\\\leq |a|$$$ and append $$$|a_i - a_j|$$$ to the end of the $$$a$$$ (i.e. increase $$$n$$$ by $$$1$$$ and set $$$a_n$$$ to $$$|a_i - a_j|$$$). Your task is to minimize and print the minimum value of $$$a$$$ after performing $$$k$$$ operations.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2\\\\le n\\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^3$$$, $$$1\\\\le k\\\\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array and the number of operations you should perform.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le a_i\\\\le 10^{18}$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4\\\\cdot 10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the smallest possible value of the minimum of array $$$a$$$ after performing $$$k$$$ operations.ExampleInput45 23 9 7 15 14 37 4 15 126 242 47 50 54 62 792 1500000000000000000 1000000000000000000Output1 0 3 500000000000000000NoteIn the first test case, after any $$$k=2$$$ operations, the minimum value of $$$a$$$ will be $$$1$$$.In the second test case, an optimal strategy is to first pick $$$i=1, j=2$$$ and append $$$|a_1 - a_2| = 3$$$ to the end of $$$a$$$, creating $$$a=[7, 4, 15, 12, 3]$$$. Then, pick $$$i=3, j=4$$$ and append $$$|a_3 - a_4| = 3$$$ to the end of $$$a$$$, creating $$$a=[7, 4, 15, 12, 3, 3]$$$. In the final operation, pick $$$i=5, j=6$$$ and append $$$|a_5 - a_6| = 0$$$ to the end of $$$a$$$. Then the minimum value of $$$a$$$ will be $$$0$$$.In the third test case, an optimal strategy is to first pick $$$i=2, j=3$$$ to append $$$|a_2 - a_3| = 3$$$ to the end of $$$a$$$. Any second operation will still not make the minimum value of $$$a$$$ be less than $$$3$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a98293fc", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ positive integers.
