Tenzing and Necklacetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputbright, sunny and innocent......Tenzing has a beautiful necklace. The necklace consists of $$$n$$$ pearls numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ with a string connecting pearls $$$i$$$ and $$$(i \\\\text{ mod } n)+1$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$.One day Tenzing wants to cut the necklace into several parts by cutting some strings. But for each connected part of the necklace, there should not be more than $$$k$$$ pearls. The time needed to cut each string may not be the same. Tenzing needs to spend $$$a_i$$$ minutes cutting the string between pearls $$$i$$$ and $$$(i \\\\text{ mod } n)+1$$$.Tenzing wants to know the minimum time in minutes to cut the necklace such that each connected part will not have more than $$$k$$$ pearls.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2\\\\leq n\\\\leq 5\\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\\\leq k <n$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq a_i\\\\leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ of all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum total time in minutes required.ExampleInput45 21 1 1 1 15 21 2 3 4 56 34 2 5 1 3 310 32 5 6 5 2 1 7 9 7 2Output3 7 5 15NoteIn the first test case, the necklace will be cut into $$$3$$$ parts: $$$[1,2][3,4][5]$$$, so the total time is $$$3$$$.In the second test case, the necklace will be cut into $$$3$$$ parts: $$$[5,1][2][3,4]$$$, Tenzing will cut the strings connecting $$$(1,2), (2,3)$$$ and $$$(4,5)$$$, so the total time is $$$a_1+a_2+a_4=7$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c2c63e9e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a necklace with $n$ pearls numbered from 1 to $n$.
