Districts Connectiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ districts in the town, the $$$i$$$-th district belongs to the $$$a_i$$$-th bandit gang. Initially, no districts are connected to each other.You are the mayor of the city and want to build $$$n-1$$$ two-way roads to connect all districts (two districts can be connected directly or through other connected districts).If two districts belonging to the same gang are connecteddirectlywith a road, this gang will revolt.You don't want this so your task is to build $$$n-1$$$ two-way roads in such a way that all districts are reachable from each other (possibly, using intermediate districts) andeach pairof directly connected districts belong todifferent gangs, or determine that it is impossible to build $$$n-1$$$ roads to satisfy all the conditions.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 5000$$$) — the number of districts. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the gang the $$$i$$$-th district belongs to.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$5000$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 5000$$$).OutputFor each test case, print:NOon the only line if it is impossible to connect all districts satisfying the conditions from the problem statement.YESon the first line and $$$n-1$$$ roads on the next $$$n-1$$$ lines. Each road should be presented as a pair of integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le n; x_i \\\\ne y_i$$$), where $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ are two districts the $$$i$$$-th road connects.For each road $$$i$$$, the condition $$$a[x_i] \\\\ne a[y_i]$$$ should be satisfied. Also, all districts should be reachable from each other (possibly, using intermediate districts).ExampleInput4 5 1 2 2 1 3 3 1 1 1 4 1 1000 101 1000 4 1 2 3 4OutputYES 1 3 3 5 5 4 1 2 NO YES 1 2 2 3 3 4 YES 1 2 1 3 1 4", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2a14dd58", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a set of cities, each belonging to one of several groups.
