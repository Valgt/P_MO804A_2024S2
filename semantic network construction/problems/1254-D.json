Tree Queriestime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputHanh is a famous biologist. He loves growing trees and doing experiments on his own garden.One day, he got a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. Vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. A tree with $$$n$$$ vertices is an undirected connected graph with $$$n-1$$$ edges. Initially, Hanh sets the value of every vertex to $$$0$$$.Now, Hanh performs $$$q$$$ operations, each is either of the following types:Type $$$1$$$: Hanh selects a vertex $$$v$$$ and an integer $$$d$$$. Then he chooses some vertex $$$r$$$uniformly at random, lists all vertices $$$u$$$ such that the path from $$$r$$$ to $$$u$$$ passes through $$$v$$$. Hanh then increases the value of all such vertices $$$u$$$ by $$$d$$$.Type $$$2$$$: Hanh selects a vertex $$$v$$$ and calculates the expected value of $$$v$$$.Since Hanh is good at biology but not math, he needs your help on these operations.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, q \\\\leq 150\\\\,000$$$) — the number of vertices on Hanh's tree and the number of operations he performs.Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq u, v \\\\leq n$$$), denoting that there is an edge connecting two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that these $$$n - 1$$$ edges form a tree.Each of the last $$$q$$$ lines describes an operation in either formats:$$$1$$$ $$$v$$$ $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq v \\\\leq n, 0 \\\\leq d \\\\leq 10^7$$$), representing a first-type operation.$$$2$$$ $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq v \\\\leq n$$$), representing a second-type operation.It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of the second type.OutputFor each operation of the second type, write the expected value on a single line.Let $$$M = 998244353$$$, it can be shown that the expected value can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\\\not \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\\\cdot q^{-1} \\\\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\\\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\\\cdot q \\\\equiv p \\\\pmod{M}$$$.ExampleInput5 12 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 5 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 5Output1 199648871 399297742 199648871 199648871 598946614 199648873 2 2 2NoteThe image below shows the tree in the example:For the first query, where $$$v = 1$$$ and $$$d = 1$$$:If $$$r = 1$$$, the values of all vertices get increased.If $$$r = 2$$$, the values of vertices $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ get increased.If $$$r = 3$$$, the values of vertices $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ get increased.If $$$r = 4$$$, the values of vertices $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ get increased.If $$$r = 5$$$, the values of vertices $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ get increased.Hence, the expected values of all vertices after this query are ($$$1, 0.4, 0.8, 0.4, 0.4$$$).For the second query, where $$$v = 2$$$ and $$$d = 2$$$:If $$$r = 1$$$, the values of vertices $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ get increased.If $$$r = 2$$$, the values of all vertices get increased.If $$$r = 3$$$, the values of vertices $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ get increased.If $$$r = 4$$$, the values of vertices $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ get increased.If $$$r = 5$$$, the values of vertices $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ get increased.Hence, the expected values of all vertices after this query are ($$$2.2, 2.4, 2, 2, 2$$$).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5b20e720", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ vertices.
