Maximize the Remaining Stringtime limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. While there is at least one character in the string $$$s$$$ that isrepeated at least twice, you perform the following operation:you choose the index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le |s|$$$) such that the character at position $$$i$$$ occursat least twotimes in the string $$$s$$$, and delete the character at position $$$i$$$, that is, replace $$$s$$$ with $$$s_1 s_2 \\\\ldots s_{i-1} s_{i+1} s_{i+2} \\\\ldots s_n$$$.For example, if $$$s=$$$\"codeforces\", then you can apply the following sequence of operations:$$$i=6 \\\\Rightarrow s=$$$\"codefrces\";$$$i=1 \\\\Rightarrow s=$$$\"odefrces\";$$$i=7 \\\\Rightarrow s=$$$\"odefrcs\";Given a given string $$$s$$$, find the lexicographically maximum string that can be obtained after applying a certain sequence of operations after which all characters in the stringbecome unique.A string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is lexicographically less than a string $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$, if:there is an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le \\\\min(n, m)$$$) such that the first $$$i-1$$$ characters of the strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are the same, and the $$$i$$$-th character of the string $$$a$$$ is less than $$$i$$$-th character of string $$$b$$$;orthe first $$$\\\\min(n, m)$$$ characters in the strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are the same and $$$n < m$$$.For example, the string $$$a=$$$\"aezakmi\"is lexicographically less than the string $$$b=$$$\"aezus\".InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case is characterized by a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of the strings in all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the lexicographically maximum string that can be obtained after applying a certain sequence of operations after which all characters in the stringbecome unique.ExampleInput6 codeforces aezakmi abacaba convexhull swflldjgpaxs myneeocktxpqjpzOutputodfrces ezakmi cba convexhul wfldjgpaxs myneocktxqjpz", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b8d115b2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string of lowercase letters.
