Points in Segmentstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a set of $$$n$$$ segments on the axis $$$Ox$$$, each segment has integer endpoints between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$ inclusive. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. Each segment is characterized by two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le m$$$) — coordinates of the left and of the right endpoints.Consider all integer points between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$ inclusive. Your task is to print all such points that don't belong to any segment. The point $$$x$$$ belongs to the segment $$$[l; r]$$$ if and only if $$$l \\\\le x \\\\le r$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of segments and the upper bound for coordinates.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers each $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l_i \\\\le r_i \\\\le m$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th segment. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. Note, it is possible that $$$l_i=r_i$$$, i.e. a segment can degenerate to a point.OutputIn the first line print one integer $$$k$$$ — the number of points that don't belong to any segment.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ integers inanyorder — the points that don't belong to any segment. All points you print should be distinct.If there are no such points at all, print a single integer $$$0$$$ in the first line and either leave the second line empty or do not print it at all.ExamplesInput3 52 21 25 5Output23 4Input1 71 7Output0NoteIn the first example the point $$$1$$$ belongs to the second segment, the point $$$2$$$ belongs to the first and the second segments and the point $$$5$$$ belongs to the third segment.
