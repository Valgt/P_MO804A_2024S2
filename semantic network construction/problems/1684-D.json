Trapstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ traps numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. You will go through them one by one in order. The $$$i$$$-th trap deals $$$a_i$$$ base damage to you.Instead of going through a trap, you can jump it over. You can jump over no more than $$$k$$$ traps. If you jump over a trap, it does not deal any damage to you. But there is an additional rule: if you jump over a trap, all next traps damages increase by $$$1$$$ (this is a bonus damage).Note that if you jump over a trap, you don't get any damage (neither base damage nor bonus damage). Also, the bonus damage stacks so, for example, if you go through a trap $$$i$$$ with base damage $$$a_i$$$, and you have already jumped over $$$3$$$ traps, you get $$$(a_i + 3)$$$ damage.You have to find the minimal damage that it is possible to get if you are allowed to jump over no more than $$$k$$$ traps.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$) — the number of traps and the number of jump overs that you are allowed to make.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — base damage values of all traps.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case output a single integer — the minimal total damage that it is possible to get if you are allowed to jump over no more than $$$k$$$ traps.ExampleInput54 48 7 1 44 15 10 11 57 58 2 5 15 11 2 86 31 2 3 4 5 61 17Output0 21 9 6 0NoteIn the first test case it is allowed to jump over all traps and take $$$0$$$ damage.In the second test case there are $$$5$$$ ways to jump over some traps:Do not jump over any trap.Total damage: $$$5 + 10 + 11 + 5 = 31$$$.Jump over the $$$1$$$-st trap.Total damage: $$$\\\\underline{0} + (10 + 1) + (11 + 1) + (5 + 1) = 29$$$.Jump over the $$$2$$$-nd trap.Total damage: $$$5 + \\\\underline{0} + (11 + 1) + (5 + 1) = 23$$$.Jump over the $$$3$$$-rd trap.Total damage: $$$5 + 10 + \\\\underline{0} + (5 + 1) = 21$$$.Jump over the $$$4$$$-th trap.Total damage: $$$5 + 10 + 11 + \\\\underline{0} = 26$$$.To get minimal damage it is needed to jump over the $$$3$$$-rd trap, so the answer is $$$21$$$.In the third test case it is optimal to jump over the traps $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$7$$$:Total damage: $$$0 + (2 + 1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + (2 + 4) + 0 = 9$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "491502b8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are navigating a series of $n$ traps.
