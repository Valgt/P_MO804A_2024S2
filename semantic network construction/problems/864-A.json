Fair Gametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPetya and Vasya decided to play a game. They havencards (nis an even number). A single integer is written on each card.Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (differentfrom the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number5before the game he will take all cards on which5is written and if Vasya chose number10before the game he will take all cards on which10is written.The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take allncards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair.InputThe first line contains a single integern(2 ≤n≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed thatnis an even number.The followingnlines contain a sequence of integersa1,a2, ...,an(one integer per line,1 ≤ai≤ 100) — numbers written on thencards.OutputIf it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print \"NO\" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.In the other case print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInput411272711OutputYES11 27Input266OutputNOInput6102030201020OutputNOInput6112233OutputNONoteIn the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number11, and Vasya chooses number27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards1and4, and Vasya will take cards2and3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number10and Vasya can choose number20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take6cards.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "800ccfe8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of $n$ cards, where $n$ is an even number.
