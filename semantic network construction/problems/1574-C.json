Slay the Dragontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecently, Petya learned about a new game \"Slay the Dragon\". As the name suggests, the player will have to fight with dragons. To defeat a dragon, you have to kill it and defend your castle. To do this, the player has a squad of $$$n$$$ heroes, the strength of the $$$i$$$-th hero is equal to $$$a_i$$$.According to the rules of the game, exactly one hero should go kill the dragon, all the others will defend the castle. If the dragon's defense is equal to $$$x$$$, then you have to send a hero with a strength of at least $$$x$$$ to kill it. If the dragon's attack power is $$$y$$$, then the total strength of the heroes defending the castle should be at least $$$y$$$.The player can increase the strength of any hero by $$$1$$$ for one gold coin. This operation can be done any number of times.There are $$$m$$$ dragons in the game, the $$$i$$$-th of them has defense equal to $$$x_i$$$ and attack power equal to $$$y_i$$$. Petya was wondering what is the minimum number of coins he needs to spend to defeat the $$$i$$$-th dragon.Note that the task is solvedindependently for each dragon(improvements are not saved).InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — number of heroes.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^{12}$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the strength of the $$$i$$$-th hero.The third line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of dragons.The next $$$m$$$ lines contain two integers each, $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i \\\\le 10^{12}; 1 \\\\le y_i \\\\le 10^{18}$$$) — defense and attack power of the $$$i$$$-th dragon.OutputPrint $$$m$$$ lines, $$$i$$$-th of which contains a single integer — the minimum number of coins that should be spent to defeat the $$$i$$$-th dragon.ExampleInput4 3 6 2 3 5 3 12 7 9 4 14 1 10 8 7Output1 2 4 0 2NoteTo defeat the first dragon, you can increase the strength of the third hero by $$$1$$$, then the strength of the heroes will be equal to $$$[3, 6, 3, 3]$$$. To kill the dragon, you can choose the first hero.To defeat the second dragon, you can increase the forces of the second and third heroes by $$$1$$$, then the strength of the heroes will be equal to $$$[3, 7, 3, 3]$$$. To kill the dragon, you can choose a second hero.To defeat the third dragon, you can increase the strength of all the heroes by $$$1$$$, then the strength of the heroes will be equal to $$$[4, 7, 3, 4]$$$. To kill the dragon, you can choose a fourth hero.To defeat the fourth dragon, you don't need to improve the heroes and choose a third hero to kill the dragon.To defeat the fifth dragon, you can increase the strength of the second hero by $$$2$$$, then the strength of the heroes will be equal to $$$[3, 8, 2, 3]$$$. To kill the dragon, you can choose a second hero.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "cf90b34c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have $n$ heroes, each with a strength of $a_i$.
