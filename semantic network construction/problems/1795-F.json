Blocking Chipstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree, consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. There are $$$k$$$ chips, placed in vertices $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_k$$$. All $$$a_i$$$ are distinct. Vertices $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_k$$$ are colored black initially. The remaining vertices are white.You are going to play a game where you perform some moves (possibly, zero). On the $$$i$$$-th move ($$$1$$$-indexed) you are going to move the $$$((i - 1) \\\\bmod k + 1)$$$-st chip from its current vertex to an adjacentwhitevertex and color that vertexblack. So, if $$$k=3$$$, you move chip $$$1$$$ on move $$$1$$$, chip $$$2$$$ on move $$$2$$$, chip $$$3$$$ on move $$$3$$$, chip $$$1$$$ on move $$$4$$$, chip $$$2$$$ on move $$$5$$$ and so on. If there is no adjacent white vertex, then the game ends.What's the maximum number of moves you can perform?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices of the tree.Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v, u \\\\le n$$$) — the descriptions of the edges. The given edges form a tree.The next line contains a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$) — the number of chips.The next line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$) — the vertices with the chips. All $$$a_i$$$ are distinct.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum number of moves you can perform.ExampleInput551 22 33 44 51351 22 33 44 521 251 22 33 44 522 161 21 32 42 53 631 4 6111Output2 0 1 2 0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f592f2e3", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You have a tree with some nodes marked as having chips.
