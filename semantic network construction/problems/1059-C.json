Sequence Transformationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call the following process a transformation of a sequence of length $$$n$$$.If the sequence is empty, the process ends. Otherwise, append thegreatest common divisor(GCD) of all the elements of the sequence to the result and remove one arbitrary element from the sequence. Thus, when the process ends, we have a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers: the greatest common divisors of all the elements in the sequence before each deletion.You are given an integer sequence $$$1, 2, \\\\dots, n$$$.
