Correct Solution?time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutOne cold winter evening Alice and her older brother Bob was sitting at home near the fireplace and giving each other interesting problems to solve. When it was Alice's turn, she told the numbernto Bob and said:—Shuffle the digits in this number in order to obtain the smallest possible number without leading zeroes.—No problem! — said Bob and immediately gave her an answer.Alice said a random number, so she doesn't know whether Bob's answer is correct. Help her to find this out, because impatient brother is waiting for the verdict.InputThe first line contains one integern(0 ≤n≤ 109) without leading zeroes. The second lines contains one integerm(0 ≤m≤ 109) — Bob's answer, possibly with leading zeroes.OutputPrintOKif Bob's answer is correct andWRONG_ANSWERotherwise.ExamplesInput33101033OutputOKInput45OutputWRONG_ANSWER", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6b0a15d7", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given an integer $n$, determine if the integer $m$ is the smallest possible number that can be formed by rearranging the digits of $n$ without leading zeroes. \n\nInput:\n* Line 1: An integer $n$ (0 ≤ $n$ ≤ 10⁹)\n* Line 2: An integer $m$ (0 ≤ $m$ ≤ 10⁹)\n\nOutput:\n* \"OK\" if $m$ is the smallest possible number formed by rearranging the digits of $n$.\n* \"WRONG_ANSWER\" otherwise."}, {"prompt_md5": "2030443f", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a number, determine if another number is the smallest possible number formed by rearranging its digits without leading zeros."}]}
