Bags with Ballstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ bags, each bag contains $$$m$$$ balls with numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. For every $$$i \\\\in [1, m]$$$, there is exactly one ball with number $$$i$$$ in each bag.You have to take exactly one ball from each bag (all bags are different, so, for example, taking the ball $$$1$$$ from the first bag and the ball $$$2$$$ from the second bag is not the same as taking the ball $$$2$$$ from the first bag and the ball $$$1$$$ from the second bag). After that, you calculate the number of balls withoddnumbers among the ones you have taken. Let the number of these balls be $$$F$$$.Your task is to calculate the sum of $$$F^k$$$ over all possible ways to take $$$n$$$ balls, one from each bag.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 998244352$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 2000$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the sum of $$$F^k$$$ over all possible ways to take $$$n$$$ balls, one from each bag. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExampleInput52 3 81 1 11 5 103 7 20001337666 42424242 2000Output1028 1 3 729229716 652219904", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "41cce3ef", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have $n$ bags, and each bag contains $m$ balls numbered from 1 to $m$.
