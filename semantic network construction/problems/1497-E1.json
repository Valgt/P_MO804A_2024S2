Square-Free Division (easy version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$k = 0$$$.There is an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You should divide it into a minimal number of continuous segments, such that in each segment there are no two numbers (on different positions), whose product is a perfect square.Moreover, it is allowed to do at most $$$k$$$ such operations before the division: choose a number in the array and change its value to any positive integer. But in this version $$$k = 0$$$, so it is not important.What is the minimum number of continuous segments you should use if you will make changes optimally?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000)$$$  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$k = 0$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^7$$$).It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print a single integer  — the answer to the problem.ExampleInput35 018 6 2 4 15 06 8 1 24 81 01Output3 2 1NoteIn the first test case the division may be as follows:$$$[18, 6]$$$$$$[2, 4]$$$$$$[1]$$$", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "43a4ca0a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of positive integers.
