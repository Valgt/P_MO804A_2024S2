Reverse Binary Stringstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$ of even length $$$n$$$. String $$$s$$$ is binary, in other words, consists only of0's and1's.String $$$s$$$ has exactly $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ zeroes and $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ ones ($$$n$$$ is even).In one operation you can reverse any substring of $$$s$$$. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.What is the minimum number of operations you need to make string $$$s$$$alternating? A string is alternating if $$$s_i \\\\neq s_{i + 1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$. There are two types of alternating strings in general:01010101...or10101010...InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$; $$$n$$$ is even) — the length of string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ ($$$s_i \\\\in$$$ {0,1}). String $$$s$$$ has exactly $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ zeroes and $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ ones.It's guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ over test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum number of operations to make $$$s$$$ alternating.ExampleInput3 2 10 4 0110 8 11101000Output0 1 2NoteIn the first test case, string10is already alternating.In the second test case, we can, for example, reverse the last two elements of $$$s$$$ and get:0110$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$0101.In the third test case, we can, for example, make the following two operations:11101000$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$10101100;10101100$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$10101010.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4d94fc57", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a binary string of even length $n$.
