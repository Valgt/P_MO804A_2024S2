Lonely Numberstime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn number world, two different numbers are friends if they have a lot in common, but also each one has unique perks.More precisely, two different numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are friends if $$$gcd(a,b)$$$, $$$\\\\frac{a}{gcd(a,b)}$$$, $$$\\\\frac{b}{gcd(a,b)}$$$ can form sides of a triangle.Three numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ can form sides of a triangle if $$$a + b > c$$$, $$$b + c > a$$$ and $$$c + a > b$$$.In a group of numbers, a number is lonely if it doesn't have any friends in that group.Given a group of numbers containing all numbers from $$$1, 2, 3, ..., n$$$, how many numbers in that group are lonely?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^6)$$$ - number of test cases.On next line there are $$$t$$$ numbers, $$$n_i$$$ $$$(1 \\\\leq n_i \\\\leq 10^6)$$$ - meaning that in case $$$i$$$ you should solve for numbers $$$1, 2, 3, ..., n_i$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the answer on separate lines: number of lonely numbers in group $$$1, 2, 3, ..., n_i$$$.ExampleInput3 1 5 10Output1 3 3NoteFor first test case, $$$1$$$ is the only number and therefore lonely.For second test case where $$$n=5$$$, numbers $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ are lonely.For third test case where $$$n=10$$$, numbers $$$1$$$, $$$5$$$ and $$$7$$$ are lonely.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e7aca93e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Two numbers are friends if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the two numbers, and the two quotients obtained by dividing each number by their gcd, can form the sides of a triangle.  \n\nA triangle can be formed if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.\n\nGiven a set of numbers from 1 to *n*, find how many numbers in the set are lonely (i.e., have no friends in the set). \n\n\nInput:\n\n* The first line contains *t* (1 ≤ *t* ≤ 10⁶) - the number of test cases.\n* Each of the next *t* lines contains an integer *n<sub>i</sub>* (1 ≤ *n<sub>i</sub>* ≤ 10⁶) - the upper limit of the number set for the *i*-th test case.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case, print the number of lonely numbers in the set from 1 to *n<sub>i</sub>*."}, {"prompt_md5": "60e7e81e", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers from 1 to n.
