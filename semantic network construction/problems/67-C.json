Sequence of Ballstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutYou are given a sequence of ballsAby your teacher, each labeled with a lowercase Latin letter 'a'-'z'. You don't like the given sequence. You want to change it into a new sequence,Bthat suits you better. So, you allow yourself four operations:You can insert any ball with any label into the sequence at any position.You can delete (remove) any ball from any position.You can replace any ball with any other ball.You can exchange (swap) two adjacent balls.Your teacher now places time constraints on each operation, meaning that an operation can only be performed in certain time. So, the first operation takes timeti, the second one takestd, the third one takestrand the fourth one takeste. Also, it is given that2·te≥ti+td.Find the minimal time to convert the sequenceAto the sequenceB.InputThe first line contains four space-separated integersti,td,tr,te(0 <ti,td,tr,te≤ 100). The following two lines contain sequencesAandBon separate lines. The length of each line is between 1 and 4000 characters inclusive.OutputPrint a single integer representing minimum time to convertAintoB.ExamplesInput1 1 1 1youshouldnotthoushaltnotOutput5Input2 4 10 3abbaOutput3Input1 10 20 30azaOutput1NoteIn the second sample, you could delete the ball labeled 'a' from the first position and then insert another 'a' at the new second position with total time 6.
