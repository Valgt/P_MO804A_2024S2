Bmail Computer Networktime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOnce upon a time there was only one router in the well-known company Bmail. Years went by and over time new routers were purchased. Every time they bought a new router, they connected it to one of the routers bought before it. You are given the values $$$p_i$$$ — the index of the router to which the $$$i$$$-th router was connected after being purchased ($$$p_i < i$$$).There are $$$n$$$ routers in Boogle in total now. Print the sequence of routers on the path from the first to the $$$n$$$-th router.InputThe first line contains integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 200000$$$) — the number of the routers. The following line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\\\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i < i$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is equal to index of the router to which the $$$i$$$-th was connected after purchase.OutputPrint the path from the $$$1$$$-st to the $$$n$$$-th router. It starts with $$$1$$$ and ends with $$$n$$$. All the elements in the path should be distinct.ExamplesInput81 1 2 2 3 2 5Output1 2 5 8Input61 2 3 4 5Output1 2 3 4 5 6Input71 1 2 3 4 3Output1 3 7", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "608ded59", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of integers $p_2, p_3, ..., p_n$ where $p_i$ represents the index of the router the $i$-th router is connected to.  \n\nGiven $n$ (the total number of routers), find the path of routers from router 1 to router $n$. \n\n**Input:**\n\n* The first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 200000$).\n* The second line contains $n-1$ integers $p_2, p_3, ..., p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i < i$).\n\n**Output:**\n\nPrint the path of routers from router 1 to router $n$."}, {"prompt_md5": "3b63fe21", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers representing how each router is connected to a previous router.
