Balanced Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a positive integer $$$n$$$, it is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is even (i.e. divisible by $$$2$$$).You want to construct the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that:The first $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ elements of $$$a$$$ are even (divisible by $$$2$$$);the second $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ elements of $$$a$$$ are odd (not divisible by $$$2$$$);all elements of $$$a$$$ are distinct and positive;the sum of the first half equals to the sum of the second half ($$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{\\\\frac{n}{2}} a_i = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=\\\\frac{n}{2} + 1}^{n} a_i$$$).If there are multiple answers, you can print any. It isnot guaranteedthat the answer exists.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. It is guaranteed that that $$$n$$$ is even (i.e. divisible by $$$2$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\\\sum n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — \"NO\" (without quotes), if there is no suitable answer for the given test case or \"YES\" in the first line andanysuitable array $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) satisfying conditions from the problem statement on the second line.ExampleInput5 2 4 6 8 10OutputNO YES 2 4 1 5 NO YES 2 4 6 8 1 3 5 11 NO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "cdf6abf4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an even integer $n$.
