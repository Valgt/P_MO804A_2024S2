Bear and Blockstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLimak is a little bear who loves to play. Today he is playing by destroying block towers. He builtntowers in a row. Thei-th tower is made ofhiidentical blocks. For clarification see picture for the first sample.Limak will repeat the following operation till everything is destroyed.Block is called internal if it has all four neighbors, i.e. it has each side (top, left, down and right) adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation Limak destroys all boundary blocks. His paws are very fast and he destroys all those blocks at the same time.Limak is ready to start. You task is to count how many operations will it take him to destroy all towers.InputThe first line contains single integern(1 ≤n≤ 105).The second line containsnspace-separated integersh1,h2, ...,hn(1 ≤hi≤ 109)— sizes of towers.OutputPrint the number of operations needed to destroy all towers.ExamplesInput62 1 4 6 2 2Output3Input73 3 3 1 3 3 3Output2NoteThe picture below shows all three operations for the first sample test. Each time boundary blocks are marked with red color.After first operation there are four blocks left and only one remains after second operation. This last block is destroyed in third operation.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f28c5028", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ towers, where the $i$-th tower has $h_i$ blocks.  \n\nIn one operation, you can destroy all the blocks on the edges of the towers.  \n\nFind the minimum number of operations needed to destroy all the blocks."}, {"prompt_md5": "800a9680", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a row of towers of different heights.
