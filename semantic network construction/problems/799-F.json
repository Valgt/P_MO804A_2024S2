Each garden is a row ofmcells, thei-th garden has one fountain in each of the cells betweenliandriinclusive, and there are no more fountains in that garden. The issue is that some of the gardens contain even number of fountains, it is wrong to show them to Arkady.Ostin wants to choose two integersa≤band show only part of each of the gardens that starts at cellaand ends at cellb. Of course, only such segments suit Ostin that each garden has either zero or odd number of fountains on this segment. Also, it is necessary that at least one garden has at least one fountain on the segment fromatob.Help Ostin to find the total length of all such segments, i.e. sum up the value(b-a+ 1)for each suitable pair(a,b).InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 2·105) — the number of gardens and the length of each garden.nlines follow.
