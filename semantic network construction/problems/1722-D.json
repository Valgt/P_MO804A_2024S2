Linetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ people in a horizontal line, each looking either to the left or the right. Each person counts the number of people in the direction they are looking. Thevalueof the line is the sum of each person's count.For example, in the arrangementLRRLL, whereLstands for a person looking left andRstands for a person looking right, the counts for each person are $$$[0, 3, 2, 3, 4]$$$, and the value is $$$0+3+2+3+4=12$$$.You are given the initial arrangement of people in the line. For each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, determine the maximum value of the line if you can change the direction ofat most$$$k$$$ people.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of the line.The following line contains a string consisting of $$$n$$$ characters, each of which is eitherLorR, representing a person facing left or right, respectively — the description of the line.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$.Please note that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (likelong longfor C++).OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ space-separated non-negative integers — the maximum value of the line if you can change the direction ofat most$$$k$$$ people for each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, inclusive.ExampleInput63LLR5LRRLL1L12LRRRLLLRLLRL10LLLLLRRRRR9LRLRLRLRLOutput3 5 5  16 16 16 16 16  0  86 95 98 101 102 102 102 102 102 102 102 102  29 38 45 52 57 62 65 68 69 70  44 50 54 56 56 56 56 56 56NoteIn the first test case:$$$k=1$$$: change the direction of $$$1$$$ person to make the lineRLR.
