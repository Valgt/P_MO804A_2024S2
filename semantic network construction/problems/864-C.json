Bustime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA bus moves along the coordinate lineOxfrom the pointx= 0to the pointx=a. After starting from the pointx= 0, it reaches the pointx=a, immediately turns back and then moves to the pointx= 0. After returning to the pointx= 0it immediately goes back to the pointx=aand so on. Thus, the bus moves fromx= 0tox=aand back. Moving from the pointx= 0tox=aor from the pointx=atox= 0is called abus journey. In total, the bus must makekjourneys.The petrol tank of the bus can holdbliters of gasoline. To pass a single unit of distance the bus needs to spend exactly one liter of gasoline. The bus starts its first journey with a full petrol tank.There is a gas station in pointx=f. This point is between pointsx= 0andx=a. There are no other gas stations on the bus route. While passing by a gas station in either direction the bus can stop and completely refuel its tank. Thus, after stopping to refuel the tank will containbliters of gasoline.What is the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel at the pointx=fto makekjourneys? The first journey starts in the pointx= 0.InputThe first line contains four integersa,b,f,k(0 <f<a≤ 106,1 ≤b≤ 109,1 ≤k≤ 104) — the endpoint of the first bus journey, the capacity of the fuel tank of the bus, the point where the gas station is located, and the required number of journeys.OutputPrint the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel to makekjourneys. If it is impossible for the bus to makekjourneys, print-1.ExamplesInput6 9 2 4Output4Input6 10 2 4Output2Input6 5 4 3Output-1NoteIn the first example the bus needs to refuel during each journey.In the second example the bus can pass10units of distance without refueling. So the bus makes the whole first journey, passes4units of the distance of the second journey and arrives at the point with the gas station. Then it can refuel its tank, finish the second journey and pass2units of distance from the third journey. In this case, it will again arrive at the point with the gas station. Further, he can refill the tank up to10liters to finish the third journey and ride all the way of the fourth journey. At the end of the journey the tank will be empty.In the third example the bus can not make all3journeys because if it refuels during the second journey, the tanks will contain only5liters of gasoline, but the bus needs to pass8units of distance until next refueling.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "435d0496", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "A bus travels back and forth along a straight line from point 0 to point $a$.
