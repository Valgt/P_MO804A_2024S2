For each pair of neighboring numbers ($$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_2$$$, $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$, ..., $$$a_{n - 1}$$$ and $$$a_n$$$, and $$$a_n$$$ and $$$a_1$$$), you wrote down: are the numbers in the pair equal or not.Unfortunately, you've lost a piece of paper with the array $$$a$$$. Moreover, you are afraid that even information about equality of neighboring elements may be inconsistent. So, you are wondering: is there any array $$$a$$$ which is consistent with information you have about equality or non-equality of corresponding pairs?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Next $$$t$$$ cases follow.The first and only line of each test case contains a non-empty string $$$s$$$ consisting of charactersEand/orN. The length of $$$s$$$ is equal to the size of array $$$n$$$ and $$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$$$. For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$:if $$$s_i =$$$Ethen $$$a_i$$$ is equal to $$$a_{i + 1}$$$ ($$$a_n = a_1$$$ for $$$i = n$$$);if $$$s_i =$$$Nthen $$$a_i$$$ is not equal to $$$a_{i + 1}$$$ ($$$a_n \\\\neq a_1$$$ for $$$i = n$$$).OutputFor each test case, printYESif it's possible to choose array $$$a$$$ that are consistent with information from $$$s$$$ you know. Otherwise, printNO.It can be proved, that if there exists some array $$$a$$$, then there exists an array $$$a$$$ of positive integers with values less or equal to $$$10^9$$$.ExampleInput4 EEE EN ENNEENE NENNOutputYES NO YES YESNoteIn the first test case, you can choose, for example, $$$a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 5$$$.In the second test case, there is no array $$$a$$$, since, according to $$$s_1$$$, $$$a_1$$$ is equal to $$$a_2$$$, but, according to $$$s_2$$$, $$$a_2$$$ is not equal to $$$a_1$$$.In the third test case, you can, for example, choose array $$$a = [20, 20, 4, 50, 50, 50, 20]$$$.In the fourth test case, you can, for example, choose $$$a = [1, 3, 3, 7]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "30040a9a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string  $s$ of length $n$ where each character is either 'E' or 'N'.  \n\n* 'E' means that the corresponding pair of numbers in a circular array are equal.\n* 'N' means that the corresponding pair of numbers in a circular array are not equal.\n\nDetermine if there exists a circular array of positive integers  $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ that satisfies the given information in the string $s$.\n\n**Input:**\n\n* The first line contains an integer $t$ (the number of test cases).\n* Each test case consists of a string $s$ of length $n$ (2 ≤ $n$ ≤ 50).\n\n**Output:**\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if a valid array exists, otherwise print \"NO\"."}, {"prompt_md5": "363dd102", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a string of 'E's and 'N's.
