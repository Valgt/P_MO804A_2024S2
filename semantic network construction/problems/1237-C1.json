Balanced Removals (Easier)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an easier version of the problem. In this version, $$$n \\\\le 2000$$$.There are $$$n$$$ distinct points in three-dimensional space numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th point has coordinates $$$(x_i, y_i, z_i)$$$. The number of points $$$n$$$ is even.You'd like to remove all $$$n$$$ points using a sequence of $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ snaps. In one snap, you can remove any two points $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ that have not been removed yet and form aperfectly balancedpair. A pair of points $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ is perfectly balanced if no other point $$$c$$$ (that has not been removed yet) lies within the axis-aligned minimum bounding box of points $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.Formally, point $$$c$$$ lies within the axis-aligned minimum bounding box of points $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ if and only if $$$\\\\min(x_a, x_b) \\\\le x_c \\\\le \\\\max(x_a, x_b)$$$, $$$\\\\min(y_a, y_b) \\\\le y_c \\\\le \\\\max(y_a, y_b)$$$, and $$$\\\\min(z_a, z_b) \\\\le z_c \\\\le \\\\max(z_a, z_b)$$$. Note that the bounding box might be degenerate.Find a way to remove all points in $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ snaps.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2000$$$; $$$n$$$ is even), denoting the number of points.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$, $$$z_i$$$ ($$$-10^8 \\\\le x_i, y_i, z_i \\\\le 10^8$$$), denoting the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point.No two points coincide.OutputOutput $$$\\\\frac{n}{2}$$$ pairs of integers $$$a_i, b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i, b_i \\\\le n$$$), denoting the indices of points removed on snap $$$i$$$. Every integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive, must appear in your output exactly once.We can show that it is always possible to remove all points. If there are many solutions, output any of them.ExamplesInput6 3 1 0 0 3 0 2 2 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 0 1 0Output3 6 5 1 2 4Input8 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 3Output4 5 1 6 2 7 3 8NoteIn the first example, here is what points and their corresponding bounding boxes look like (drawn in two dimensions for simplicity, as all points lie on $$$z = 0$$$ plane).
