Anton and currency you all knowtime limit per test0.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutBerland, 2016. The exchange rate ofcurrency you all knowagainst the burle has increased so much that to simplify the calculations, its fractional part was neglected and the exchange rate is now assumed to be an integer.Reliable sources have informed the financier Anton of some information about the exchange rate ofcurrency you all knowagainst the burle for tomorrow. Now Anton knows that tomorrow the exchange rate will be an even number, which can be obtained from the present rate by swapping exactly two distinct digits in it. Of all the possible values that meet these conditions, the exchange rate for tomorrow will be the maximum possible. It is guaranteed that today the exchange rate is anoddpositive integern. Help Anton to determine the exchange rate ofcurrency you all knowfor tomorrow!InputThe first line contains an odd positive integern— the exchange rate ofcurrency you all knowfor today. The length of numbern's representation is within range from2to105, inclusive. The representation ofndoesn't contain any leading zeroes.OutputIf the information about tomorrow's exchange rate is inconsistent, that is, there is no integer that meets the condition, print- 1.Otherwise, print the exchange rate ofcurrency you all knowagainst the burle for tomorrow. This should be the maximum possible number of those that are even and that are obtained from today's exchange rate by swapping exactly two digits. Exchange rate representation should not contain leading zeroes.ExamplesInput527Output572Input4573Output3574Input1357997531Output-1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8ec766d6", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an odd positive integer $n$ representing today's exchange rate.
