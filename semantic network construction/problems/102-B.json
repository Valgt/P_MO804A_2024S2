Sum of Digitstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test265 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutHaving watched the last Harry Potter film, little Gerald also decided to practice magic. He found in his father's magical book a spell that turns any number in the sum of its digits. At the moment Gerald learned that, he came across a numbern. How many times can Gerald put a spell on it until the number becomes one-digit?InputThe first line contains the only integern(0 ≤n≤ 10100000). It is guaranteed thatndoesn't contain any leading zeroes.OutputPrint the number of times a number can be replaced by the sum of its digits until it only contains one digit.ExamplesInput0Output0Input10Output1Input991Output3NoteIn the first sample the number already is one-digit — Herald can't cast a spell.The second test contains number10. After one casting of a spell it becomes1, and here the process is completed. Thus, Gerald can only cast the spell once.The third test contains number991. As one casts a spell the following transformations take place:991 → 19 → 10 → 1. After three transformations the number becomes one-digit.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0ee10526", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a number.
