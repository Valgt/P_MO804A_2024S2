Check Transcriptiontime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOne of Arkady's friends works at a huge radio telescope. A few decades ago the telescope has sent a signal $$$s$$$ towards a faraway galaxy. Recently they've received a response $$$t$$$ which they believe to be a response from aliens! The scientists now want to check if the signal $$$t$$$ is similar to $$$s$$$.The original signal $$$s$$$ was a sequence of zeros and ones (everyone knows that binary code is the universe-wide language). The returned signal $$$t$$$, however, does not look as easy as $$$s$$$, but the scientists don't give up! They represented $$$t$$$ as a sequence of English letters and say that $$$t$$$ is similar to $$$s$$$ if you can replace all zeros in $$$s$$$ with some string $$$r_0$$$ and all ones in $$$s$$$ with some other string $$$r_1$$$ and obtain $$$t$$$. The strings $$$r_0$$$ and $$$r_1$$$ must be different and non-empty.Please help Arkady's friend and find the number of possible replacements for zeros and ones (the number of pairs of strings $$$r_0$$$ and $$$r_1$$$) that transform $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$.InputThe first line contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 10^5$$$) consisting of zeros and ones — the original signal.The second line contains a string $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |t| \\\\le 10^6$$$) consisting of lowercase English letters only — the received signal.It is guaranteed, that the string $$$s$$$ contains at least one '0' and at least one '1'.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of pairs of strings $$$r_0$$$ and $$$r_1$$$ that transform $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$.In case there are no such pairs, print $$$0$$$.ExamplesInput01 aaaaaaOutput4Input001 kokokokotlinOutput2NoteIn the first example, the possible pairs $$$(r_0, r_1)$$$ are as follows:\"a\", \"aaaaa\"\"aa\", \"aaaa\"\"aaaa\", \"aa\"\"aaaaa\", \"a\"The pair \"aaa\", \"aaa\" is not allowed, since $$$r_0$$$ and $$$r_1$$$ must be different.In the second example, the following pairs are possible:\"ko\", \"kokotlin\"\"koko\", \"tlin\"", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ea975a9e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two strings,  $s$ and $t$.
