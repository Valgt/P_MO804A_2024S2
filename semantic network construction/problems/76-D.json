In other words, a binary digit of the result is equal to 1 if and only if bits on the respective positions in the operands are different.For example, ifX= 10910= 11011012,Y= 4110= 1010012, then:XxorY=  6810=  10001002.Write a program, which takes two non-negative integersAandBas an input and finds two non-negative integersXandY, which satisfy the following conditions:A=X+YB=XxorY, wherexoris bitwise exclusive or.Xis the smallest number among all numbers for which the first two conditions are true.InputThe first line contains integer numberAand the second line contains integer numberB(0 ≤A,B≤ 264- 1).OutputThe only output line should contain two integer non-negative numbersXandY.
