Palindrome Pairstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAfter learning a lot about space exploration, a little girl named Ana wants to change the subject.Ana is a girl who loves palindromes (string that can be read the same backwards as forward). She has learned how to check for a given string whether it's a palindrome or not, but soon she grew tired of this problem, so she came up with a more interesting one and she needs your help to solve it:You are given an array of strings which consist of only small letters of the alphabet. Your task is to findhow manypalindrome pairs are there in the array. A palindrome pair is a pair of strings such that the following condition holds:at least onepermutation of the concatenation of the two strings is a palindrome. In other words, if you have two strings, let's say \"aab\" and \"abcac\", and you concatenate them into \"aababcac\", we have to check if there exists a permutation of this new string such that it is a palindrome (in this case there exists the permutation \"aabccbaa\").Two pairs are considered different if the strings are located ondifferent indices. The pair of strings with indices $$$(i,j)$$$ is consideredthe sameas the pair $$$(j,i)$$$.InputThe first line contains a positive integer $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le N \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$), representing the length of the input array.Eacg of the next $$$N$$$ lines contains a string (consisting of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z') — an element of the input array.The total number of characters in the input array will be less than $$$1\\\\,000\\\\,000$$$.OutputOutput one number, representinghow many palindrome pairsthere are in the array.ExamplesInput3aabbcdOutput1Input6aababcacdffeedaaaadeOutput6NoteThe first example:aa$$$+$$$bb$$$\\\\to$$$abba.The second example:aab$$$+$$$abcac$$$=$$$aababcac$$$\\\\to$$$aabccbaaaab$$$+$$$aa$$$=$$$aabaaabcac$$$+$$$aa$$$=$$$abcacaa$$$\\\\to$$$aacbcaadffe$$$+$$$ed$$$=$$$dffeed$$$\\\\to$$$fdeedfdffe$$$+$$$aade$$$=$$$dffeaade$$$\\\\to$$$adfaafdeed$$$+$$$aade$$$=$$$edaade$$$\\\\to$$$aeddea", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5e97b596", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of strings consisting of lowercase letters.
