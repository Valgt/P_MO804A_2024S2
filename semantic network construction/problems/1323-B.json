Count Subrectanglestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ both consisting of only integers $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. Consider a matrix $$$c$$$ of size $$$n \\\\times m$$$ formed by following rule: $$$c_{i, j} = a_i \\\\cdot b_j$$$ (i.e. $$$a_i$$$ multiplied by $$$b_j$$$). It's easy to see that $$$c$$$ consists of only zeroes and ones too.How manysubrectanglesof size (area) $$$k$$$ consisting only of ones are there in $$$c$$$?Asubrectangleis an intersection of a consecutive (subsequent) segment of rows and a consecutive (subsequent) segment of columns. I.e. consider four integers $$$x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_1 \\\\le x_2 \\\\le n$$$, $$$1 \\\\le y_1 \\\\le y_2 \\\\le m$$$) a subrectangle $$$c[x_1 \\\\dots x_2][y_1 \\\\dots y_2]$$$ is an intersection of the rows $$$x_1, x_1+1, x_1+2, \\\\dots, x_2$$$ and the columns $$$y_1, y_1+1, y_1+2, \\\\dots, y_2$$$.The size (area) of a subrectangle is the total number of cells in it.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, m \\\\leq 40\\\\,000, 1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n \\\\cdot m$$$), length of array $$$a$$$, length of array $$$b$$$ and required size of subrectangles.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 1$$$), elements of $$$a$$$.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq b_i \\\\leq 1$$$), elements of $$$b$$$.OutputOutput single integer — the number of subrectangles of $$$c$$$ with size (area) $$$k$$$ consisting only of ones.ExamplesInput3 3 2 1 0 1 1 1 1Output4Input3 5 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1Output14NoteIn first example matrix $$$c$$$ is:There are $$$4$$$ subrectangles of size $$$2$$$ consisting of only ones in it:In second example matrix $$$c$$$ is:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b416fc56", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two arrays,  'a' of length 'n' and 'b' of length 'm', both containing only 0s and 1s. \n\nCreate a matrix 'c' of size 'n x m' where each cell 'c[i, j]' is the product of 'a[i]' and 'b[j]'.\n\nCount the number of subrectangles in matrix 'c' that have an area of 'k' and are filled with only 1s.\n\nA subrectangle is a rectangular section of the matrix formed by selecting a range of consecutive rows and a range of consecutive columns. \n\n\nThe input will include:\n\n* 'n', 'm', and 'k' (the dimensions of the matrix and the desired subrectangle area)\n* The elements of array 'a'\n* The elements of array 'b'\n\n\n\nOutput the total number of valid subrectangles."}, {"prompt_md5": "084ffdee", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given two arrays of 0s and 1s.
