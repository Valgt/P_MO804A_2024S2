Where Are My Flakes?time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutOne morning the Cereal Guy found out that all his cereal flakes were gone. He found a note instead of them. It turned out that his smart roommate hid the flakes in one ofnboxes. The boxes stand in one row, they are numbered from1tonfrom the left to the right. The roommate left hints like \"Hidden to the left of thei-th box\" (\"To the left ofi\"), \"Hidden to the right of thei-th box\" (\"To the right ofi\"). Such hints mean that there are no flakes in thei-th box as well. The Cereal Guy wants to know the minimal number of boxes he necessarily needs to check to find the flakes considering all the hints. Or he wants to find out that the hints are contradictory and the roommate lied to him, that is, no box has the flakes.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n≤ 1000, 0 ≤m≤ 1000) which represent the number of boxes and the number of hints correspondingly. Nextmlines contain hints like \"To the left ofi\" and \"To the right ofi\", whereiis integer (1 ≤i≤n). The hints may coincide.OutputThe answer should contain exactly one integer — the number of boxes that should necessarily be checked or \"-1\" if the hints are contradictory.ExamplesInput2 1To the left of 2Output1Input3 2To the right of 1To the right of 2Output1Input3 1To the left of 3Output2Input3 2To the left of 2To the right of 1Output-1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "67946f3f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ boxes numbered from 1 to $n$.
