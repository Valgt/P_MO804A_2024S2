Ian and Array Sortingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTo thank Ian, Mary gifted an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ to Ian. To make himself look smart, he wants to make the array in non-decreasing order by doing the following finitely many times: he chooses two adjacent elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$ ($$$1\\\\le i\\\\le n-1$$$), and increases both of them by $$$1$$$ or decreases both of them by $$$1$$$. Note that, the elements of the arraycanbecome negative.As a smart person, you notice that, there are some arrays such that Ian cannot make it become non-decreasing order! Therefore, you decide to write a program to determine if it is possible to make the array in non-decreasing order.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case consists of a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\\\le n\\\\le 3\\\\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\le a_i\\\\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3\\\\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" if there exists a sequence of operations which make the array non-decreasing, else output \"NO\".You may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as positive answer).ExampleInput531 3 222 141 3 5 742 1 4 355 4 3 2 1OutputYES NO YES NO YESNoteFor the first test case, we can increase $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$ both by $$$1$$$. The array is now $$$[1, 4, 3]$$$.Then we can decrease $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_2$$$ both by $$$1$$$. The array is now $$$[0, 3, 3]$$$, which is sorted in non-decreasing order. So the answer is \"YES\".For the second test case, no matter how Ian perform the operations, $$$a_1$$$ will always be larger than $$$a_2$$$. So the answer is \"NO\" and Ian cannot pretend to be smart.For the third test case, the array is already in non-decreasing order, so Ian does not need to do anything.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e4dcefa1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
