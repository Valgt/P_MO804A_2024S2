INI-filetime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe INI file format is a de facto standard for configuration files. INI files are simple text files with a basic structure. They are commonly associated with Microsoft Windows, but are also used on other platforms.Each line in INI-file stands for key-value mapping or defines new section. A key-value line has a format \"key=value\",wherekey— is the name of some property, andvalue— it's value. It is possible that it will be spaces from the both sides ofkeyand/orvalue, the spaces should be ignored.A section line has a format \"[section]\". It means that all key-value lines after it define properties of the specified section. Of cause, the following section line changes the current section. A section line may have spaces around any of brackets.Also you should ignore comment lines — the first non-space character of comment line is \";\".You task is to write the program which will format given INI-file in a special way:first, print key-value lines which do not belong to any section;print all the sections in the lexicographical (alphabetical) order of their names;inside each of two previous items, order key-value lines lexicographically by \"key\";if there are more than one key-value lines with the same key inside a single section (or outside any sections), leave only one line (which appears later in the input data);remove all redundant spaces and lines.InputThe first line contains single integern(1 ≤n≤ 510) — the number of lines in given INI-file.The rest of the input contains a valid INI-file innlines. Values ofsection,keyandvaluecontain only Latin letters, digits, \".\" and/or \"-\".Each line has length not exceeding 255 characters and not less than 1 character. The total length of all the lines does’t exceed 10000.OutputPrint formatted INI-file.ExamplesInput11a= 1b=aa = 2; comment[z]1=2[y]2=3[z]2=1[w]Outputa=2b=a[w][y]2=3[z]1=22=1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5ded4736", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a text file formatted like an INI file.
