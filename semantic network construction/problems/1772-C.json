Different Differencestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAn array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$k$$$ integers isstrictly increasingif $$$a_1 < a_2 < \\\\dots < a_k$$$. For example, the arrays $$$[1, 3, 5]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$, $$$[3, 5, 6]$$$ are strictly increasing; the arrays $$$[2, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 7, 5]$$$, $$$[7, 4, 3]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 2, 3]$$$ are not.For a strictly increasing array $$$a$$$ of $$$k$$$ elements, let's denote thecharacteristicas the number of different elements in the array $$$[a_2 - a_1, a_3 - a_2, \\\\dots, a_k - a_{k-1}]$$$. For example, the characteristic of the array $$$[1, 3, 4, 7, 8]$$$ is $$$3$$$ since the array $$$[2, 1, 3, 1]$$$ contains $$$3$$$ different elements: $$$2$$$, $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$.You are given two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$k \\\\le n$$$). Construct an increasing array of $$$k$$$ integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ withmaximum possiblecharacteristic.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 819$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 40$$$).OutputFor each test case, print $$$k$$$ integers — the elements of the strictly increasing array $$$a$$$ with the maximum possible characteristic.
