Three-level Lasertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAn atom of element X can exist inndistinct states with energiesE1<E2< ... <En. Arkady wants to build a laser on this element, using a three-level scheme. Here is a simplified description of the scheme.Three distinct statesi,jandkare selected, wherei<j<k. After that the following process happens:initially the atom is in the statei,we spendEk-Eienergy to put the atom in the statek,the atom emits a photon with useful energyEk-Ejand changes its state to the statej,the atom spontaneously changes its state to the statei, losing energyEj-Ei,the process repeats from step 1.Let's define the energy conversion efficiency as, i. e. the ration between the useful energy of the photon and spent energy.Due to some limitations, Arkady can only choose such three states thatEk-Ei≤U.Help Arkady to find such the maximum possible energy conversion efficiency within the above constraints.InputThe first line contains two integersnandU(3 ≤n≤ 105,1 ≤U≤ 109) — the number of states and the maximum possible difference betweenEkandEi.The second line contains a sequence of integersE1,E2, ...,En(1 ≤E1<E2... <En≤ 109). It is guaranteed that allEiare given in increasing order.OutputIf it is not possible to choose three states that satisfy all constraints, print-1.Otherwise, print one real numberη— the maximum possible energy conversion efficiency.
