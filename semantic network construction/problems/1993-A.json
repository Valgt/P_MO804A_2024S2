For each option, there are exactly $$$n$$$ correct answers corresponding to that option — meaning there are $$$n$$$ questions with the answer 'A', $$$n$$$ questions with the answer 'B', $$$n$$$ questions with the answer 'C', and $$$n$$$ questions with the answer 'D'.For each question, Tim wrote his answer on the answer sheet. If he could not figure out the answer, he would leave a question mark '?' for that question.You are given his answer sheet of $$$4n$$$ characters. What is the maximum number of correct answers Tim can get?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$).The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of $$$4n$$$ characters ($$$s_i \\\\in \\\\{\\\\texttt{A}, \\\\texttt{B}, \\\\texttt{C}, \\\\texttt{D}, \\\\texttt{?}\\\\}$$$) — Tim's answers for the questions.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the maximum score that Tim can achieve.ExampleInput61ABCD2AAAAAAAA2AAAABBBB2????????3ABCABCABCABC5ACADC??ACAC?DCAABC?COutput4 2 4 0 9 13NoteIn the first test case, there is exactly one question with each answer 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'; so it's possible that Tim gets all his answers correct.In the second test case, there are only two correct answers 'A' which makes him get exactly $$$2$$$ points in any case.In the third test case, Tim can get at most $$$2$$$ correct answers with option 'A' and $$$2$$$ correct answers with option 'B'. For example, he would get $$$4$$$ points if the answers were 'AACCBBDD'.In the fourth test case, he refuses to answer any question at all, which makes him get $$$0$$$ points.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e191c2f3", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a string of characters representing answers to a test.
