Subset Tricktime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVanya invented an interesting trick with a set of integers.Let an illusionist have a set of positive integers $$$S$$$. He names a positive integer $$$x$$$. Then an audience volunteer must choose some subset (possibly, empty) of $$$S$$$ without disclosing it to the illusionist. The volunteer tells the illusionist the size of the chosen subset. And here comes the trick: the illusionist guesses whether the sum of the subset elements does not exceed $$$x$$$. The sum of elements of an empty subset is considered to be $$$0$$$.Vanya wants to prepare the trick for a public performance. He prepared some set ofdistinctpositive integers $$$S$$$. Vasya wants the trick to be successful. He calls a positive number $$$x$$$unsuitable, if he can't be sure that the trick would be successful for every subset a viewer can choose.Vanya wants to count the number of unsuitable integers for the chosen set $$$S$$$.Vanya plans to try different sets $$$S$$$. He wants you to write a program that finds the number of unsuitable integers for the initial set $$$S$$$, and after each change to the set $$$S$$$. Vanya will make $$$q$$$ changes to the set, and each change is one of the following two types:add a new integer $$$a$$$ to the set $$$S$$$, orremove some integer $$$a$$$ from the set $$$S$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, q \\\\leq 200\\\\,000$$$) — the size of the initial set $$$S$$$ and the number of changes.The next line contains $$$n$$$distinctintegers $$$s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq s_i \\\\leq 10^{13}$$$) — the initial elements of $$$S$$$.Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$t_i$$$, $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t_i \\\\leq 2$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^{13}$$$), describing a change:If $$$t_i = 1$$$, then an integer $$$a_i$$$ is added to the set $$$S$$$. It is guaranteed that this integer is not present in $$$S$$$ before this operation.If $$$t_i = 2$$$, then an integer $$$a_i$$$ is removed from the set $$$S$$$. In is guaranteed that this integer is present in $$$S$$$ before this operation.OutputPrint $$$q + 1$$$ lines.In the first line print the number of unsuitable integers for the initial set $$$S$$$. In the next $$$q$$$ lines print the number of unsuitable integers for $$$S$$$ after each change.ExampleInput3 11 1 2 3 2 1 1 5 1 6 1 7 2 6 2 2 2 3 1 10 2 5 2 7 2 10Output4 1 6 12 19 13 8 2 10 3 0 0NoteIn the first example the initial set is $$$S = \\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}$$$. For this set the trick can be unsuccessful for $$$x \\\\in \\\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\\\}$$$. For example, if $$$x = 4$$$, the volunteer can choose the subset $$$\\\\{1, 2\\\\}$$$ with sum $$$3 \\\\leq x$$$, and can choose the subset $$$\\\\{2, 3\\\\}$$$ with sum $$$5 > x$$$. However, in both cases the illusionist only know the same size of the subset ($$$2$$$), so he can't be sure answering making a guess. Since there is only one subset of size $$$3$$$, and the sum of each subset of smaller size does not exceed $$$5$$$, all $$$x \\\\ge 5$$$ are suitable.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "42c5cad3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of distinct positive integers $S$.
