Escalator Conversationstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOne day, Vlad became curious about who he can have a conversation with on the escalator in the subway. There are a total of $$$n$$$ passengers. The escalator has a total of $$$m$$$ steps, all steps indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ and $$$i$$$-th step has height $$$i \\\\cdot k$$$.Vlad's height is $$$H$$$ centimeters. Two people with heights $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ can have a conversation on the escalator if they are standing ondifferentsteps and the height difference between them is equal to the height difference between the steps.For example, if two people have heights $$$170$$$ and $$$180$$$ centimeters, and $$$m = 10, k = 5$$$, then they can stand on steps numbered $$$7$$$ and $$$5$$$, where the height difference between the steps is equal to the height difference between the two people: $$$k \\\\cdot 2 = 5 \\\\cdot 2 = 10 = 180 - 170$$$. There are other possible ways.Given an array $$$h$$$ of size $$$n$$$, where $$$h_i$$$ represents the height of the $$$i$$$-th person. Vlad is interested in how many people he can have a conversation with on the escalatorindividually.For example, if $$$n = 5, m = 3, k = 3, H = 11$$$, and $$$h = [5, 4, 14, 18, 2]$$$, Vlad can have a conversation with the person with height $$$5$$$ (Vlad will stand on step $$$1$$$, and the other person will stand on step $$$3$$$) and with the person with height $$$14$$$ (for example, Vlad can stand on step $$$3$$$, and the other person will stand on step $$$2$$$). Vlad cannot have a conversation with the person with height $$$2$$$ because even if they stand on the extreme steps of the escalator, the height difference between them will be $$$6$$$, while their height difference is $$$9$$$. Vlad cannot have a conversation with the rest of the people on the escalator, so the answer for this example is $$$2$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains integers: $$$n, m, k, H$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n,m \\\\le 50$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k,H \\\\le 10^6$$$). Here, $$$n$$$ is the number of people, $$$m$$$ is the number of steps, $$$k$$$ is the height difference between neighboring steps, and $$$H$$$ is Vlad's height.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers: $$$h_1, h_2, \\\\ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le h_i \\\\le 10^6$$$). Here, $$$h_i$$$ represents the height of the $$$i$$$-th person.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of people Vlad can have a conversation with on the escalatorindividually.ExampleInput75 3 3 115 4 14 18 22 9 5 611 910 50 3 1143 44 74 98 62 60 99 4 11 734 8 8 4968 58 82 737 1 4 6618 66 39 83 48 99 799 1 1 1326 23 84 6 60 87 40 41 256 13 3 2830 70 85 13 1 55Output2 1 4 1 0 0 3NoteThe first example is explained in the problem statement.In the second example, Vlad can have a conversation with the person with height $$$11$$$.In the third example, Vlad can have a conversation with people with heights: $$$44, 74, 98, 62$$$. Therefore, the answer is $$$4$$$.In the fourth example, Vlad can have a conversation with the person with height $$$73$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "668ceecc", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an escalator with $m$ steps.
