Three Brotherstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThree brothers agreed to meet. Let's number the brothers as follows: the oldest brother is number1, the middle brother is number2, and the youngest brother is number3.When it was time for the meeting, one of the brothers was late. Given the numbers of the two brothers who arrived on time, you need to determine the number of the brother who was late.InputThe first line of input contains two different integersaandb(1 ≤a,b≤ 3,a≠b) — the numbers of the brothers who arrived on time.
