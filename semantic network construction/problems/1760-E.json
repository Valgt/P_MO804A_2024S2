The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The following line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated positive integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$,..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 1$$$) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer  — the maximum number of inversions the array can have after performingat most oneoperation.ExampleInput541 0 1 060 1 0 0 1 020 081 0 1 1 0 0 0 131 1 1Output3 7 1 13 2NoteFor the first test case, the inversions are initially formed by the pairs of indices ($$$1, 2$$$), ($$$1, 4$$$), ($$$3, 4$$$), being a total of $$$3$$$, which already is the maximum possible.For the second test case, the inversions are initially formed by the pairs of indices ($$$2, 3$$$), ($$$2, 4$$$), ($$$2, 6$$$), ($$$5, 6$$$), being a total of four. But, by flipping the first element, the array becomes $$${1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0}$$$, which has the inversions formed by the pairs of indices ($$$1, 3$$$), ($$$1, 4$$$), ($$$1, 6$$$), ($$$2, 3$$$), ($$$2, 4$$$), ($$$2, 6$$$), ($$$5, 6$$$) which total to $$$7$$$ inversions which is the maximum possible.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6a251791", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a binary array of length $n$ containing only 0s and 1s.
