The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of string pairs.Next $$$n$$$ lines contains descriptions of pairs — one per line. The $$$i$$$-th line contains space-separated strings $$$s_i$$$ and $$$t_i$$$ and marker $$$r_i$$$. Strings are non-empty, consist of lowercase Latin letters and each have length at most $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$. The marker $$$r_i$$$ equals to $$$1$$$ if strings have to rhyme, or $$$0$$$ if they must not rhyme.It's guaranteed that for each test case there is at least one pair with $$$r_i$$$ equal to $$$1$$$ and that the total length of all strings over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$4 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, firstly print integer $$$m$$$ — the number of possible non-negative integer values of $$$k$$$ such that pairs that have to rhyme, rhyme and pairs that must not rhyme, don't rhyme. Next, print all these values of $$$k$$$ (without repetitions). You can print them in any order.ExampleInput3 1 kotlin heroes 1 2 join kotlin 1 episode eight 0 4 abc abcdef 0 xyz zzz 1 aaa bba 0 c d 0Output1 0 2 1 2 0NoteIn the first test case, if $$$k$$$ is at least $$$1$$$ thenkotlinandheroesdon't rhyme.In the second test case, for $$$k = 2$$$joinandkotlinrhyme, andepisodeandeightdon't rhyme.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "11d42ead", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ pairs of strings.
