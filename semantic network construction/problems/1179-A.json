Valeriy and Dequetime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecently, on the course of algorithms and data structures, Valeriy learned how to use a deque. He built a deque filled with $$$n$$$ elements. The $$$i$$$-th element is $$$a_i$$$ ($$$i$$$ = $$$1, 2, \\\\ldots, n$$$). He gradually takes the first two leftmost elements from the deque (let's call them $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$, respectively), and then does the following: if $$$A > B$$$, he writes $$$A$$$ to the beginning and writes $$$B$$$ to the end of the deque, otherwise, he writes to the beginning $$$B$$$, and $$$A$$$ writes to the end of the deque. We call this sequence of actions an operation.For example, if deque was $$$[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]$$$, on the operation he will write $$$B=3$$$ to the beginning and $$$A=2$$$ to the end, so he will get $$$[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]$$$.The teacher of the course, seeing Valeriy, who was passionate about his work, approached him and gave him $$$q$$$ queries. Each query consists of the singular number $$$m_j$$$ $$$(j = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, q)$$$. It is required for each query to answer which two elements he will pull out on the $$$m_j$$$-th operation.Note thatthe queries are independentand for each query the numbers $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ should beprinted in the order in which they will be pulled out of the deque.Dequeis a data structure representing a list of elements where insertion of new elements or deletion of existing elements can be made from both sides.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\\\leq q \\\\leq 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the deque and the number of queries. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ $$$(0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9)$$$ — the deque element in $$$i$$$-th position. The next $$$q$$$ lines contain one number each, meaning $$$m_j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq m_j \\\\leq 10^{18}$$$).OutputFor each teacher's query, output two numbers $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ — the numbers that Valeriy pulls out of the deque for the $$$m_j$$$-th operation.ExamplesInput5 3 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 10Output1 2 2 3 5 2Input2 0 0 0OutputNoteConsider all 10 steps for the first test in detail:$$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$$$ — on the first operation, $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, respectively.So, $$$2$$$ we write to the beginning of the deque, and $$$1$$$ — to the end.We get the following status of the deque: $$$[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]$$$.$$$[2, 3, 4, 5, 1] \\\\Rightarrow A = 2, B = 3$$$.$$$[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]$$$$$$[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]$$$$$$[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]$$$$$$[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]$$$$$$[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]$$$$$$[5, 4, 1, 2, 3]$$$$$$[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]$$$$$$[5, 2, 3, 4, 1] \\\\Rightarrow A = 5, B = 2$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6ba8fb2c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ integers.
