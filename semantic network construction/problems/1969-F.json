You are given the sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ denoting the types of cards in the deck from top to bottom. Both $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ are even numbers.You play a game with these cards. First, you draw $$$k$$$ topmost cards from the deck. Then, the following happens each turn of the game:you chooseexactlytwo cards from your hand and play them. If these cards have the same type, you earn a coin;then, if the deck is not empty, you drawexactlytwo top cards from it;then, if both your hand and your deck are empty, the game ends. Otherwise, the new turn begins.You have to calculate the maximum number of coins you can earn during the game.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$, both $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ are even).The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le k$$$).OutputPrint one integer â€” the maximum number of coins you can earn.ExamplesInput4 21 2 1 2Output0Input8 22 1 2 2 1 2 1 2Output1Input4 41 2 1 2Output2Input6 43 2 3 1 2 1Output3Input6 43 2 3 3 2 1Output2Input18 65 6 1 1 6 5 4 1 5 1 1 6 2 6 2 2 6 3Output6Input8 41 2 3 4 4 3 1 2Output2Input8 41 2 3 4 4 3 3 2Output3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "598bbc29", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have a deck of $n$ cards, each with one of $k$ types.
