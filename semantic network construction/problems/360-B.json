Levko and Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLevko has an array that consists of integers:a1,a2, ... ,an. But he doesn’t like this array at all.Levko thinks that the beauty of the arrayadirectly depends on valuec(a), which can be calculated by the formula:The less valuec(a)is, the more beautiful the array is.It’s time to change the world and Levko is going to change his array for the better. To be exact, Levko wants to change the values of at mostkarray elements (it is allowed to replace the values by any integers). Of course, the changes should make the array as beautiful as possible.Help Levko and calculate what minimum numberc(a)he can reach.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤k≤n≤ 2000).
