And for array $$$[1, 4, 7, 7]$$$ the value $$$D=3$$$ is also minimum possible. You can add it to $$$1$$$ and subtract it from $$$7$$$ and obtain the array $$$[4, 4, 4, 4]$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 100$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$.OutputPrint one integer — theminimum non-negative integervalue $$$D$$$ such that if you add this value to some $$$a_i$$$, subtract this value from some $$$a_i$$$ and leave some $$$a_i$$$ without changes, all obtained values become equal.If it is impossible to choose such value $$$D$$$, print-1.ExamplesInput6 1 4 4 7 4 1Output3Input5 2 2 5 2 5Output3Input4 1 3 3 7Output-1Input2 2 8Output3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "874f813e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ integers: $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
