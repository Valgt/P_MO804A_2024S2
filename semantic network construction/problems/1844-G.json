Tree Weightstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree with $$$n$$$ nodes labelled $$$1,2,\\\\dots,n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th edge connects nodes $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ and has an unknown positive integer weight $$$w_i$$$. To help you figure out these weights, you are also given the distance $$$d_i$$$ between the nodes $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ for all $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le n-1$$$ (the sum of the weights of the edges on the simple path between the nodes $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ in the tree).Find the weight of each edge. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. If there are no weights $$$w_i$$$ consistent with the information, print a single integer $$$-1$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$).The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u_i,v_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$u_i \\\\ne v_i$$$).The last line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$d_1,\\\\dots,d_{n-1}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le d_i \\\\le 10^{12}$$$).It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.OutputIf there is no solution, print a single integer $$$-1$$$.
