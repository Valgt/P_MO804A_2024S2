Shoe Shufflingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA class of students got bored wearing the same pair of shoes every day, so they decided to shuffle their shoes among themselves. In this problem, a pair of shoes is inseparable and is considered as a single object.There are $$$n$$$ students in the class, and you are given an array $$$s$$$ innon-decreasingorder, where $$$s_i$$$ is the shoe size of the $$$i$$$-th student. A shuffling of shoes is valid only ifno student gets their own shoesand if every student gets shoes of sizegreater than or equal totheir size.You have to output a permutation $$$p$$$ of $$$\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,n\\\\}$$$ denoting a valid shuffling of shoes, where the $$$i$$$-th student gets the shoes of the $$$p_i$$$-th student ($$$p_i \\\\ne i$$$). And output $$$-1$$$ if a valid shuffling does not exist.A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq10^5$$$) — the number of students.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$s_1, s_2,\\\\ldots,s_n$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq s_i\\\\leq10^9$$$, and for all $$$1\\\\le i<n$$$, $$$s_i\\\\le s_{i+1}$$$) — the shoe sizes of the students.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the answer in a single line using the following format.If a valid shuffling does not exist, print the number $$$-1$$$ as the answer.If a valid shuffling exists, print $$$n$$$ space-separated integers — a permutation $$$p$$$ of $$$1,2,\\\\ldots,n$$$ denoting a valid shuffling of shoes where the $$$i$$$-th student gets the shoes of the $$$p_i$$$-th student. If there are multiple answers, then print any of them.ExampleInput2 5 1 1 1 1 1 6 3 6 8 13 15 21Output5 1 2 3 4  -1NoteIn the first test case, any permutation $$$p$$$ of $$$1,\\\\ldots,n$$$ where $$$p_i\\\\ne i$$$ would represent a valid shuffling since all students have equal shoe sizes, and thus anyone can wear anyone's shoes.In the second test case, it can be shown that no valid shuffling is possible.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7661dea5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array $s$ of $n$ integers representing the shoe sizes of $n$ students, where $s_i \\le s_{i+1}$ for all $i$.  \n\nYou need to find a permutation $p$ of the numbers $1$ to $n$ such that:\n\n* $p_i \\neq i$ for all $i$ (no student gets their own shoes)\n* $s_{p_i} \\ge s_i$ for all $i$ (each student gets shoes of size greater than or equal to their own size).\n\nIf such a permutation exists, output it.
