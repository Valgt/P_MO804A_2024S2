It is said that she can do unimaginable calculation work in an instant.—Perfect Memento in Strict SenseRan Yakumo is a cute girl who loves creating cute Maths problems.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the minimalsquare numberstrictlygreater than $$$x$$$, and $$$g(x)$$$ be the maximal square number less than or equal to $$$x$$$. For example, $$$f(1)=f(2)=g(4)=g(8)=4$$$.A positive integer $$$x$$$ iscuteif $$$x-g(x)<f(x)-x$$$. For example, $$$1,5,11$$$ are cute integers, while $$$3,8,15$$$ are not.Ran gives you an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. She wants you to find the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that $$$a_i + k$$$ is a cute number for any element of $$$a$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^6$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ intergers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_1 \\\\leq a_2 \\\\leq \\\\ldots \\\\leq a_n \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot 10^6$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.OutputPrint a single interger $$$k$$$ — the answer.ExamplesInput4 1 3 8 10Output1Input5 2 3 8 9 11Output8Input8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8Output48NoteTest case 1:$$$3$$$ is not cute integer, so $$$k\\\\ne 0$$$.$$$2,4,9,11$$$ are cute integers, so $$$k=1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b6e0f928", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a$ of length $n$.  \n\nDefine $f(x)$ as the smallest square number strictly greater than $x$ and $g(x)$ as the largest square number less than or equal to $x$.
