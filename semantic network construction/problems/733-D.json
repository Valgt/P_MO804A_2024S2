Kostya the Sculptortime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKostya is a genial sculptor, he has an idea: to carve a marble sculpture in the shape of a sphere. Kostya has a friend Zahar who works at a career. Zahar knows about Kostya's idea and wants to present him a rectangular parallelepiped of marble from which he can carve the sphere.Zahar hasnstones which are rectangular parallelepipeds. The edges sizes of thei-th of them areai,biandci. He can takeno more than two stonesand present them to Kostya.If Zahar takes two stones, he should glue them together on one of the faces in order to get a new piece of rectangular parallelepiped of marble. Thus, it is possible to glue a pair of stones together if and only if two faces on which they are glued together match as rectangles. In such gluing it is allowed to rotate and flip the stones in any way.Help Zahar choose such a present so that Kostya can carve a sphere of the maximum possible volume and present it to Zahar.InputThe first line contains the integern(1 ≤n≤ 105).nlines follow, in thei-th of which there are three integersai,biandci(1 ≤ai,bi,ci≤ 109) — the lengths of edges of thei-th stone. Note, that two stones may have exactly the same sizes, but they still will be considered two different stones.OutputIn the first line printk(1 ≤k≤ 2) the number of stones which Zahar has chosen. In the second line printkdistinct integers from1ton— the numbers of stones which Zahar needs to choose. Consider that stones are numbered from1tonin the order as they are given in the input data.You can print the stones in arbitrary order. If there are several answers print any of them.ExamplesInput65 5 53 2 41 4 12 1 33 2 43 3 4Output11Input710 7 85 10 34 2 65 5 510 2 84 2 17 7 7Output21 5NoteIn the first example we can connect the pairs of stones:2and4, the size of the parallelepiped:3 × 2 × 5, the radius of the inscribed sphere12and5, the size of the parallelepiped:3 × 2 × 8or6 × 2 × 4or3 × 4 × 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere1, or1, or1.5respectively.2and6, the size of the parallelepiped:3 × 5 × 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere1.54and5, the size of the parallelepiped:3 × 2 × 5, the radius of the inscribed sphere15and6, the size of the parallelepiped:3 × 4 × 5, the radius of the inscribed sphere1.5Or take only one stone:1the size of the parallelepiped:5 × 5 × 5, the radius of the inscribed sphere2.52the size of the parallelepiped:3 × 2 × 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere13the size of the parallelepiped:1 × 4 × 1, the radius of the inscribed sphere0.54the size of the parallelepiped:2 × 1 × 3, the radius of the inscribed sphere0.55the size of the parallelepiped:3 × 2 × 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere16the size of the parallelepiped:3 × 3 × 4, the radius of the inscribed sphere1.5It is most profitable to take only the first stone.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7e025ea4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of rectangular blocks, each with dimensions $a_i \\times b_i \\times c_i$.
