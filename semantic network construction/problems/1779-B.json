MKnez's ConstructiveForces Tasktime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMKnez wants to construct an array $$$s_1,s_2, \\\\ldots , s_n$$$ satisfying the following conditions:Each element is an integer number different from $$$0$$$;For each pair of adjacent elements their sum is equal to the sum of the whole array.More formally, $$$s_i \\\\neq 0$$$ must hold for each $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$. Moreover, it must hold that $$$s_1 + s_2 + \\\\cdots + s_n = s_i + s_{i+1}$$$ for each $$$1 \\\\leq i < n$$$.Help MKnez to construct an array with these properties or determine that it does not exist.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the length of the array.OutputFor each test case, print \"YES\" if an array of length $$$n$$$ satisfying the conditions exists. Otherwise, print \"NO\". If the answer is \"YES\", on the next line print a sequence $$$s_1,s_2, \\\\ldots, s_n$$$ satisfying the conditions. Each element should be a non-zero integer in the range $$$[-5000,5000]$$$, i. e. $$$-5000 \\\\leq s_i \\\\leq 5000$$$ and $$$s_i \\\\neq 0$$$ should hold for each $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$.It can be proved that if a solution exists then there also exists one which satisfies the additional constraints on the range.If there are several correct answers, print any of them.ExampleInput2 2 3OutputYES 9 5 NONoteIn the first test case, $$$[9,5]$$$ is a valid answer since $$$9+5$$$ (the sum of the two adjacent elements $$$s_1+s_2$$$) is equal to $$$9+5$$$ (the sum of all elements). Other solutions include $$$[6,-9], [-1,-2], [-5000,5000], \\\\ldots$$$For the second test case, let us show why some arraysdo notsatisfy the constraints:$$$[1,1,1]$$$  — $$$s_1+s_2 = 1+1 = 2$$$ and $$$s_1+s_2+s_3=1+1+1 = 3$$$ differ;$$$[1,-1,1]$$$  — $$$s_1+s_2=1+(-1)=0$$$ and $$$s_1+s_2+s_3=1+(-1)+1 = 1$$$ differ;$$$[0,0,0]$$$  — The array $$$s$$$ cannot contain a $$$0$$$.This isnota proof, but it can be shown that the answer is \"NO\".", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "67988423", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a number n.
