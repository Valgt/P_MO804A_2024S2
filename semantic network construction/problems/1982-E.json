Number of k-good subarraystime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet $$$bit(x)$$$ denote the number of ones in the binary representation of a non-negative integer $$$x$$$.A subarray of an array is called$$$k$$$-goodif it consists only of numbers with no more than $$$k$$$ ones in their binary representation, i.e., a subarray $$$(l, r)$$$ of array $$$a$$$ is good if for any $$$i$$$ such that $$$l \\\\le i \\\\le r$$$ condition $$$bit(a_{i}) \\\\le k$$$ is satisfied.You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of consecutive non-negative integers starting from $$$0$$$, i.e., $$$a_{i} = i$$$ for $$$0 \\\\le i \\\\le n - 1$$$ (in $$$0$$$-based indexing). You need to count the number of$$$k$$$-goodsubarrays in this array.As the answer can be very large, output it modulo $$$10^{9} + 7$$$.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^{4}$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases.The single line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^{18}, 1 \\\\le k \\\\le 60$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of$$$k$$$-goodsubarrays modulo $$$10^{9} + 7$$$.ExampleInput106 116 21 13 131 314 11337 5100000 20795569939321040850 56576460752303423268 59Output7 35 1 6 155 8 7323 49965 741136395 66679884NoteFor the first test case $$$a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$$$, $$$k = 1$$$.To find the answer, let's write all the numbers in binary representation:$$$$$$a = [\\\\color{green}{000}, \\\\color{green}{001}, \\\\color{green}{010}, \\\\color{red}{011}, \\\\color{green}{100}, \\\\color{red}{101}]$$$$$$From this, it can be seen that the numbers $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ have $$$2 \\\\ge (k = 1)$$$ ones in their binary representation, so the answer should include all subarrays that do not contain either $$$3$$$ or $$$5$$$, which are the subarrays (in $$$0$$$-based indexing): ($$$0$$$, $$$0$$$), ($$$0$$$, $$$1$$$), ($$$0$$$, $$$2$$$), ($$$1$$$, $$$1$$$), ($$$1$$$, $$$2$$$), ($$$2$$$, $$$2$$$), ($$$4$$$, $$$4$$$).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "35c8dfb3", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of consecutive non-negative integers starting from 0.
