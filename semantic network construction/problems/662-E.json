To Hack or not to Hacktime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutConsider a regular Codeforces round consisting of three problems that uses dynamic scoring.You are given an almost final scoreboard. For each participant (including yourself), the time of the accepted submission for each of the problems is given. Also, for each solution you already know whether you are able to hack it or not. The only changes in the scoreboard that will happen before the end of the round are your challenges.What is the best place you may take at the end?More formally,npeople are participating (including yourself). For any problem, if it was solved by exactlykpeople at the end of the round, the maximum score for this problem is defined as:Ifn< 2k≤ 2n, then the maximum possible score is500;Ifn< 4k≤ 2n, then the maximum possible score is1000;Ifn< 8k≤ 2n, then the maximum possible score is1500;Ifn< 16k≤ 2n, then the maximum possible score is2000;Ifn< 32k≤ 2n, then the maximum possible score is2500;If32k≤n, then the maximum possible score is3000.Let the maximum possible score for some problem be equal tos. Then a contestant who didn't manage to get it accepted (or his solution was hacked) earns0points for this problem. If he got the the solution acceptedtminutes after the beginning of the round (and his solution wasn't hacked), he earnspoints for this problem.The overall score of a participant is equal to the sum of points he earns for each problem plus100points for each successful hack (only you make hacks).The resulting place you get is equal to one plus the number of participants who's overall score is strictly greater than yours.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 5000) — the number of participants. You are the participant number1.Each of the followingnlines contains three integersai,biandci. Hereai= 0means that the participant numberididn't manage to accept first problem. If1 ≤ai≤ 120, then the participant numberigot the first problem acceptedaiminutes after the start of the contest and you cannot hack this solution. Finally,- 120 ≤ai≤  - 1means that the participant numberigot the first problem accepted-aiminutes after the start of the contest and you can hack this solution. Similarly,biandciprovide the information regarding second and third problems in the same format.It's guaranteed that integersa1,b1andc1are non-negative.OutputPrint the only integer — the best place you can take at the end of the round.ExamplesInput4120 120 161 61 120-61 61 1200 0 0Output1Input40 0 119-3 -17 -420 7 051 0 0Output2NoteConsider the first sample. If you do not hack any solutions, you will win the contest (scoreboard to the left). However, if you hack the solution of the first problem of the third participant (the only one you can hack), the maximum score for the first problem will change and you will finish second (scoreboard to the right).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "fbd56138", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ participants in a programming contest.
