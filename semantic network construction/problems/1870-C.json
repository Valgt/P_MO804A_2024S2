You are also given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ of size $$$n$$$. It is known that for all $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq k$$$.Define a two-dimensional array $$$b$$$ of size $$$n \\\\times n$$$ as follows: $$$b_{i, j} = \\\\min(a_i, a_j)$$$. Represent array $$$b$$$ as a square, where the upper left cell is $$$b_{1, 1}$$$, rows are numbered from top to bottom from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and columns are numbered from left to right from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Let the color of a cell be the number written in it (for a cell with coordinates $$$(i, j)$$$, this is $$$b_{i, j}$$$).For each color from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, find the smallest rectangle in the array $$$b$$$ containing all cells of this color. Output the sum of width and height of this rectangle.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, k \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the size of array $$$a$$$ and the number of colors.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq k$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$k$$$ numbers: the sums of width and height of the smallest rectangle containing all cells of a color, for each color from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$.ExampleInput52 11 12 21 23 53 2 44 21 2 1 25 31 2 3 2 1Output4  4 2  0 6 6 2 0  8 6  10 6 2NoteIn the first test case, the entire array $$$b$$$ consists of color $$$1$$$, so the smallest rectangle for color $$$1$$$ has a size of $$$2 \\\\times 2$$$, and the sum of its sides is $$$4$$$.In the second test case, the array $$$b$$$ looks like this:1112One of the corner cells has color $$$2$$$, and the other three cells have color $$$1$$$. Therefore, the smallest rectangle for color $$$1$$$ has a size of $$$2 \\\\times 2$$$, and for color $$$2$$$ it is $$$1 \\\\times 1$$$.In the last test case, the array $$$b$$$ looks like this:1111112221123211222111111", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "caf47d33", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers $n$ and $k$.
