Vasya and Isolated Verticestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya has got an undirected graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. This graph doesn't contain any self-loops or multiple edges. Self-loop is an edge connecting a vertex to itself. Multiple edges are a pair of edges such that they connect the same pair of vertices. Since the graph is undirected, the pair of edges $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 1)$$$ is considered to be multiple edges. Isolated vertex of the graph is a vertex such that there is no edge connecting this vertex to any other vertex.Vasya wants to know the minimum and maximum possible number of isolated vertices in an undirected graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges.InputThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m~(1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5, 0 \\\\le m \\\\le \\\\frac{n (n - 1)}{2})$$$.It is guaranteed that there exists a graph without any self-loops or multiple edges with such number of vertices and edges.OutputIn the only line print two numbers $$$min$$$ and $$$max$$$ â€” the minimum and maximum number of isolated vertices, respectively.ExamplesInput4 2Output0 1Input3 1Output1 1NoteIn the first example it is possible to construct a graph with $$$0$$$ isolated vertices: for example, it should contain edges $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(3, 4)$$$. To get one isolated vertex, we may construct a graph with edges $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(1, 3)$$$.In the second example the graph will always contain exactly one isolated vertex.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4c81240c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a number of vertices  $n$ and a number of edges $m$.
