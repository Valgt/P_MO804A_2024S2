Antenna Coveragetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the $$$(Ox)$$$ axis.On this street, there are $$$n$$$ antennas, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th antenna lies on the position $$$x_i$$$ and has an initial scope of $$$s_i$$$: it covers all integer positions inside the interval $$$[x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i]$$$.It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by $$$1$$$, this operation costs $$$1$$$ coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).To modernize the street, we need to make allintegerpositions from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ inclusive covered byat leastone antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside $$$[1; m]$$$, even if it's not required.What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 80$$$ and $$$n \\\\le m \\\\le 100\\\\ 000$$$).The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i \\\\le m$$$ and $$$0 \\\\le s_i \\\\le m$$$).On each position, there is at most one antenna (values $$$x_i$$$ are pairwise distinct).OutputYou have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ inclusive covered by at least one antenna.ExamplesInput3 595 43 2 300 4 554 10Output281Input1 1 1 1Output0Input2 50 20 0 3 1Output30Input5 240 13 0 50 25 60 5 155 70 165 70Output26NoteIn the first example, here is a possible strategy:Increase the scope of the first antenna by $$$40$$$, so that it becomes $$$2 + 40 = 42$$$. This antenna will cover interval $$$[43 - 42; 43 + 42]$$$ which is $$$[1; 85]$$$Increase the scope of the second antenna by $$$210$$$, so that it becomes $$$4 + 210 = 214$$$. This antenna will cover interval $$$[300 - 214; 300 + 214]$$$, which is $$$[86; 514]$$$Increase the scope of the third antenna by $$$31$$$, so that it becomes $$$10 + 31 = 41$$$. This antenna will cover interval $$$[554 - 41; 554 + 41]$$$, which is $$$[513; 595]$$$Total cost is $$$40 + 210 + 31 = 281$$$. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from $$$1$$$ to $$$595$$$ covered by at least one antenna.Note that positions $$$513$$$ and $$$514$$$ are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.â€”In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval $$$[0; 2]$$$ so we have nothing to do.Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position $$$1$$$; positions $$$0$$$ and $$$2$$$ are covered, but it's not important.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "846eb9ea", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ antennas on a line.
