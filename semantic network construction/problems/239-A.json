Valera — very scattered boy, so the first bag of potatoes (it containsxpotatoes) Valera lost. Valera remembers that the total amount of potatoes(x+y)in the two bags, firstly, was not gerater thann, and, secondly, was divisible byk.Help Valera to determine how many potatoes could be in the first bag.
