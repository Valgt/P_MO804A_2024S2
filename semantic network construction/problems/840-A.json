Leha and Functiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLeha like all kinds of strange things. Recently he liked the functionF(n,k). Consider all possiblek-element subsets of the set[1, 2, ...,n]. For subset find minimal element in it.F(n,k)— mathematical expectation of the minimal element among allk-element subsets.But only function does not interest him. He wants to do interesting things with it. Mom brought him two arraysAandB, each consists ofmintegers. For alli,jsuch that1 ≤i,j≤mthe conditionAi≥Bjholds.
