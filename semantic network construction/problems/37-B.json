Computer Gametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutVasya’s elder brother Petya loves playing computer games. In one of his favourite computer games Petya reached the final level where a fight with the boss take place.While playing the game Petya found spell scrolls and now he is about to use them. Let’s describe the way fighting goes on this level:1) The boss has two parameters:max— the initial amount of health andreg— regeneration rate per second.2) Every scroll also has two parameters:powi— spell power measured in percents — the maximal amount of health counted off the initial one, which allows to use the scroll (i.e. if the boss has more thanpowipercent of health the scroll cannot be used); anddmgithe damage per second inflicted upon the boss if the scroll is used. As soon as a scroll is used it disappears and another spell is cast upon the boss that inflictsdmgiof damage per second upon him until the end of the game.During the battle the actions per second are performed in the following order: first the boss gets the damage from all the spells cast upon him, then he regeneratesregof health (at the same time he can’t have more thanmaxof health), then the player may use another scroll (no more than one per second).The boss is considered to be defeated if at the end of a second he has nonpositive (≤ 0) amount of health.Help Petya to determine whether he can win with the set of scrolls available to him and if he can, determine the minimal number of seconds he needs to do it.InputThe first line contains three integersN,maxandreg(1 ≤N,max,reg≤ 1000) –– the amount of scrolls and the parameters of the boss. The nextNlines contain two integerspowianddmgieach — the parameters of thei-th scroll (0 ≤powi≤ 100,1 ≤dmgi≤ 2000).OutputIn case Petya can’t complete this level, output in the single lineNO.Otherwise, output on the first lineYES. On the second line output the minimal time after which the boss can be defeated and the number of used scrolls. In the next lines for each used scroll output space-separated number of seconds passed from the start of the battle to the moment the scroll was used and the number of the scroll. Scrolls are numbered starting from 1 in the input order. The first scroll is considered to be available to be used after0seconds.Output scrolls in the order they were used. It is not allowed to use scrolls after the boss is defeated.ExamplesInput2 10 3100 399 1OutputNOInput2 100 10100 1190 9OutputYES19 20 110 2", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ed2bc94c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There is a boss with maximum health $max$ and regeneration rate $reg$ per second.
