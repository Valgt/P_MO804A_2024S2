Space Navigationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou were dreaming that you are traveling to a planet named Planetforces on your personal spaceship. Unfortunately, its piloting system was corrupted and now you need to fix it in order to reach Planetforces.Space can be represented as the $$$XY$$$ plane. You are starting at point $$$(0, 0)$$$, and Planetforces is located in point $$$(p_x, p_y)$$$.The piloting system of your spaceship follows its list of orders which can be represented as a string $$$s$$$. The system reads $$$s$$$ from left to right. Suppose you are at point $$$(x, y)$$$ and current order is $$$s_i$$$:if $$$s_i = \\\\text{U}$$$, you move to $$$(x, y + 1)$$$;if $$$s_i = \\\\text{D}$$$, you move to $$$(x, y - 1)$$$;if $$$s_i = \\\\text{R}$$$, you move to $$$(x + 1, y)$$$;if $$$s_i = \\\\text{L}$$$, you move to $$$(x - 1, y)$$$.Since string $$$s$$$ could be corrupted, there is a possibility that you won't reach Planetforces in the end. Fortunately,you can delete some orders from $$$s$$$ but you can't change their positions.Can you delete several orders (possibly, zero) from $$$s$$$ in such a way, that you'll reach Planetforces after the system processes all orders?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line in each test case contains two integers $$$p_x$$$ and $$$p_y$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\\\le p_x, p_y \\\\le 10^5$$$; $$$(p_x, p_y) \\\\neq (0, 0)$$$) — the coordinates of Planetforces $$$(p_x, p_y)$$$.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 10^5$$$: $$$|s|$$$ is the length of string $$$s$$$) — the list of orders.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print \"YES\" if you can delete several orders (possibly, zero) from $$$s$$$ in such a way, that you'll reach Planetforces. Otherwise, print \"NO\". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).ExampleInput6 10 5 RRRRRRRRRRUUUUU 1 1 UDDDRLLL -3 -5 LDLDLDDDR 1 2 LLLLUU 3 -2 RDULRLLDR -1 6 RUDURUUUUROutputYES YES YES NO YES NONoteIn the first case, you don't need to modify $$$s$$$, since the given $$$s$$$ will bring you to Planetforces.In the second case, you can delete orders $$$s_2$$$, $$$s_3$$$, $$$s_4$$$, $$$s_6$$$, $$$s_7$$$ and $$$s_8$$$, so $$$s$$$ becomes equal to \"UR\".In the third test case, you have to delete order $$$s_9$$$, otherwise, you won't finish in the position of Planetforces.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "9bb8763c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a starting point $(0,0)$ and a destination point $(p_x, p_y)$.
