Chain Reactiontime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ monsters standing in a row. The $$$i$$$-th monster has $$$a_i$$$ health points.Every second, you can choose onealivemonster and launch a chain lightning at it. The lightning deals $$$k$$$ damage to it, and also spreads to the left (towards decreasing $$$i$$$) and to the right (towards increasing $$$i$$$) toalivemonsters, dealing $$$k$$$ damage to each. When the lightning reaches a dead monster or the beginning/end of the row, it stops. A monster is considered alive if its health points are strictly greater than $$$0$$$.For example, consider the following scenario: there are three monsters with health equal to $$$[5, 2, 7]$$$, and $$$k = 3$$$. You can kill them all in $$$4$$$ seconds:launch a chain lightning at the $$$3$$$-rd monster, then their health values are $$$[2, -1, 4]$$$;launch a chain lightning at the $$$1$$$-st monster, then their health values are $$$[-1, -1, 4]$$$;launch a chain lightning at the $$$3$$$-rd monster, then their health values are $$$[-1, -1, 1]$$$;launch a chain lightning at the $$$3$$$-th monster, then their health values are $$$[-1, -1, -2]$$$.For each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$\\\\max(a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n)$$$, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes to kill all the monsters.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of monsters.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the health points of the $$$i$$$-th monster.OutputFor each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$\\\\max(a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n)$$$, output the minimum number of seconds it takes to kill all the monsters.ExamplesInput35 2 7Output10 6 4 3 2 2 1Input47 7 7 7Output7 4 3 2 2 2 1Input101 9 7 6 2 4 7 8 1 3Output17 9 5 4 3 3 3 2 1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5c525a65", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have $n$ monsters in a line, each with a certain amount of health points ($a_i$).
