Tanya and Passwordtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutWhile dad was at work, a little girl Tanya decided to play with dad's password to his secret database. Dad's password is a string consisting ofn+ 2characters. She has written all the possiblenthree-letter continuous substrings of the password on pieces of paper, one for each piece of paper, and threw the password out. Each three-letter substring was written the number of times it occurred in the password. Thus, Tanya ended up withnpieces of paper.Then Tanya realized that dad will be upset to learn about her game and decided to restore the password or at least any string corresponding to the final set of three-letter strings. You have to help her in this difficult task. We know that dad's password consisted of lowercase and uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet and digits. Uppercase and lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet are considered distinct.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 2·105), the number of three-letter substrings Tanya got.Nextnlines contain three letters each, forming the substring of dad's password. Each character in the input is a lowercase or uppercase Latin letter or a digit.OutputIf Tanya made a mistake somewhere during the game and the strings that correspond to the given set of substrings don't exist, print \"NO\".If it is possible to restore the string that corresponds to given set of substrings, print \"YES\", and then print any suitable password option.ExamplesInput5acaabaabacabbacOutputYESabacabaInput4abcbCbcb1b13OutputNOInput7aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaOutputYESaaaaaaaaa", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "da1812e7", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of $n$ three-letter strings.
