Field expansiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn one of the games Arkady is fond of the game process happens on a rectangular field. In the game process Arkady can buy extensions for his field, each extension enlarges one of the field sizes in a particular number of times. Formally, there arenextensions, thei-th of them multiplies the width or the length (by Arkady's choice) byai. Each extension can't be used more than once, the extensions can be used in any order.Now Arkady's field has sizeh×w. He wants to enlarge it so that it is possible to place a rectangle of sizea×bon it (along the width or along the length, with sides parallel to the field sides). Find the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal.InputThe first line contains five integersa,b,h,wandn(1 ≤a,b,h,w,n≤ 100 000) — the sizes of the rectangle needed to be placed, the initial sizes of the field and the number of available extensions.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(2 ≤ai≤ 100 000), whereaiequals the integer a side multiplies by when thei-th extension is applied.OutputPrint the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal. If it is not possible to place the rectangle on the field with all extensions, print-1. If the rectangle can be placed on the initial field, print0.ExamplesInput3 3 2 4 42 5 4 10Output1Input3 3 3 3 52 3 5 4 2Output0Input5 5 1 2 32 2 3Output-1Input3 4 1 1 32 3 2Output3NoteIn the first example it is enough to use any of the extensions available.
