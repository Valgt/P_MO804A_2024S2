John Snow has an army consisting ofnsoldiers. While the rest of the world is fighting for the Iron Throne, he is going to get ready for the attack of the White Walkers.He has created a method to know how strong his army is. Let thei-th soldier’s strength beai. For somekhe callsi1,i2, ...,ika clan ifi1<i2<i3< ... <ikandgcd(ai1,ai2, ...,aik) > 1. He calls the strength of that clank·gcd(ai1,ai2, ...,aik). Then he defines the strength of his army by the sum of strengths of all possible clans.Your task is to find the strength of his army. As the number may be very large, you have to print it modulo1000000007(109+ 7).Greatest common divisor (gcd) of a sequence of integers is the maximum possible integer so that each element of the sequence is divisible by it.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 200000) — the size of the army.The second line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 1000000) — denoting the strengths of his soldiers.OutputPrint one integer — the strength of John Snow's army modulo1000000007(109+ 7).ExamplesInput33 3 1Output12Input42 3 4 6Output39NoteIn the first sample the clans are{1}, {2}, {1, 2}so the answer will be1·3 + 1·3 + 2·3 = 12", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "0ceadfe5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, where each integer represents the strength of a soldier.  \n\nA group of soldiers is called a \"clan\" if the indices of the soldiers are in strictly increasing order.
