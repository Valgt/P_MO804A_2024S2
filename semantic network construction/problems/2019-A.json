Find the maximum score you can get.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 1000$$$) — the given array.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible score you can get after coloring some elements red according to the statement.ExampleInput435 4 534 5 4103 3 3 3 4 1 2 3 4 5917 89 92 42 29 92 14 70 45Output7 6 10 97NoteIn the first test case, you can color the array as follows: $$$[\\\\color{red}{5}, 4, \\\\color{red}{5}]$$$. Your score is $$$\\\\max([5, 5]) + \\\\text{size}([5, 5]) = 5+2 = 7$$$. This is the maximum score you can get.In the second test case, you can color the array as follows: $$$[\\\\color{red}{4}, 5, \\\\color{red}{4}]$$$. Your score is $$$\\\\max([4, 4]) + \\\\text{size}([4, 4]) = 4+2 = 6$$$. This is the maximum score you can get.In the third test case, you can color the array as follows: $$$[\\\\color{red}{3}, 3, \\\\color{red}{3}, 3, \\\\color{red}{4}, 1, 2, \\\\color{red}{3}, 4, \\\\color{red}{5}]$$$. Your score is $$$\\\\max([3, 3, 4, 3, 5]) + \\\\text{size}([3, 3, 4, 3, 5]) = 5+5 = 10$$$.
