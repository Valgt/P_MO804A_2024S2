Make k Equaltime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given the array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ elements and the integer $$$k \\\\le n$$$.You want to obtainat least$$$k$$$ equal elements in the array $$$a$$$. In one move, you can make one of the following two operations:Takeoneof the minimum elements of the array and increase its value by one (more formally, if the minimum value of $$$a$$$ is $$$mn$$$ then you choose such index $$$i$$$ that $$$a_i = mn$$$ and set $$$a_i := a_i + 1$$$);takeoneof the maximum elements of the array and decrease its value by one (more formally, if the maximum value of $$$a$$$ is $$$mx$$$ then you choose such index $$$i$$$ that $$$a_i = mx$$$ and set $$$a_i := a_i - 1$$$).Your task is to calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtainat least$$$k$$$ equal elements in the array.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$ and the required number of equal elements.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum number of moves required to obtainat least$$$k$$$ equal elements in the array.ExamplesInput6 5 1 2 2 4 2 3Output3Input7 5 3 3 2 1 1 1 3Output4", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7c765326", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers ($a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$).
