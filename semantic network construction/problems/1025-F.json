Two triangles aredisjointif there is no point on the plane that belongs to both triangles.You are given $$$n$$$ points on the plane. No two points coincide and no three points are collinear.Find the number of different ways to choose two disjoint triangles with vertices in the given points. Two ways which differ only in order of triangles or in order of vertices inside triangles are considered equal.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$6 \\\\le n \\\\le 2000$$$) – the number of points.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$|x_i|, |y_i| \\\\le 10^9$$$) – the coordinates of a point.No two points coincide and no three points are collinear.OutputPrint one integer – the number of ways to choose two disjoint triangles.ExamplesInput61 12 24 64 57 25 3Output6Input70 -1000000000-5 -55 -5-5 05 0-2 22 2Output21NoteIn the first example there are six pairs of disjoint triangles, they are shown on the picture below.All other pairs of triangles are not disjoint, for example the following pair:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c514f829", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ points on a plane, where no three points are on the same line.
