Singers' Tourtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output$$$n$$$ towns are arranged in a circle sequentially. The towns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in clockwise order. In the $$$i$$$-th town, there lives a singer with a repertoire of $$$a_i$$$ minutes for each $$$i \\\\in [1, n]$$$.Each singer visited all $$$n$$$ towns in clockwise order, starting with the town he lives in, and gave exactly one concert in each town. In addition, in each town, the $$$i$$$-th singer got inspired and came up with a song that lasts $$$a_i$$$ minutes. The song was added to his repertoire so that he could perform it in the rest of the cities.Hence, for the $$$i$$$-th singer, the concert in the $$$i$$$-th town will last $$$a_i$$$ minutes, in the $$$(i + 1)$$$-th town the concert will last $$$2 \\\\cdot a_i$$$ minutes, ..., in the $$$((i + k) \\\\bmod n + 1)$$$-th town the duration of the concert will be $$$(k + 2) \\\\cdot a_i$$$, ..., in the town $$$((i + n - 2) \\\\bmod n + 1)$$$ — $$$n \\\\cdot a_i$$$ minutes.You are given an array of $$$b$$$ integer numbers, where $$$b_i$$$ is the total duration of concerts in the $$$i$$$-th town. Reconstruct any correct sequence ofpositiveintegers $$$a$$$ or say that it is impossible.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 4 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of cities. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 10^{9}$$$) — the total duration of concerts in $$$i$$$-th city.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the answer as follows:If there is no suitable sequence $$$a$$$, printNO. Otherwise, on the first line printYES, on the next line print the sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, where $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^{9}$$$) is the initial duration of repertoire of the $$$i$$$-th singer.
