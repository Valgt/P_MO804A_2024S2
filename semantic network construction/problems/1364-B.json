The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, $$$\\\\ldots$$$, $$$p_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$p_i$$$ are distinct) — the elements of the permutation $$$p$$$.The sum of $$$n$$$ across the test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, the first line should contain the length of the found subsequence, $$$k$$$. The second line should contain $$$s_1$$$, $$$s_2$$$, $$$\\\\ldots$$$, $$$s_k$$$ — its elements.If multiple subsequences satisfy these conditions, you are allowed to find any of them.ExampleInput2 3 3 2 1 4 1 3 4 2Output2 3 1  3 1 4 2NoteIn the first test case, there are $$$4$$$ subsequences of length at least $$$2$$$:$$$[3,2]$$$ which gives us $$$|3-2|=1$$$.$$$[3,1]$$$ which gives us $$$|3-1|=2$$$.$$$[2,1]$$$ which gives us $$$|2-1|=1$$$.$$$[3,2,1]$$$ which gives us $$$|3-2|+|2-1|=2$$$.So the answer is either $$$[3,1]$$$ or $$$[3,2,1]$$$. Since we want the subsequence to be as short as possible, the answer is $$$[3,1]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4b4721f0", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of numbers called a permutation.
