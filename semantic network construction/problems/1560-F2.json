Nearest Beautiful Number (hard version)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt is a complicated version of problem F1. The difference between them is the constraints (F1: $$$k \\\\le 2$$$, F2: $$$k \\\\le 10$$$).You are given an integer $$$n$$$. Find the minimum integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$x \\\\ge n$$$ and the number $$$x$$$ is $$$k$$$-beautiful.A number is called $$$k$$$-beautifulif its decimal representation having no leading zeroes contains no more than $$$k$$$ different digits. E.g. if $$$k = 2$$$, the numbers $$$3434443$$$, $$$55550$$$, $$$777$$$ and $$$21$$$ are $$$k$$$-beautifulwhereas the numbers $$$120$$$, $$$445435$$$ and $$$998244353$$$ are not.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.
