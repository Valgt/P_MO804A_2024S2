You Are Given a WASD-string...time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a string $$$s$$$ — a sequence of commands for your toy robot. The robot is placed in some cell of arectangulargrid. He can perform four commands:'W' — move one cell up;'S' — move one cell down;'A' — move one cell left;'D' — move one cell right.Let $$$Grid(s)$$$ be the grid of minimum possible area such that there is a position in the grid where you can place the robot in such a way that it will not fall from the grid while running the sequence of commands $$$s$$$. For example, if $$$s = \\\\text{DSAWWAW}$$$ then $$$Grid(s)$$$ is the $$$4 \\\\times 3$$$ grid:you can place the robot in the cell $$$(3, 2)$$$;the robot performs the command 'D' and moves to $$$(3, 3)$$$;the robot performs the command 'S' and moves to $$$(4, 3)$$$;the robot performs the command 'A' and moves to $$$(4, 2)$$$;the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to $$$(3, 2)$$$;the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to $$$(2, 2)$$$;the robot performs the command 'A' and moves to $$$(2, 1)$$$;the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to $$$(1, 1)$$$.You have $$$4$$$ extra letters: one 'W', one 'A', one 'S', one 'D'. You'd like to insertat most one of these lettersin any position of sequence $$$s$$$ to minimize the area of $$$Grid(s)$$$.What is the minimum area of $$$Grid(s)$$$ you can achieve?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le T \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of queries.Next $$$T$$$ lines contain queries: one per line. This line contains single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$s_i \\\\in \\\\{\\\\text{W}, \\\\text{A}, \\\\text{S}, \\\\text{D}\\\\}$$$) — the sequence of commands.It's guaranteed that the total length of $$$s$$$ over all queries doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$T$$$ integers: one per query. For each query print the minimum area of $$$Grid(s)$$$ you can achieve.ExampleInput3 DSAWWAW D WAOutput8 2 4NoteIn the first query you have to get string $$$\\\\text{DSAWW}\\\\underline{D}\\\\text{AW}$$$.In second and third queries you can not decrease the area of $$$Grid(s)$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "97b48f10", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string of commands representing movements: 'W' (up), 'S' (down), 'A' (left), 'D' (right).  \n\nFind the smallest possible rectangular grid size that can accommodate these movements without the robot going out of bounds.\n\nYou have four extra commands ('W', 'A', 'S', 'D') that you can insert into the string at most once.  \n\nDetermine the minimum grid size achievable after inserting one of these extra commands.\n\nInput:\n\n* The first line contains the number of test cases,  *T*.\n* Each subsequent line contains a string of commands *s*.\n\nOutput:\n\n* For each test case, print the minimum grid size."}, {"prompt_md5": "5dbab444", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a sequence of commands representing movements (up, down, left, right).
