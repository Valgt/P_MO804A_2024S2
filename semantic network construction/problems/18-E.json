The following restrictions are set:In each row at most two different colours can be used.No two adjacent squares can be painted the same colour.Pay attention, please, that in one column more than two different colours can be used.Berland's government took a decision to introduce changes into their country's flag in accordance with the new standard, at the same time they want these changes to be minimal. By the given description of Berland's flag you should find out the minimum amount of squares that need to be painted different colour to make the flag meet the new ISO standard. You are as well to build one of the possible variants of the new Berland's flag.InputThe first input line contains 2 integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 500) — amount of rows and columns in Berland's flag respectively. Then there follows the flag's description: each of the followingnlines containsmcharacters. Each character is a letter fromatoz, and it stands for the colour of the corresponding square.OutputIn the first line output the minimum amount of squares that need to be repainted to make the flag meet the new ISO standard. The followingnlines should contain one of the possible variants of the new flag. Don't forget that the variant of the flag, proposed by you, should be derived from the old flag with the minimum amount of repainted squares. If the answer isn't unique, output any.ExamplesInput3 4aaaabbbbccccOutput6ababbabaacacInput3 3abaabazzzOutput4abababzbz", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b1574203", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a flag represented as a grid of $n \\times m$ squares, where each square is colored with one of 26 colors (represented by letters from 'a' to 'z').  \n\nThe flag must follow these rules:\n\n* Each row can have at most two different colors.\n* No two adjacent squares can have the same color.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of squares that need to be repainted to make the flag follow these rules.
