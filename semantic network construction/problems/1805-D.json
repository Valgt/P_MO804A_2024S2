A Wide, Wide Graphtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree (a connected graph without cycles) with $$$n$$$ vertices.Consider a fixed integer $$$k$$$. Then, the graph $$$G_k$$$ is an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices, where an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ exists if and only if the distance between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in the given tree isat least$$$k$$$.For each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, print the number of connected components in the graph $$$G_k$$$.InputThe first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the graph.Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u, v \\\\le n$$$), denoting an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in the tree. It is guaranteed that these edges form a valid tree.OutputOutput $$$n$$$ integers: the number of connected components in the graph $$$G_k$$$ for each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.ExamplesInput6 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 3 6Output1 1 2 4 6 6Input5 1 2 2 3 3 4 3 5Output1 1 3 5 5NoteIn the first example: If $$$k=1$$$, the graph has an edge between each pair of vertices, so it has one component. If $$$k=4$$$, the graph has only edges $$$4 \\\\leftrightarrow 6$$$ and $$$5 \\\\leftrightarrow 6$$$, so the graph has $$$4$$$ components.In the second example: when $$$k=1$$$ or $$$k=2$$$ the graph has one component. When $$$k=3$$$ the graph $$$G_k$$$ splits into $$$3$$$ components: one component has vertices $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, and two more components contain one vertex each.
