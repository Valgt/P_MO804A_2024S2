Summarize to the Power of Twotime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ is called good if, for each element $$$a_i$$$, there exists an element $$$a_j$$$ ($$$i \\\\ne j$$$) such that $$$a_i+a_j$$$ is a power of two (that is, $$$2^d$$$ for some non-negative integer $$$d$$$).For example, the following sequences are good:$$$[5, 3, 11]$$$ (for example, for $$$a_1=5$$$ we can choose $$$a_2=3$$$. Note that their sum is a power of two. Similarly, such an element can be found for $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$),$$$[1, 1, 1, 1023]$$$,$$$[7, 39, 89, 25, 89]$$$,$$$[]$$$.Note that, by definition, an empty sequence (with a length of $$$0$$$) is good.For example, the following sequences are not good:$$$[16]$$$ (for $$$a_1=16$$$, it is impossible to find another element $$$a_j$$$ such that their sum is a power of two),$$$[4, 16]$$$ (for $$$a_1=4$$$, it is impossible to find another element $$$a_j$$$ such that their sum is a power of two),$$$[1, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8]$$$ (for $$$a_3=2$$$, it is impossible to find another element $$$a_j$$$ such that their sum is a power of two).You are given a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$. What is the minimum number of elements you need to remove to make it good? You can delete an arbitrary set of elements.InputThe first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 120000$$$) â€” the length of the given sequence.The second line contains the sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint the minimum number of elements needed to be removed from the given sequence in order to make it good. It is possible that you need to delete all $$$n$$$ elements, make it empty, and thus get a good sequence.ExamplesInput64 7 1 5 4 9Output1Input51 2 3 4 5Output2Input116Output1Input41 1 1 1023Output0NoteIn the first example, it is enough to delete one element $$$a_4=5$$$. The remaining elements form the sequence $$$[4, 7, 1, 4, 9]$$$, which is good.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ad3a872c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of integers.
