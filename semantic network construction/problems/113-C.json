Double Happinesstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test128 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutOn the math lesson a teacher asked each pupil to come up with his own lucky numbers. As a fan of number theory Peter chose prime numbers. Bob was more original. He said that numbertis his lucky number, if it can be represented as:t=a2+b2,wherea,bare arbitrary positive integers.Now, the boys decided to find out how many days of the interval[l,r](l≤r) are suitable for pair programming. They decided that the dayi(l≤i≤r) is suitable for pair programming if and only if the numberiis lucky for Peter and lucky for Bob at the same time. Help the boys to find the number of such days.InputThe first line of the input contains integer numbersl,r(1 ≤l,r≤ 3·108).OutputIn the only line print the number of days on the segment[l,r], which are lucky for Peter and Bob at the same time.ExamplesInput3 5Output1Input6 66Output7", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "fef450f3", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a range of numbers, count how many numbers in the range can be expressed as the sum of two squares and are also prime."}, {"prompt_md5": "0531921e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given two integers $l$ and $r$ (where $1 \\le l \\le r \\le 3 \\cdot 10^8$), count the number of days between $l$ and $r$ (inclusive) that are considered \"lucky\".  \n\nA day is considered lucky if it can be represented as the sum of two perfect squares: $i = a^2 + b^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers."}]}
