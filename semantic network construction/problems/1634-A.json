Reverse and Concatenatetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputReal stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time.— Terry Pratchett,Hogfather, DiscworldYou are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a number $$$k$$$. Let's denote by $$$rev(s)$$$ the reversed string $$$s$$$ (i.e. $$$rev(s) = s_n s_{n-1} ... s_1$$$). You can apply one of the two kinds of operations to the string:replace the string $$$s$$$ with $$$s + rev(s)$$$replace the string $$$s$$$ with $$$rev(s) + s$$$How many different strings can you get as a result of performingexactly$$$k$$$ operations (possibly of different kinds) on the original string $$$s$$$?In this statement we denoted the concatenation of strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ as $$$s + t$$$. In other words, $$$s + t = s_1 s_2 ... s_n t_1 t_2 ... t_m$$$, where $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ are the lengths of strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ respectively.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — number of test cases. Next $$$2 \\\\cdot t$$$ lines contain $$$t$$$ test cases:The first line of a test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$, $$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le 1000$$$) — the length of the string and the number of operations respectively.The second string of a test case contains one string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.OutputFor each test case, print the answer (that is, the number of different strings that you can get after exactly $$$k$$$ operations) on a separate line.It can be shown that the answer does not exceed $$$10^9$$$ under the given constraints.ExampleInput43 2aab3 3aab7 1abacaba2 0abOutput2 2 1 1NoteIn the first test case of the example:After the first operation the string $$$s$$$ can become eitheraabbaaorbaaaab.
