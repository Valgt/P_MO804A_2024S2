Pudding Monsterstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn this problem you will meet the simplified model of game Pudding Monsters.An important process in developing any game is creating levels. A game field in Pudding Monsters is ann×nrectangular grid,nof its cells contain monsters and some other cells contain game objects. The gameplay is about moving the monsters around the field. When two monsters are touching each other, they glue together into a single big one (as they are from pudding, remember?).Statistics showed that the most interesting maps appear if initially each row and each column contains exactly one monster and the rest of map specifics is set up by the correct positioning of the other game objects.A technique that's widely used to make the development process more efficient is reusing the available resources. For example, if there is a largen×nmap, you can choose in it a smallerk×ksquare part, containing exactlykmonsters and suggest it as a simplified version of the original map.You wonder how many ways there are to choose in the initial map ak×k(1 ≤k≤n) square fragment, containing exactlykpudding monsters. Calculate this number.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 3 × 105) — the size of the initial field.Nextnlines contain the coordinates of the cells initially containing monsters. Thei-th of the next lines contains two numbersri,ci(1 ≤ri,ci≤n) — the row number and the column number of the cell that initially contains thei-th monster.It is guaranteed that allriare distinct numbers and allciare distinct numbers.OutputPrint the number of distinct square fragments of the original field that can form a new map.ExamplesInput51 14 33 22 45 5Output10", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7a40d273", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a square grid of size $n \\times n$.
