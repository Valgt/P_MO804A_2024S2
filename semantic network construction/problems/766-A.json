Mahmoud and Longest Uncommon Subsequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWhile Mahmoud and Ehab were practicing for IOI, they found a problem which name was Longest common subsequence. They solved it, and then Ehab challenged Mahmoud with another problem.Given two stringsaandb, find the length of their longest uncommon subsequence, which is the longest string that is a subsequence of one of them and not a subsequence of the other.A subsequence of some string is a sequence of characters that appears in the same order in the string, The appearances don't have to be consecutive, for example, strings \"ac\", \"bc\", \"abc\" and \"a\" are subsequences of string \"abc\" while strings \"abbc\" and \"acb\" are not. The empty string is a subsequence of any string. Any string is a subsequence of itself.InputThe first line contains stringa, and the second line — stringb. Both of these strings are non-empty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is not bigger than105characters.OutputIf there's no uncommon subsequence, print \"-1\". Otherwise print the length of the longest uncommon subsequence ofaandb.ExamplesInputabcddefghOutput5InputaaOutput-1NoteIn the first example: you can choose \"defgh\" from stringbas it is the longest subsequence of stringbthat doesn't appear as a subsequence of stringa.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "77f51b2e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given two strings $a$ and $b$, find the length of the longest subsequence that is a subsequence of one of the strings but not the other. \n\nA subsequence of a string is a sequence of characters that appears in the same order in the string, but not necessarily consecutively. \n\nIf there is no such subsequence, print $-1$."}, {"prompt_md5": "65baabfb", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given two strings, find the length of the longest sequence of characters that appears in one string but not the other.
