Misha and XORtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutAfter Misha's birthday he had many large numbers left, scattered across the room. Now it's time to clean up and Misha needs to put them in a basket. He ordered this task to his pet robot that agreed to complete the task at certain conditions. Before the robot puts a numberxto the basket, Misha should answer the question: is it possible to choose one or multiple numbers that already are in the basket, such that their XOR sum equalsx?If the answer is positive, you also need to give the indexes of these numbers. If there are multiple options of choosing numbers, you are allowed to choose any correct option. After Misha's answer the robot puts the number to the basket.Initially the basket is empty. Each integer you put in the basket takes some number. The first integer you put into the basket take number0, the second integer takes number1and so on.Misha needs to clean up the place as soon as possible but unfortunately, he isn't that good at mathematics. He asks you to help him.InputThe first line contains numberm(1 ≤m≤ 2000), showing how many numbers are scattered around the room.The nextmlines contain the numbers in the order in which the robot puts them in the basket. Each number is a positive integer strictly less than10600that doesn't contain leading zeroes.OutputFor each number either print a0on the corresponding line, if the number cannot be represented as a XOR sum of numbers that are in the basket, or print integerkshowing how many numbers are in the representation and the indexes of these numbers. Separate the numbers by spaces. Each number can occur in the representation at most once.ExamplesInput77654321Output0003 0 1 22 1 22 0 22 0 1Input255Output01 0NoteThe XOR sum of numbers is the result of bitwise sum of numbers modulo 2.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "91a8325e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of integers.
