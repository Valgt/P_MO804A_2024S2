The casting will last $$$q$$$ days. On the $$$i$$$th of the days, Kostya and Zhenya want to find two people on the segment from $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ who are most suitable for their band. Since \"Day movers\" are doing a modern art, musical skills are not important to them and they look only at other signs: they want the height difference between two people to be as small as possible.Help them, and for each day, find the minimum difference in the growth of people from the casting on this segment!InputIn the first line you are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 3 \\\\cdot 10^5, 1 \\\\leq q \\\\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of people who came to the casting and the number of casting days.In the second line, you are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq n$$$) — the growth of each of the candidates.It is also guaranteed that all $$$a_i$$$are different.The following $$$q$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq l_i < r_i \\\\leq n$$$) — a segment of people on the $$$i$$$th day of casting.OutputOutput $$$q$$$ lines. In the $$$i$$$-th line there should be a minimum height difference between the two candidates on the segment on the $$$i$$$-th day of casting.ExamplesInput3 31 3 21 22 31 3Output2 1 1Input5 34 1 5 3 21 23 42 4Output3 2 2Input7 42 6 1 7 3 5 44 61 23 61 3Output2 4 2 1NoteIn the first example, the minimum difference on the segment $$$[1, 2]$$$ is $$$2$$$, on the segment $$$[2, 3]$$$ — $$$1$$$, on the segment $$$[1, 3]$$$ is also $$$1$$$.In the third example, the numbers with the minimum difference on the segment $$$[4, 6]$$$ are $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ ($$$5 - 3 = 2$$$). On the segment $$$[1, 2]$$$, the numbers with the minimum difference are $$$2$$$ and $$$6$$$ ($$$6 - 2 = 4$$$). On the segment $$$[3, 6]$$$, the numbers with the minimum difference are $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ ($$$3 - 1 = 2$$$). On the segment $$$[1, 3]$$$, the minimum difference is formed by the numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ ($$$2 - 1 = 1$$$).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d0980690", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, representing the heights of $n$ people.
