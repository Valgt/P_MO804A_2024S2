Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case is characterized by one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$).OutputFor each test case, output:-1, if the required matrix does not exist;the required matrix, otherwise (any such matrix if many of them exist).The matrix should be outputted as $$$n$$$ lines, where each line contains $$$n$$$ integers.ExampleInput3 1 2 3Output1 -1 2 9 7 4 6 3 1 8 5", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "51a9f4ca", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a number  $n$.
