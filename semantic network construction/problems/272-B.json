Dima and Sequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutDima got into number sequences. Now he's got sequencea1,a2, ...,an, consisting ofnpositive integers. Also, Dima has got a functionf(x), which can be defined with the following recurrence:f(0) = 0;f(2·x) =f(x);f(2·x+ 1) =f(x) + 1.Dima wonders, how many pairs of indexes(i,j)(1 ≤i<j≤n)are there, such thatf(ai) =f(aj). Help him, count the number of such pairs.InputThe first line contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 105). The second line containsnpositive integersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109).The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.OutputIn a single line print the answer to the problem.Please, don't use the%lldspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers inC++.
