New Year and Boolean Bridgestime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYour friend has a hidden directed graph withnnodes.Letf(u,v)be true if there is a directed path from nodeuto nodev, and false otherwise. For each pair of distinct nodes,u,v, you know at least one of the three statements is true:Here AND, OR and XOR mean AND, OR and exclusive OR operations, respectively.You are given annbynmatrix saying which one of the three statements holds for each pair of vertices. The entry in theu-th row andv-th column has a single character.If the first statement holds, this is represented by the character 'A'.If the second holds, this is represented by the character 'O'.If the third holds, this is represented by the character 'X'.The diagonal of this matrix will only contain the character '-'.Note that it is possible that a pair of nodes may satisfy multiple statements, in which case, the character given will represent one of the true statements for that pair. This matrix is also guaranteed to be symmetric.You would like to know if there is a directed graph that is consistent with this matrix. If it is impossible, print the integer-1. Otherwise, print the minimum number of edges that could be consistent with this information.InputThe first line will contain an integern(1 ≤n≤ 47), the number of nodes.The nextnlines will containncharacters each: the matrix of what you know about the graph connectivity in the format described in the statement.OutputPrint the minimum number of edges that is consistent with the given information, or-1if it is impossible.ExamplesInput4-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-Output4Input3-XXX-XXX-Output2NoteSample 1: The hidden graph is a strongly connected graph.
