Thecostof the tree is the minimum of these numbers.What can be the maximum cost of the tree?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v, u \\\\le n$$$) — the description of an edge.The given edges form a tree. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase print a single integer — the maximum possible cost of the tree.ExampleInput441 22 33 451 21 31 41 531 33 273 22 57 53 11 61 4Output4 1 3 3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "958264be", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ vertices.
