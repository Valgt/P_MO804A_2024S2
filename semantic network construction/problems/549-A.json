Face Detectiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe developers of Looksery have to write an efficient algorithm that detects faces on a picture. Unfortunately, they are currently busy preparing a contest for you, so you will have to do it for them.In this problem an image is a rectangular table that consists of lowercase Latin letters. A face on the image is a2 × 2square, such that from the four letters of this square you can make word \"face\".You need to write a program that determines the number of faces on the image. The squares that correspond to the faces can overlap.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers,nandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 50) — the height and the width of the image, respectively.Nextnlines define the image. Each line containsmlowercase Latin letters.OutputIn the single line print the number of faces on the image.ExamplesInput4 4xxxxxfaxxcexxxxxOutput1Input4 2xxcfaexxOutput1Input2 3faccefOutput2Input1 4faceOutput0NoteIn the first sample the image contains a single face, located in a square with the upper left corner at the second line and the second column:In the second sample the image also contains exactly one face, its upper left corner is at the second row and the first column.In the third sample two faces are shown:In the fourth sample the image has no faces on it.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c4de1c16", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a rectangular grid of lowercase letters.
