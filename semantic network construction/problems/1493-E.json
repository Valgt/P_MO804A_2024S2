The binary representation of $$$r$$$ does not contain any extra leading zeros (if $$$r=0$$$, the binary representation of it consists of a single zero). The binary representation of $$$l$$$ is preceded with leading zeros so that its length is equal to $$$n$$$.OutputIn a single line output the value of $$$f(l, r)$$$ for the given pair of $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ in binary representation without extra leading zeros.ExamplesInput7 0010011 1111010Output1111111Input4 1010 1101Output1101NoteIn sample test case $$$l=19$$$, $$$r=122$$$. $$$f(x,y)$$$ is maximal and is equal to $$$127$$$, with $$$x=27$$$, $$$y=100$$$, for example.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1512a1b2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ represented in binary form. \n\nDefine a function $g(x, y)$ as the bitwise XOR of all integers from $x$ to $y$ inclusive ($x \\oplus (x+1) \\oplus ... \\oplus (y-1) \\oplus y$).\n\nDefine a function $f(l, r)$ as the maximum value of $g(x, y)$ where $l \\le x \\le y \\le r$.\n\nOutput the value of $f(l, r)$ in binary form. \n\n\n**Input:**\n\n* The first line contains an integer $n$ (1 ≤ $n$ ≤ 10⁶) representing the length of the binary representation of $r$.\n* The second line contains the binary representation of $l$ as a string of length $n$ consisting of 0s and 1s (0 ≤ $l$ < 2ⁿ).\n* The third line contains the binary representation of $r$ as a string of length $n$ consisting of 0s and 1s (0 ≤ $r$ < 2ⁿ).\n\n**Output:**\n\n* Output the value of $f(l, r)$ in binary form without extra leading zeros."}, {"prompt_md5": "3db2a901", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given two numbers represented in binary.
