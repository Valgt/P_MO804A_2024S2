The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x < y \\\\le 1000,3 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$).OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$.
