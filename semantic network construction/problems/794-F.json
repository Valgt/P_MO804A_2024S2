Leha and security systemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBankopolis, the city you already know, finally got a new bank opened! Unfortunately, its security system is not yet working fine... Meanwhile hacker Leha arrived in Bankopolis and decided to test the system!Bank hasncells for clients' money. A sequence fromnnumbersa1,a2, ...,andescribes the amount of money each client has. Leha wants to make requests to the database of the bank, finding out the total amount of money on some subsegments of the sequence and changing values of the sequence on some subsegments. Using a bug in the system, Leha can requests two types of queries to the database:1 l r x ydenoting that Leha changes each digitxto digityin each element of sequenceai, for whichl≤i≤ris holds. For example, if we change in number11984381digit8to4, we get11944341. It's worth noting that Leha, in order to stay in the shadow, never changes digits in the database to0, i.e.y≠ 0.2 l rdenoting that Leha asks to calculate and print the sum of such elements of sequenceai, for whichl≤i≤rholds.As Leha is a white-hat hacker, he don't want to test this vulnerability on a real database. You are to write a similar database for Leha to test.InputThe first line of input contains two integersnandq(1 ≤n≤ 105,1 ≤q≤ 105) denoting amount of cells in the bank and total amount of queries respectively.The following line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai< 109) denoting the amount of money in each cell initially. These integers do not contain leading zeros.Each of the followingqlines has one of the formats:1 l r x y(1 ≤l≤r≤n,0 ≤x≤ 9,1 ≤y≤ 9), denoting Leha asks to change each digitxon digityfor each elementaiof the sequence for whichl≤i≤rholds;2 l r(1 ≤l≤r≤n), denoting you have to calculate and print the sum of elementsaifor whichl≤i≤rholds.OutputFor each second type query print a single number denoting the required sum.ExamplesInput5 538 43 4 12 701 1 3 4 82 2 41 4 5 0 81 2 5 8 72 1 5Output103207Input5 525 36 39 40 8991 1 3 2 72 1 21 3 5 9 11 4 4 0 92 1 5Output1111002NoteLet's look at the example testcase.Initially the sequence is[38, 43, 4, 12, 70].After the first change each digit equal to4becomes8for each element with index in interval[1; 3]. Thus, the new sequence is[38, 83, 8, 12, 70].The answer for the first sum's query is the sum in the interval[2; 4], which equal83 + 8 + 12 = 103, so the answer to this query is103.The sequence becomes[38, 83, 8, 12, 78]after the second change and[38, 73, 7, 12, 77]after the third.The answer for the second sum's query is38 + 73 + 7 + 12 + 77 = 207.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "59c87fb0", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ integers, $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
