Josuke and Complete Graphtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputJosuke received a huge undirected weighted complete$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ graph $$$G$$$ as a gift from his grandfather. The graph contains $$$10^{18}$$$ vertices. The peculiarity of the gift is that the weight of the edge between the different vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ is equal to $$$\\\\gcd(u, v)^\\\\ddagger$$$. Josuke decided to experiment and make a new graph $$$G'$$$. To do this, he chooses two integers $$$l \\\\le r$$$ and deletes all vertices except such vertices $$$v$$$ that $$$l \\\\le v \\\\le r$$$, and also deletes all the edges except between the remaining vertices.Now Josuke is wondering how many different weights are there in $$$G'$$$. Since their count turned out to be huge, he asks for your help.$$$^\\\\dagger$$$ A complete graph is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is adjacent.$$$^\\\\ddagger$$$ $$$\\\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes thegreatest common divisor (GCD)of the numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two numbers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le 10^{18}$$$, $$$l \\\\le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case print a single number — the number of different weights among the remaining edges.ExampleInput72 416 242 61 103 32562 2568125 100090Output2 6 3 5 0 5 50045NoteThe graph $$$G'$$$ for the first test case.The picture above shows that the graph has $$$2$$$ different weights.In the fifth test case, there is only one vertex from which no edges originate, so the answer is $$$0$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "924096d5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a complete graph with $10^{18}$ vertices.
