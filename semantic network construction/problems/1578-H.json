Higher Order Functionstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputHelen studies functional programming and she is fascinated with a concept ofhigher order functions— functions that are taking other functions as parameters. She decides to generalize the concept of the functionorderand to test it on some examples.For her study, she defines a simple grammar of types. In her grammar, a type non-terminal $$$T$$$ is defined as one of the following grammar productions, together with $$$\\\\textrm{order}(T)$$$, defining an order of the corresponding type:\"()\" is a unit type, $$$\\\\textrm{order}(\\\\textrm{\"}\\\\texttt{()}\\\\textrm{\"}) = 0$$$.\"(\" $$$T$$$ \")\" is a parenthesized type, $$$\\\\textrm{order}(\\\\textrm{\"}\\\\texttt{(}\\\\textrm{\"}\\\\,T\\\\,\\\\textrm{\"}\\\\texttt{)}\\\\textrm{\"}) = \\\\textrm{order}(T)$$$.$$$T_1$$$ \"->\" $$$T_2$$$ is a functional type, $$$\\\\textrm{order}(T_1\\\\,\\\\textrm{\"}\\\\texttt{->}\\\\textrm{\"}\\\\,T_2) = max(\\\\textrm{order}(T_1) + 1, \\\\textrm{order}(T_2))$$$. The function constructor $$$T_1$$$ \"->\" $$$T_2$$$ is right-to-left associative, so the type \"()->()->()\" is the same as the type \"()->(()->())\" of a function returning a function, and it has an order of $$$1$$$. While \"(()->())->()\" is a function that has an order-1 type \"(()->())\" as a parameter, and it has an order of $$$2$$$.Helen asks for your help in writing a program that computes an order of the given type.InputThe single line of the input contains a string consisting of characters '(', ')', '-', and '>' that describes a type that is valid according to the grammar from the problem statement. The length of the line is at most $$$10^4$$$ characters.OutputPrint a single integer — the order of the given type.ExamplesInput()Output0Input()->()Output1Input()->()->()Output1Input(()->())->()Output2Input()->(((()->())->()->())->())Output3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c72a2471", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given a string representing a type, determine its order according to the following rules:\n\n*  A type enclosed in parentheses `()` has an order of 0.\n*  A type `T1 -> T2` (function type) has an order equal to the maximum of `order(T1) + 1` and `order(T2)`.\n\nThe function type is right-to-left associative.\n\n**Input:** A string representing a type.\n\n**Output:** An integer representing the order of the type."}, {"prompt_md5": "d020f2ef", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a string representing a type, determine its order based on the following rules:\n\n* Parentheses enclose a type, and the order is the same as the enclosed type.\n* \"->\" means a function.
