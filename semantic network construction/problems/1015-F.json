Bracket Substringtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a bracket sequence $$$s$$$ (not necessarily a regular one). A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters '(' and ')'.A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '1' and '+' between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences \"()()\" and \"(())\" are regular (the resulting expressions are: \"(1)+(1)\" and \"((1+1)+1)\"), and \")(\", \"(\" and \")\" are not.Your problem is to calculate the number of regular bracket sequences of length $$$2n$$$ containing the given bracket sequence $$$s$$$ as a substring (consecutive sequence of characters) modulo $$$10^9+7$$$ ($$$1000000007$$$).InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the half-length of the resulting regular bracket sequences (the resulting sequences must have length equal to $$$2n$$$).The second line of the input contains one string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 200$$$) — the string $$$s$$$ that should be a substring in each of the resulting regular bracket sequences ($$$|s|$$$ is the length of $$$s$$$).OutputPrint only one integer — the number of regular bracket sequences containing the given bracket sequence $$$s$$$ as a substring.
