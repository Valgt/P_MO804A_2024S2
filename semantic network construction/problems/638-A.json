The houses are located at both sides of the street. The houses with odd numbers are at one side of the street and are numbered from1ton- 1in the order from the beginning of the street to the end (in the picture: from left to right). The houses with even numbers are at the other side of the street and are numbered from2tonin the order from the end of the street to its beginning (in the picture: from right to left). The corresponding houses with even and odd numbers are strictly opposite each other, that is, house1is opposite housen, house3is opposite housen- 2, house5is opposite housen- 4and so on.Vasya needs to get to house numberaas quickly as possible. He starts driving from the beginning of the street and drives his car to housea. To get from the beginning of the street to houses number1andn, he spends exactly1second. He also spends exactly one second to drive the distance between two neighbouring houses. Vasya can park at any side of the road, so the distance between the beginning of the street at the houses that stand opposite one another should be considered the same.Your task is: find the minimum time Vasya needs to reach housea.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers,nanda(1 ≤a≤n≤ 100 000) — the number of houses on the street and the number of the house that Vasya needs to reach, correspondingly. It is guaranteed that numbernis even.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum time Vasya needs to get from the beginning of the street to housea.ExamplesInput4 2Output2Input8 5Output3NoteIn the first sample there are only four houses on the street, two houses at each side.
