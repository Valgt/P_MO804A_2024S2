Parquettime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutOnce Bob decided to lay a parquet floor in his living room. The living room is of sizen×mmetres. Bob had planks of three types:aplanks1 × 2meters,bplanks2 × 1meters, andcplanks2 × 2meters. Help Bob find out, if it is possible to parquet the living room with such a set of planks, and if it is possible, find one of the possible ways to do so. Bob doesn't have to use all the planks.InputThe first input line contains 5 space-separated integer numbersn,m,a,b,c(1 ≤n,m≤ 100, 0 ≤a,b,c≤ 104),nandm— the living room dimensions,a,bandc— amount of planks1 × 2,2 × 1и2 × 2respectively. It's not allowed to turn the planks.OutputIf it is not possible to parquet the room with such a set of planks, outputIMPOSSIBLE. Otherwise output one of the possible ways to parquet the room — outputnlines withmlower-case Latin letters each. Two squares with common sides should contain the same letters, if they belong to one and the same plank, and different letters otherwise. Different planks can be marked with one and the same letter (see examples). If the answer is not unique, output any.ExamplesInput2 6 2 2 1OutputaabccaaabddaInput1 1 100 100 100OutputIMPOSSIBLEInput4 4 10 10 10Outputaabbaabbbbaabbaa", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "db846c6b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given the dimensions of a rectangular room ($n \\times m$ meters).
