Levko and Permutationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutLevko loves permutations very much. A permutation of lengthnis a sequence of distinct positive integers, each is at mostn.Let’s assume that valuegcd(a,b)shows the greatest common divisor of numbersaandb. Levko assumes that elementpiof permutationp1,p2, ... ,pnis good ifgcd(i,pi) > 1. Levko considers a permutationbeautiful, if it has exactlykgood elements. Unfortunately, he doesn’t know any beautiful permutation. Your task is to help him to find at least one of them.InputThe single line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 105,0 ≤k≤n).OutputIn a single line print either any beautiful permutation or -1, if such permutation doesn’t exist.If there are multiple suitable permutations, you are allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput4 2Output2 4 3 1Input1 1Output-1NoteIn the first sample elements4and3are good becausegcd(2, 4) = 2 > 1andgcd(3, 3) = 3 > 1. Elements2and1are not good becausegcd(1, 2) = 1andgcd(4, 1) = 1. As there are exactly 2 good elements, the permutation is beautiful.The second sample has no beautiful permutations.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8771edc1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers $n$ and $k$.
