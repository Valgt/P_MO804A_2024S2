Unique Stringstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's say that two strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ areequalif you can get the string $$$b$$$ by cyclically shifting string $$$a$$$. For example, the strings0100110and1100100are equal, while1010and1100are not.You are given a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Its first $$$c$$$ characters are1-s, and its last $$$n - c$$$ characters are0-s.In one operation, you can replace one0with1.Calculate the number of unique strings you can get using no more than $$$k$$$ operations. Since the answer may be too large, print it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.InputThe first and only line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$c$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 3000$$$; $$$1 \\\\le c \\\\le n$$$; $$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le n - c$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$, the length of prefix of1-s and the maximum number of operations.OutputPrint the single integer — the number ofuniquestrings you can achieve performing no more than $$$k$$$ operations, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExamplesInput1 1 0Output1Input3 1 2Output3Input5 1 1Output3Input6 2 2Output7Input24 3 11Output498062NoteIn the first test case, the only possible string is1.In the second test case, the possible strings are:100,110, and111. String101is equal to110, so we don't count it.In the third test case, the possible strings are:10000,11000,10100.
