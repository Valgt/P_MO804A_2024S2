Fly, freebies, fly!time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutEveryone loves a freebie. Especially students.It is well-known that if in the night before exam a student opens window, opens the student's record-book and shouts loudly three times \"Fly, freebie, fly!\" — then flown freebie helps him to pass the upcoming exam.In the night before the exam on mathematical analysisnstudents living in dormitory shouted treasured words. Thei-th student made a sacrament at the timeti, wheretiis the number of seconds elapsed since the beginning of the night.It is known that the freebie is a capricious and willful lady. That night the freebie was near dormitory only forTseconds. Therefore, if for two students their sacrament times differ for more thanT, then the freebie didn't visit at least one of them.Since all students are optimists, they really want to know what is the maximal number of students visited by the freebie can be.InputThe first line of the input contains integern(1 ≤n≤ 100), wheren— the number of students shouted \"Fly, freebie, fly!\" The second line containsnpositive integersti(1 ≤ti≤ 1000).The last line contains integerT(1 ≤T≤ 1000) — the time interval during which the freebie was near the dormitory.OutputPrint a single integer — the largest number of people who will pass exam tomorrow because of the freebie visit.ExamplesInput64 1 7 8 3 81Output3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "3bb97c66", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of $n$ times ($t_i$) representing when $n$ students shouted a phrase.
