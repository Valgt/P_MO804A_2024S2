The goal is to replace each question mark with some positive integer from1ton, such that equality holds.InputThe only line of the input contains a rebus. It's guaranteed that it contains no more than100question marks, integernis positive and doesn't exceed1 000 000, all letters and integers are separated by spaces, arithmetic operations are located only between question marks.OutputThe first line of the output should contain \"Possible\" (without quotes) if rebus has a solution and \"Impossible\" (without quotes) otherwise.If the answer exists, the second line should contain any valid rebus with question marks replaced by integers from1ton.
