Segments Removaltime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya has an array of integers of lengthn.Vasya performs the following operations on the array: on each step he finds the longest segment of consecutive equal integers (the leftmost, if there are several such segments) and removes it. For example, if Vasya's array is[13, 13, 7, 7, 7, 2, 2, 2], then after one operation it becomes[13, 13, 2, 2, 2].Compute the number of operations Vasya should make until the array becomes empty, i.e. Vasya removes all elements from it.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 200 000) — the length of the array.The second line contains a sequencea1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) — Vasya's array.OutputPrint the number of operations Vasya should make to remove all elements from the array.ExamplesInput42 5 5 2Output2Input56 3 4 1 5Output5Input84 4 4 2 2 100 100 100Output3Input610 10 50 10 50 50Output4NoteIn the first example, at first Vasya removes two fives at the second and third positions. The array becomes[2, 2]. In the second operation Vasya removes two twos at the first and second positions. After that the array becomes empty.In the second example Vasya has to perform five operations to make the array empty. In each of them he removes the first element from the array.In the third example Vasya needs three operations. In the first operation he removes all integers4, in the second — all integers100, in the third — all integers2.In the fourth example in the first operation Vasya removes the first two integers10. After that the array becomes[50, 10, 50, 50]. Then in the second operation Vasya removes the two rightmost integers50, so that the array becomes[50, 10]. In the third operation he removes the remaining50, and the array becomes[10]after that. In the last, fourth operation he removes the only remaining10. The array is empty after that.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5ace4b64", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers.
