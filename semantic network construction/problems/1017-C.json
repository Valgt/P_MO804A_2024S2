The Phone Numbertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMrs. Smith is trying to contact her husband, John Smith, but she forgot the secret phone number!The only thing Mrs. Smith remembered was that any permutation of $$$n$$$ can be a secret phone number. Only those permutations that minimize secret value might be the phone of her husband.The sequence of $$$n$$$ integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once.The secret value of a phone number is defined as the sum of the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and length of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS).A subsequence $$$a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\\\ldots, a_{i_k}$$$ where $$$1\\\\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\\\ldots < i_k\\\\leq n$$$ is called increasing if $$$a_{i_1} < a_{i_2} < a_{i_3} < \\\\ldots < a_{i_k}$$$. If $$$a_{i_1} > a_{i_2} > a_{i_3} > \\\\ldots > a_{i_k}$$$, a subsequence is called decreasing. An increasing/decreasing subsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all increasing/decreasing subsequences.For example, if there is a permutation $$$[6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 3, 5]$$$,LISof this permutation will be $$$[1, 2, 3, 5]$$$, so the length ofLISis equal to $$$4$$$.LDScan be $$$[6, 4, 1]$$$, $$$[6, 4, 2]$$$, or $$$[6, 4, 3]$$$, so the length ofLDSis $$$3$$$.Note, the lengths ofLISandLDScan be different.So please help Mrs. Smith to find a permutation that gives a minimum sum of lengths ofLISandLDS.InputThe only line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of permutation that you need to build.OutputPrint a permutation that gives a minimum sum of lengths ofLISandLDS.If there are multiple answers, print any.ExamplesInput4Output3 4 1 2Input2Output2 1NoteIn the first sample, you can build a permutation $$$[3, 4, 1, 2]$$$.LISis $$$[3, 4]$$$ (or $$$[1, 2]$$$), so the length ofLISis equal to $$$2$$$.LDScan be ony of $$$[3, 1]$$$, $$$[4, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 2]$$$, or $$$[4, 1]$$$. The length ofLDSis also equal to $$$2$$$. The sum is equal to $$$4$$$. Note that $$$[3, 4, 1, 2]$$$ isnotthe only permutation that is valid.In the second sample, you can build a permutation $$$[2, 1]$$$.LISis $$$[1]$$$ (or $$$[2]$$$), so the length ofLISis equal to $$$1$$$.LDSis $$$[2, 1]$$$, so the length ofLDSis equal to $$$2$$$. The sum is equal to $$$3$$$.
