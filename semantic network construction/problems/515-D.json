Drazil and Tilestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutDrazil created a following problem about putting1 × 2tiles into ann×mgrid:\"There is a grid with some cells that are empty and some cells that are occupied. You should use1 × 2tiles to cover all empty cells and no two tiles should cover each other. And you should print a solution about how to do it.\"But Drazil doesn't like to write special checking program for this task. His friend, Varda advised him: \"how about asking contestant only to print the solutionwhen it exists and it is unique? Otherwise contestant may print 'Not unique' \".Drazil found that the constraints for this task may be much larger than for the original task!Can you solve this new problem?Note that you should print 'Not unique' either when there exists no solution or when there exists several different solutions for the original task.InputThe first line contains two integersnandm(1 ≤n,m≤ 2000).The followingnlines describe the grid rows. Character '.' denotes an empty cell, and the character '*' denotes a cell that is occupied.OutputIf there is no solution or the solution is not unique, you should print the string \"Not unique\".Otherwise you should print how to cover all empty cells with1 × 2tiles. Use characters \"<>\" to denote horizontal tiles and characters \"^v\" to denote vertical tiles. Refer to the sample test for the output format example.ExamplesInput3 3....*....OutputNot uniqueInput4 4..***...*.**....Output<>***^<>*v**<><>Input2 4*..*....Output*<>*<><>Input1 1.OutputNot uniqueInput1 1*Output*NoteIn the first case, there are indeed two solutions:<>^^*vv<>and^<>v*^<>vso the answer is \"Not unique\".", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "4cd162fa", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a grid of size $n \\times m$ where '.' represents an empty cell and '*' represents a filled cell.
