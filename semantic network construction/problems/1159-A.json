A pile of stonestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $$$n$$$ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.You are given $$$n$$$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.InputThe first line contains one positive integer $$$n$$$ — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 100$$$).The next line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ symbols, equal to \"-\" (without quotes) or \"+\" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $$$i$$$-th operation, $$$s_i$$$ is equal to \"-\" (without quotes), if added, $$$s_i$$$ is equal to \"+\" (without quotes).OutputPrint one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $$$n$$$ operations.ExamplesInput3 ---Output0Input4 ++++Output4Input2 -+Output1Input5 ++-++Output3NoteIn the first test, if Vasya had $$$3$$$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $$$0$$$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $$$0$$$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $$$3$$$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).In the second test, if Vasya had $$$0$$$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $$$4$$$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $$$4$$$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $$$4$$$ stones. So, the answer is $$$4$$$.In the third test, if Vasya had $$$1$$$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $$$1$$$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.In the fourth test, if Vasya had $$$0$$$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $$$3$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7074c946", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of operations, where each operation is either adding a stone to a pile or removing a stone from the pile.
