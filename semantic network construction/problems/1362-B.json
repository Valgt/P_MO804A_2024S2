Johnny and His Hobbiestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAmong Johnny's numerous hobbies, there are two seemingly harmless ones: applying bitwise operations and sneaking into his dad's office. As it is usually the case with small children, Johnny is unaware that combining these two activities can get him in a lot of trouble.There is a set $$$S$$$ containing very important numbers on his dad's desk. The minute Johnny heard about it, he decided that it's a good idea to choose apositiveinteger $$$k$$$ and replace each element $$$s$$$ of the set $$$S$$$ with $$$s \\\\oplus k$$$ ($$$\\\\oplus$$$ denotes theexclusive oroperation).Help him choose such $$$k$$$ that Johnny's dad will not see any difference after his son is done playing (i.e. Johnny will get the same set as before playing). It is possible that no such number exists. It is also possible that there are many of them. In such a case, output the smallest one. Note that the order of elements in a set doesn't matter, i.e. set $$$\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}$$$ equals to set $$$\\\\{2, 1, 3\\\\}$$$.Formally, find the smallest positive integer $$$k$$$ such that $$$\\\\{s \\\\oplus k | s \\\\in S\\\\} = S$$$ or report that there is no such number.For example, if $$$S = \\\\{1, 3, 4\\\\}$$$ and $$$k = 2$$$, new set will be equal to $$$\\\\{3, 1, 6\\\\}$$$. If $$$S = \\\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\\\}$$$ and $$$k = 1$$$, after playing set will stay the same.InputIn the first line of input, there is a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1024$$$), the number of test cases. In the next lines, $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each of them consists of two lines.In the first line there is a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1024$$$) denoting the number of elements in set $$$S$$$. Second line consists of $$$n$$$distinctintegers $$$s_i$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq s_i < 1024$$$), elements of $$$S$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$1024$$$.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines; $$$i$$$-th line should contain the answer to the $$$i$$$-th test case, the minimal positive integer $$$k$$$ satisfying the conditions or $$$-1$$$ if no such $$$k$$$ exists.ExampleInput6 4 1 0 2 3 6 10 7 14 8 3 12 2 0 2 3 1 2 3 6 1 4 6 10 11 12 2 0 1023Output1 4 2 -1 -1 1023NoteIn the first test case, the answer is $$$1$$$ because it is a minimum positive integer and it satisfies all the conditions.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5e7ad809", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a set of integers $S$.
