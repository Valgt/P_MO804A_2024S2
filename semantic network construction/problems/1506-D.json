Epic Transformationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of integers. You can apply the following operation, consisting of several steps, on the array $$$a$$$zeroor more times:you select twodifferentnumbers in the array $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$;you remove $$$i$$$-th and $$$j$$$-th elements from the array.For example, if $$$n=6$$$ and $$$a=[1, 6, 1, 1, 4, 4]$$$, then you can perform the following sequence of operations:select $$$i=1, j=5$$$. The array $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$[6, 1, 1, 4]$$$;select $$$i=1, j=2$$$. The array $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$[1, 4]$$$.What can be the minimum size of the array after applying some sequence of operations to it?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) is length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum possible size of the array after applying some sequence of operations to it.ExampleInput5 6 1 6 1 1 4 4 2 1 2 2 1 1 5 4 5 4 5 4 6 2 3 2 1 3 1Output0 0 2 1 0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f0f78d12", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a list of numbers.
