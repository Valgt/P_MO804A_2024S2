Remainder Problemtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$500000$$$ integers (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$500000$$$). Initially all elements of $$$a$$$ are zero.You have to process two types of queries to this array:$$$1$$$ $$$x$$$ $$$y$$$ — increase $$$a_x$$$ by $$$y$$$;$$$2$$$ $$$x$$$ $$$y$$$ — compute $$$\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i \\\\in R(x, y)} a_i$$$, where $$$R(x, y)$$$ is the set of all integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$500000$$$ which have remainder $$$y$$$ modulo $$$x$$$.Can you process all the queries?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 500000$$$) — the number of queries.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, each describing a query. The $$$i$$$-th line contains three integers $$$t_i$$$, $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t_i \\\\le 2$$$). If $$$t_i = 1$$$, then it is a query of the first type, $$$1 \\\\le x_i \\\\le 500000$$$, and $$$-1000 \\\\le y_i \\\\le 1000$$$. If $$$t_i = 2$$$, then it it a query of the second type, $$$1 \\\\le x_i \\\\le 500000$$$, and $$$0 \\\\le y_i < x_i$$$.It is guaranteed that there will be at least one query of type $$$2$$$.OutputFor each query of type $$$2$$$ print one integer — the answer to it.ExampleInput5 1 3 4 2 3 0 2 4 3 1 4 -4 2 1 0Output4 4 0", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5ed93146", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You have an array of 500,000 numbers.
