Code For 1time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputJon fought bravely to rescue the wildlings who were attacked by the white-walkers at Hardhome. On his arrival, Sam tells him that he wants to go to Oldtown to train at the Citadel to become a maester, so he can return and take the deceased Aemon's place as maester of Castle Black. Jon agrees to Sam's proposal and Sam sets off his journey to the Citadel. However becoming a trainee at the Citadel is not a cakewalk and hence the maesters at the Citadel gave Sam a problem to test his eligibility.Initially Sam has a list with a single elementn. Then he has to perform certain operations on this list. In each operation Sam must remove any elementx, such thatx> 1, from the list and insert at the same position,,sequentially. He must continue with these operations until all the elements in the list are either0or1.Now the masters want the total number of1s in the rangeltor(1-indexed). Sam wants to become a maester but unfortunately he cannot solve this problem. Can you help Sam to pass the eligibility test?InputThe first line contains three integersn,l,r(0 ≤n< 250,0 ≤r-l≤ 105,r≥ 1,l≥ 1) – initial element and the rangeltor.It is guaranteed thatris not greater than the length of the final list.OutputOutput the total number of1s in the rangeltorin the final sequence.ExamplesInput7 2 5Output4Input10 3 10Output5NoteConsider first example:Elements on positions from2-nd to5-th in list is[1, 1, 1, 1].
