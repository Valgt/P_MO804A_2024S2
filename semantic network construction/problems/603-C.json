Lieges of Legendretime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKevin and Nicky Sun have invented a new game called Lieges of Legendre. In this game, two players take turns modifying the game state with Kevin moving first. Initially, the game is set up so that there arenpiles of cows, with thei-th pile containingaicows. During each player's turn, that player calls upon the power of Sunlight, and uses it to either:Remove a single cow from a chosen non-empty pile.Choose a pile of cows with even size2·x(x> 0), and replace it withkpiles ofxcows each.The player who removes the last cow wins. Givenn,k, and a sequencea1,a2, ...,an, help Kevin and Nicky find the winner, given that both sides play in optimal way.InputThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 100 000, 1 ≤k≤ 109).The second line containsnintegers,a1,a2, ...an(1 ≤ai≤ 109) describing the initial state of the game.OutputOutput the name of the winning player, either \"Kevin\" or \"Nicky\" (without quotes).ExamplesInput2 13 4OutputKevinInput1 23OutputNickyNoteIn the second sample, Nicky can win in the following way: Kevin moves first and is forced to remove a cow, so the pile contains two cows after his move. Next, Nicky replaces this pile of size 2 with two piles of size 1. So the game state is now two piles of size 1. Kevin then removes one of the remaining cows and Nicky wins by removing the other.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "73e21509", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Two players take turns modifying a set of piles of objects.
