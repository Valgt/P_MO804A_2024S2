Food Buyingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has $$$s$$$ burles on his card.Mishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose somepositive integer number$$$1 \\\\le x \\\\le s$$$, buy food that costs exactly $$$x$$$ burles and obtain $$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{x}{10}\\\\rfloor$$$ burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends $$$x$$$ burles and obtains $$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{x}{10}\\\\rfloor$$$ back). The operation $$$\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{a}{b}\\\\rfloor$$$ means $$$a$$$ divided by $$$b$$$ rounded down.It is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs $$$x$$$ for any possible value of $$$x$$$.Your task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.For example, if Mishka has $$$s=19$$$ burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is $$$21$$$. Firstly, he can spend $$$x=10$$$ burles, obtain $$$1$$$ burle as a cashback. Now he has $$$s=10$$$ burles, so can spend $$$x=10$$$ burles, obtain $$$1$$$ burle as a cashback and spend it too.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a separate line and consists of one integer $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le s \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the number of burles Mishka initially has.OutputFor each test case print the answer on it — the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.ExampleInput6 1 10 19 9876 12345 1000000000Output1 11 21 10973 13716 1111111111", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "dbe00ddd", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a number $s$.
