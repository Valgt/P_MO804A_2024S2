Koala and Lightstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt is a holiday season, and Koala is decorating his house with cool lights! He owns $$$n$$$ lights, all of which flash periodically.After taking a quick glance at them, Koala realizes that each of his lights can be described with two parameters $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. Light with parameters $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ will toggle (on to off, or off to on) every $$$a_i$$$ seconds starting from the $$$b_i$$$-th second. In other words, it will toggle at the moments $$$b_i$$$, $$$b_i + a_i$$$, $$$b_i + 2 \\\\cdot a_i$$$ and so on.You know for each light whether it's initially on or off and its corresponding parameters $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. Koala is wondering what is the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time. So you need to find that out.Here is a graphic for the first example.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$), the number of lights.The next line contains a string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters. The $$$i$$$-th character is \"1\", if the $$$i$$$-th lamp is initially on. Otherwise, $$$i$$$-th character is \"0\".The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i, b_i \\\\le 5$$$)  — the parameters of the $$$i$$$-th light.OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time.ExamplesInput3 101 3 3 3 2 3 1Output2Input4 1111 3 4 5 2 3 1 3 2Output4Input6 011100 5 3 5 5 2 4 3 5 4 2 1 5Output6NoteFor first example, the lamps' states are shown in the picture above. The largest number of simultaneously on lamps is $$$2$$$ (e.g. at the moment $$$2$$$).In the second example, all lights are initially on. So the answer is $$$4$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "198b6200", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ lights.
