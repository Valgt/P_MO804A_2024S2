Extra-terrestrial Intelligencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test64 megabytesinputinput.txtoutputoutput.txtRecently Vasya got interested in finding extra-terrestrial intelligence. He made a simple extra-terrestrial signals’ receiver and was keeping a record of the signals forndays in a row. Each of thosendays Vasya wrote a 1 in his notebook if he had received a signal that day and a 0 if he hadn’t. Vasya thinks that he has found extra-terrestrial intelligence if there is a system in the way the signals has been received, i.e. if all the intervals between successive signals are equal. Otherwise, Vasya thinks that the signals were sent by some stupid aliens no one cares about. Help Vasya to deduce from the information given by the receiver if he has found extra-terrestrial intelligence or not.InputThe first line contains integern(3 ≤n≤ 100) — amount of days during which Vasya checked if there were any signals. The second line containsncharacters 1 or 0 — the record Vasya kept each of thosendays. It’s guaranteed that the given record sequence contains at least three 1s.OutputIf Vasya has found extra-terrestrial intelligence, outputYES, otherwise outputNO.ExamplesInput800111000OutputYESInput71001011OutputNOInput71010100OutputYES", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "74035092", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 100$) numbers, where each number is either 1 or 0.
