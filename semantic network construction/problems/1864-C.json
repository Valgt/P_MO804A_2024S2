Divisor Chaintime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer $$$x$$$. Your task is to reduce $$$x$$$ to $$$1$$$.To do that, you can do the following operation:select a divisor $$$d$$$ of $$$x$$$, then change $$$x$$$ to $$$x-d$$$, i.e. reduce $$$x$$$ by $$$d$$$. (We say that $$$d$$$ is a divisor of $$$x$$$ if $$$d$$$ is an positive integer and there exists an integer $$$q$$$ such that $$$x = d \\\\cdot q$$$.)There is an additional constraint: youcannotselect the same value of $$$d$$$more than twice.For example, for $$$x=5$$$, the following scheme isinvalidbecause $$$1$$$ is selected more than twice: $$$5\\\\xrightarrow{-1}4\\\\xrightarrow{-1}3\\\\xrightarrow{-1}2\\\\xrightarrow{-1}1$$$. The following scheme is however a valid one: $$$5\\\\xrightarrow{-1}4\\\\xrightarrow{-2}2\\\\xrightarrow{-1}1$$$.Output any scheme which reduces $$$x$$$ to $$$1$$$ with at most $$$1000$$$ operations. It can be proved that such a scheme always exists.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$2\\\\le x \\\\le 10^{9}$$$).OutputFor each test case, output two lines.The first line should contain an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 1001$$$).The next line should contain $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_k$$$, which satisfy the following:$$$a_1=x$$$;$$$a_k=1$$$;for each $$$2 \\\\le i \\\\le k$$$, the value $$$(a_{i-1}-a_i)$$$ is a divisor of $$$a_{i-1}$$$.
