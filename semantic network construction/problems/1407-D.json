Discrete Centrifugal Jumpstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ beautiful skyscrapers in New York, the height of the $$$i$$$-th one is $$$h_i$$$. Today some villains have set on fire first $$$n - 1$$$ of them, and now the only safety building is $$$n$$$-th skyscraper.Let's call a jump from $$$i$$$-th skyscraper to $$$j$$$-th ($$$i < j$$$)discrete, if all skyscrapers between are strictly lower or higher than both of them. Formally, jump is discrete, if $$$i < j$$$ and one of the following conditions satisfied:$$$i + 1 = j$$$$$$\\\\max(h_{i + 1}, \\\\ldots, h_{j - 1}) < \\\\min(h_i, h_j)$$$$$$\\\\max(h_i, h_j) < \\\\min(h_{i + 1}, \\\\ldots, h_{j - 1})$$$.At the moment, Vasya is staying on the first skyscraper and wants to live a little longer, so his goal is to reach $$$n$$$-th skyscraper with minimal count of discrete jumps. Help him with calcualting this number.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — total amount of skyscrapers.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\\\ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le h_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — heights of skyscrapers.OutputPrint single number $$$k$$$ — minimal amount of discrete jumps. We can show that an answer always exists.ExamplesInput5 1 3 1 4 5Output3Input4 4 2 2 4Output1Input2 1 1Output1Input5 100 1 100 1 100Output2NoteIn the first testcase, Vasya can jump in the following way: $$$1 \\\\rightarrow 2 \\\\rightarrow 4 \\\\rightarrow 5$$$.In the second and third testcases, we can reach last skyscraper in one jump.Sequence of jumps in the fourth testcase: $$$1 \\\\rightarrow 3 \\\\rightarrow 5$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8283851f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ integers, $h_1, h_2, ..., h_n$, representing the heights of $n$ buildings.
