The subproblems have different constraints on the input. You will get some score for the correct submission of the subproblem. The description of the subproblems follows.In subproblem B1 (3points), the constraint1 ≤n≤ 8will hold.In subproblem B2 (4points), the constraint1 ≤n≤ 50will hold.OutputOutputnnumber forming the required permutation.ExamplesInput2 2Output2 1Input3 2Output1 3 2NoteIn the first example, both permutations of numbers {1, 2} yield maximum possiblef(p)which is equal to 4.
