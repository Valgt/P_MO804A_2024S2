Broken Clocktime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a broken clock. You know, that it is supposed to show time in 12- or 24-hoursHH:MMformat. In 12-hours format hours change from1to12, while in 24-hours it changes from0to23. In both formats minutes change from0to59.You are given a time in formatHH:MMthat is currently displayed on the broken clock. Your goal is to change minimum number of digits in order to make clocks display the correct time in the given format.For example, if00:99is displayed, it is enough to replace the second9with3in order to get00:39that is a correct time in 24-hours format. However, to make00:99correct in 12-hours format, one has to change at least two digits. Additionally to the first change one can replace the second0with1and obtain01:39.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer12or24, that denote 12-hours or 24-hours format respectively.The second line contains the time in formatHH:MM, that is currently displayed on the clock. First two characters stand for the hours, while next two show the minutes.OutputThe only line of the output should contain the time in formatHH:MMthat is a correct time in the given format. It should differ from the original in as few positions as possible. If there are many optimal solutions you can print any of them.ExamplesInput2417:30Output17:30Input1217:30Output07:30Input2499:99Output09:09", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "36a818bc", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a broken clock that displays time in either 12-hour or 24-hour format (HH:MM).
