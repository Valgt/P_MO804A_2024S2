Joyboardtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputChaneka, a gamer kid, invented a new gaming controller called joyboard. Interestingly, the joyboard she invented can only be used to play one game.The joyboard has a screen containing $$$n+1$$$ slots numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n+1$$$ from left to right. The $$$n+1$$$ slots are going to be filled with an array of non-negative integers $$$[a_1,a_2,a_3,\\\\ldots,a_{n+1}]$$$. Chaneka, as the player, must assign $$$a_{n+1}$$$ with an integer between $$$0$$$ and $$$m$$$ inclusive. Then, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$n$$$ to $$$1$$$, the value of $$$a_i$$$ will be equal to theremainderof dividing $$$a_{i+1}$$$ (the adjacent value to the right) by $$$i$$$. In other words, $$$a_i = a_{i + 1} \\\\bmod i$$$.Chaneka wants it such that after every slot is assigned with an integer, there are exactly $$$k$$$ distinct values in the entire screen (among all $$$n+1$$$ slots). How many valid ways are there for assigning a non-negative integer into slot $$$n+1$$$?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 2\\\\cdot10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^9$$$; $$$0 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 10^9$$$; $$$1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n+1$$$) — there are $$$n+1$$$ slots, the integer assigned in slot $$$n+1$$$ must not be bigger than $$$m$$$, and there should be exactly $$$k$$$ distinct values.OutputFor each test case, output a line containing an integer representing the number of valid ways for assigning a non-negative integer into slot $$$n+1$$$.ExampleInput44 6 32 0 1265 265 2653 10 2Output2 1 0 5NoteIn the first test case, one of the $$$2$$$ possible ways for Chaneka is to choose $$$a_{n+1}=6$$$. If she does that, then:$$$a_4=a_5\\\\bmod 4=6\\\\bmod 4=2$$$$$$a_3=a_4\\\\bmod 3=2\\\\bmod 3=2$$$$$$a_2=a_3\\\\bmod 2=2\\\\bmod 2=0$$$$$$a_1=a_2\\\\bmod 1=0\\\\bmod 1=0$$$$$$a = [0, 0, 2, 2, 6]$$$There are $$$3$$$ distinct values.In the second test case, the $$$1$$$ possible way for Chaneka is to choose $$$a_{n+1}=0$$$. If she does that, then $$$a = [0, 0, 0]$$$. There is only $$$1$$$ distinct value.In the third test case, there is no possible way for assigning a non-negative integer into slot $$$n+1$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a9964854", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n+1$ slots, numbered from 1 to $n+1$.
