MEXanized Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three non-negative integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$x$$$. Find the maximum possible sum of elements in an array consisting of non-negative integers, which has $$$n$$$ elements, its MEX is equal to $$$k$$$, and all its elements do not exceed $$$x$$$. If such an array does not exist, output $$$-1$$$.The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:The MEX of $$$[2,2,1]$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the array.The MEX of $$$[3,1,0,1]$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the array, but $$$2$$$ does not.The MEX of $$$[0,3,1,2]$$$ is $$$4$$$, because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ belong to the array, but $$$4$$$ does not.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n, k, x \\\\leq 200$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a single number — the maximum sum of elements in a valid array, or $$$-1$$$, if such an array does not exist.ExampleInput95 3 34 7 54 2 2812 10 657 51 122200 1 2002 2 13 2 14 7 10Output7 -1 57 -1 2007 39800 1 2 -1NoteIn the first test case, the maximum sum is $$$7$$$, and one of the valid arrays is $$$[0, 1, 2, 2, 2]$$$.In the second test case, there are no valid arrays of length $$$n$$$.In the third test case, the maximum sum is $$$57$$$, and one of the valid arrays is $$$[0, 1, 28, 28]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1a4f4c0a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given three numbers: $n$, $k$, and $x$.
