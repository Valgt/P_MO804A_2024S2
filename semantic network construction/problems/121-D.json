Lucky Segmentstime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutPetya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits4and7. For example, numbers47,744,4are lucky and5,17,467are not.Petya hasnnumber segments[l1;r1],[l2;r2], ...,[ln;rn]. During one move Petya can take any segment (let it be segment numberi) and replace it with segment[li+ 1;ri+ 1]or[li- 1;ri- 1]. In other words, during one move Petya can shift any segment to the left or to the right by a unit distance. Petya calls a numberfullif it belongs to each segment. That is, numberxis full if for anyi(1 ≤i≤n)the conditionli≤x≤riis fulfilled.Petya makes no more thankmoves. After that he counts the quantity of full lucky numbers. Find the maximal quantity that he can get.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 105,1 ≤k≤ 1018)— the number of segments and the maximum number of moves. Nextnlines contain pairs of integersliandri(1 ≤li≤ri≤ 1018).Please do not use the%lldspecificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the%I64dspecificator.OutputPrint on the single line the single number — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput4 71 46 94 73 5Output1Input2 740 4547 74Output2NoteIn the first sample Petya shifts the second segment by two units to the left (it turns into[4; 7]), after that number4becomes full.In the second sample Petya shifts the first segment by two units to the right (it turns into[42; 47]), and shifts the second segment by three units to the left (it turns into[44; 71]), after that numbers44and47become full.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2fc0652d", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ segments on a number line, each defined by a starting point $l_i$ and an ending point $r_i$.
