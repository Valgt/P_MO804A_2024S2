Dasha and Photostime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDasha decided to have a rest after solving the problemDand began to look photos from previous competitions.Let's call photos as the matrix with the sizen×m, which consists of lowercase English letters.Somekphotos especially interested her, because they can be received from photo-template by painting a rectangular area in a certain color. Let's call such photos special.More formally thei-th special photo is received from the photo-template by replacing all characters on some rectangle with upper left corner of the cell with coordinates(ai,bi)and lower right corner in the cell with coordinates(ci,di)to the symbolei.Dasha asks you to find the special photo so that the total distance from it to all other special photos is minimum. And calculate this distance.Determine the distance between two photos as the sum of distances between all corresponding letters. The distance between two letters is the difference module of their positions in the alphabet. For example, the distance between letters 'h' and 'm' equals|8 - 13| = 5, because the letter 'h' is the 8-th in the alphabet, the letter 'm' is the 13-th.InputThe first line contains three integersn,m,k(1 ≤n,m≤ 103, 1 ≤k≤ 3·105)— the number of strings in the photo-template, the number of columns and the number of special photos which are interesting for Dasha.The nextnlines contains the string withmlength which consists of little Latin characters — the description of the photo-template.Each of the nextklines contains the description of the special photo in the following format, \"aibicidiei\"(1 ≤ai≤ci≤n, 1 ≤bi≤di≤m), where(ai,bi)— is the coordinate of the upper left corner of the rectangle,(ci,di)— is the description of the lower right corner, andei— is the little Latin letter which replaces the photo-template in the described rectangle.OutputIn the only line print the minimum total distance from the found special photo to all other special photos.ExamplesInput3 3 2aaaaaaaaa1 1 2 2 b2 2 3 3 cOutput10Input5 5 3abcdeeabcddeabccdeabbcdea1 1 3 4 f1 2 3 3 e1 3 3 4 iOutput59NoteIn the first example the photos are following:bba    aaabba    accaaa    accThe distance between them is10.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "dd4ece88", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a photo template of size $n \\times m$ consisting of lowercase English letters.
