Two Rival Studentstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are the gym teacher in the school.There are $$$n$$$ students in the row. And there are two rivalling students among them. The first one is in position $$$a$$$, the second in position $$$b$$$. Positions are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right.Since they are rivals, you want to maximize the distance between them. If students are in positions $$$p$$$ and $$$s$$$ respectively, then distance between them is $$$|p - s|$$$.You can do the following operation at most $$$x$$$ times: choose twoadjacent (neighbouring)students and swap them.Calculate the maximum distance between two rivalling students after at most $$$x$$$ swaps.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$, $$$0 \\\\le x \\\\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\\\le a, b \\\\le n$$$, $$$a \\\\neq b$$$) — the number of students in the row, the number of swaps which you can do, and positions of first and second rivaling students respectively.OutputFor each test case print one integer — the maximum distance between two rivaling students which you can obtain.ExampleInput3 5 1 3 2 100 33 100 1 6 0 2 3Output2 99 1NoteIn the first test case you can swap students in positions $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$. And then the distance between the rivals is equal to $$$|4 - 2| = 2$$$.In the second test case you don't have to swap students.In the third test case you can't swap students.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b80e71e9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You have a row of $n$ students.
