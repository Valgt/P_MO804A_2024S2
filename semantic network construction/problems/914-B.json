Conan and Agasa play a Card Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEdogawa Conan got tired of solving cases, and invited his friend, Professor Agasa, over. They decided to play a game of cards. Conan hasncards, and thei-th card has a numberaiwritten on it.They take turns playing, starting with Conan. In each turn, the player chooses a card and removes it. Also, he removes all cards having a number strictly lesser than the number on the chosen card. Formally, if the player chooses thei-th card, he removes that card and removes thej-th card for alljsuch thataj<ai.A player loses if he cannot make a move on his turn, that is, he loses if there are no cards left. Predict the outcome of the game, assuming both players play optimally.InputThe first line contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 105) — the number of cards Conan has.The next line containsnintegersa1,a2, ...,an(1 ≤ai≤ 105), whereaiis the number on thei-th card.OutputIf Conan wins, print \"Conan\" (without quotes), otherwise print \"Agasa\" (without quotes).ExamplesInput34 5 7OutputConanInput21 1OutputAgasaNoteIn the first example, Conan can just choose the card having number7on it and hence remove all the cards. After that, there are no cards left on Agasa's turn.In the second example, no matter which card Conan chooses, there will be one one card left, which Agasa can choose.
