Then do $$$a_i := x$$$ (assign $$$x$$$ to $$$a_i$$$).Then build acompleteundirectedweightedgraph with $$$n$$$ vertices numbered with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, where edge $$$(l, r)$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l < r \\\\le n$$$) has weight $$$\\\\min(a_{l},a_{l+1},\\\\ldots,a_{r})$$$.You have to find the maximum possiblediameterof the resulting graph after performing at most $$$k$$$ operations.Thediameterof a graph is equal to $$$\\\\max\\\\limits_{1 \\\\le u < v \\\\le n}{\\\\operatorname{d}(u, v)}$$$, where $$$\\\\operatorname{d}(u, v)$$$ is the length of the shortest path between vertex $$$u$$$ and vertex $$$v$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$positiveintegers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print one integer — the maximum possible diameter of the graph after performing at most $$$k$$$ operations.ExampleInput63 12 4 13 21 9 843 110 2 63 2179 17 10000000002 15 92 24 2Output4 168 10 1000000000 9 1000000000NoteIn the first test case, one of the optimal arrays is $$$[2,4,5]$$$.The graph built on this array:$$$\\\\operatorname{d}(1, 2) = \\\\operatorname{d}(1, 3) = 2$$$ and $$$\\\\operatorname{d}(2, 3) = 4$$$, so thediameteris equal to $$$\\\\max(2,2,4) = 4$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ab9e63d9", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of $n$ positive integers, $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, and a positive integer $k \\le n$.
