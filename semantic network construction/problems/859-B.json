Lazy Security Guardtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYour security guard friend recently got a new job at a new security company. The company requires him to patrol an area of the city encompassing exactlyNcity blocks, but they let him choose which blocks. That is, your friend must walk the perimeter of a region whose area is exactlyNblocks. Your friend is quite lazy and would like your help to find the shortest possible route that meets the requirements. The city is laid out in a square grid pattern, and is large enough that for the sake of the problem it can be considered infinite.InputInput will consist of a single integerN(1 ≤N≤ 106), the number of city blocks that must be enclosed by the route.OutputPrint the minimum perimeter that can be achieved.ExamplesInput4Output8Input11Output14Input22Output20NoteHere are some possible shapes for the examples:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c8c3f42e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You need to find the shortest possible perimeter of a shape that encloses a given number of blocks.
