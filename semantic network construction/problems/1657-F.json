Words on Treetime limit per test9 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices, and $$$q$$$ triples $$$(x_i, y_i, s_i)$$$, where $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ are integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and $$$s_i$$$ is a stringwith length equal to the number of vertices on the simple path from $$$x_i$$$ to $$$y_i$$$.You want to write a lowercase Latin letter on each vertex in such a way that, for each of $$$q$$$ given triples, at least one of the following conditions holds:if you write out the letters on the vertices on the simple path from $$$x_i$$$ to $$$y_i$$$ in the order they appear on this path, you get the string $$$s_i$$$;if you write out the letters on the vertices on the simple path from $$$y_i$$$ to $$$x_i$$$ in the order they appear on this path, you get the string $$$s_i$$$.Find any possible way to write a letter on each vertex to meet these constraints, or report that it is impossible.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 4 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 4 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of triples, respectively.Then $$$n - 1$$$ lines follow; the $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u_i, v_i \\\\le n$$$; $$$u_i \\\\ne v_i$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th edge. These edges form a tree.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow; the $$$j$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$x_j$$$ and $$$y_j$$$, and a string $$$s_j$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of $$$s_j$$$ is equal to the number of vertices on the simple path between $$$x_j$$$ and $$$y_j$$$.Additional constraint on the input: $$$\\\\sum \\\\limits_{j=1}^{q} |s_j| \\\\le 4 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputIf there is no way to meet the conditions on all triples, printNO. Otherwise, printYESin the first line, and a string of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters in the second line; the $$$i$$$-th character of the string should be the letter you write on the $$$i$$$-th vertex. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput3 2 2 3 2 1 2 1 ab 2 3 bcOutputYES abcInput3 2 2 3 2 1 2 1 ab 2 3 cdOutputNOInput10 10 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 1 10 1 2 ab 1 3 ab 1 4 ab 1 5 ab 1 6 ab 1 7 ab 1 8 ab 1 9 ab 1 10 ab 10 2 abaOutputYES baaaaaaaaaInput10 10 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 1 10 1 2 ab 1 3 ab 1 4 aa 1 5 ab 1 6 ab 1 7 ab 1 8 ab 1 9 ab 1 10 ab 10 2 abaOutputNO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "8f41f95a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a tree with $n$ vertices.
