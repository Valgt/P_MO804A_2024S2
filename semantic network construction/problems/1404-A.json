Balanced Bitstringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA bitstring is a string consisting only of the characters0and1. A bitstring is called $$$k$$$-balancedif every substring of size $$$k$$$ of this bitstring has an equal amount of0and1characters ($$$\\\\frac{k}{2}$$$ of each).You are given an integer $$$k$$$ and a string $$$s$$$ which is composed only of characters0,1, and?. You need to determine whether you can make a $$$k$$$-balanced bitstring by replacing every?characters in $$$s$$$ with either0or1.A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le k \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$k$$$ is even)  — the length of the string and the parameter for a balanced bitstring.The next line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$|s| = n$$$). It is given that $$$s$$$ consists of only0,1, and?.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, printYESif we can replace every?in $$$s$$$ with0or1such that the resulting bitstring is $$$k$$$-balanced, orNOif it is not possible.ExampleInput9 6 4 100110 3 2 1?1 3 2 1?0 4 4 ???? 7 4 1?0??1? 10 10 11??11??11 4 2 1??1 4 4 ?0?0 6 2 ????00OutputYES YES NO YES YES NO NO YES NONoteFor the first test case, the string is already a $$$4$$$-balanced bitstring.For the second test case, the string can be transformed into101.For the fourth test case, the string can be transformed into0110.For the fifth test case, the string can be transformed into1100110.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5a6af24e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a string of characters consisting of '0', '1', and '?'.
