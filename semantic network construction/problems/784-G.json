BF Calculatortime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test64 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn this problem you will write a simple generator of Brainfuck (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) calculators.You are given an arithmetic expression consisting of integers from 0 to 255 and addition/subtraction signs between them. Output a Brainfuck program which, when executed, will print the result of evaluating this expression.We use a fairly standard Brainfuck interpreter for checking the programs:30000 memory cells.memory cells store integers from 0 to 255 with unsigned 8-bit wraparound.console input (,command) is not supported, but it's not needed for this problem.InputThe only line of input data contains the arithmetic expression. The expression will contain between 2 and 10 operands, separated with arithmetic signs plus and/or minus. Each operand will be an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive. The calculations result is guaranteed to be an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive (results of intermediary calculations might be outside of these boundaries).OutputOutput a Brainfuck program which, when executed, will print the result of evaluating this expression. The program must be at most 5000000 characters long (including the non-command characters), and its execution must be complete in at most 50000000 steps.ExamplesInput2+3Output++>+++><[<+>-]<++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.Input9-7Output+++++++++>+++++++><[<->-]<++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.NoteYou can download the source code of the Brainfuck interpreter by the linkhttp://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/784/bf.cpp. We use this code to interpret outputs.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "68f628b4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an arithmetic expression with integers from 0 to 255 and addition/subtraction signs.  \n\nYour task is to write a Brainfuck program that calculates the result of this expression. \n\nThe Brainfuck program must be less than 5,000,000 characters long and take no more than 50,000,000 steps to execute.\n\n**Example:**\n\nInput: $2 + 3$\n\nOutput:  `++>+++><[<+>-]<++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.` \n\n\n\nThe output should be a valid Brainfuck program that, when run, will print the result of the given expression."}, {"prompt_md5": "2b2df114", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "Given a sequence of numbers and plus/minus signs, write a Brainfuck program that calculates the result."}]}
