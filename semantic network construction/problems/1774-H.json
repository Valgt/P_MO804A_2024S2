Maximum Permutationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEcrade bought a deck of cards numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Let the value of a permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ be $$$\\\\min\\\\limits_{i = 1}^{n - k + 1}\\\\ \\\\sum\\\\limits_{j = i}^{i + k - 1}a_j$$$.Ecrade wants to find the most valuable one among all permutations of the cards. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n,k$$$ ($$$4 \\\\leq k < n \\\\leq 10^5$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the largest possible value in the first line. Then in the second line, print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le n$$$, all $$$a_i$$$ are distinct)  — the elements of the permutation that has the largest value.If there are multiple such permutations, output any of them.ExampleInput2 5 4 8 4Output13 1 4 5 3 2 18 4 2 5 7 8 3 1 6NoteIn the first test case, $$$[1,4,5,3,2]$$$ has a value of $$$13$$$. It can be shown that no permutations of length $$$5$$$ have a value greater than $$$13$$$ when $$$k = 4$$$.In the second test case, $$$[4,2,5,7,8,3,1,6]$$$ has a value of $$$18$$$. It can be shown that no permutations of length $$$8$$$ have a value greater than $$$18$$$ when $$$k = 4$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e44c1ee8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an integer $n$ and $k$ where $4 \\le k < n \\le 10^5$.  \n\nYou need to find the largest possible value of the following expression for a permutation of numbers from 1 to $n$:\n\n$$\\min_{i = 1}^{n - k + 1} \\sum_{j = i}^{i + k - 1} a_j$$\n\nwhere $a_j$ represents the $j$th element in the permutation.\n\nFor each test case, output the largest possible value and one permutation that achieves this value."}, {"prompt_md5": "dffaaa93", "template_md5": "465699a0", "result": "You are given a set of numbers and a size 'k'.
