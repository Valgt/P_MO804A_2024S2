Guard Duty (easy)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assignRRebel spaceships to guardBbases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersR,B(1 ≤R,B≤ 10). For1 ≤i≤R, thei+ 1-th line contains two space-separated integersxiandyi(|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of thei-th Rebel spaceship. The followingBlines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.OutputIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, outputYes, otherwise outputNo(without quote).ExamplesInput3 30 02 03 1-2 10 32 2OutputYesInput2 11 02 23 1OutputNoNoteFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "d6a88dd4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $R$ spaceships and $B$ bases.
