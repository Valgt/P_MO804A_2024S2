Count The Rectanglestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ segments drawn on a plane; the $$$i$$$-th segment connects two points ($$$x_{i, 1}$$$, $$$y_{i, 1}$$$) and ($$$x_{i, 2}$$$, $$$y_{i, 2}$$$). Each segment is non-degenerate, and is either horizontal or vertical — formally, for every $$$i \\\\in [1, n]$$$ either $$$x_{i, 1} = x_{i, 2}$$$ or $$$y_{i, 1} = y_{i, 2}$$$ (but only one of these conditions holds). Only segments of different types may intersect: no pair of horizontal segments shares any common points, and no pair of vertical segments shares any common points.We say that four segments having indices $$$h_1$$$, $$$h_2$$$, $$$v_1$$$ and $$$v_2$$$ such that $$$h_1 < h_2$$$ and $$$v_1 < v_2$$$ form a rectangle if the following conditions hold:segments $$$h_1$$$ and $$$h_2$$$ are horizontal;segments $$$v_1$$$ and $$$v_2$$$ are vertical;segment $$$h_1$$$ intersects with segment $$$v_1$$$;segment $$$h_2$$$ intersects with segment $$$v_1$$$;segment $$$h_1$$$ intersects with segment $$$v_2$$$;segment $$$h_2$$$ intersects with segment $$$v_2$$$.Please calculate the number of ways to choose four segments so they form a rectangle. Note that the conditions $$$h_1 < h_2$$$ and $$$v_1 < v_2$$$ should hold.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 5000$$$) — the number of segments.Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains four integers $$$x_{i, 1}$$$, $$$y_{i, 1}$$$, $$$x_{i, 2}$$$ and $$$y_{i, 2}$$$ denoting the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th segment. All coordinates of the endpoints are in the range $$$[-5000, 5000]$$$.It is guaranteed that each segment is non-degenerate and is either horizontal or vertical. Furthermore, if two segments share a common point, one of these segments is horizontal, and another one is vertical.OutputPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose four segments so they form a rectangle.ExamplesInput7 -1 4 -1 -2 6 -1 -2 -1 -2 3 6 3 2 -2 2 4 4 -1 4 3 5 3 5 1 5 2 1 2Output7Input5 1 5 1 0 0 1 5 1 5 4 0 4 4 2 4 0 4 3 4 5Output0NoteThe following pictures represent sample cases:", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "304e0f79", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ line segments on a plane.
