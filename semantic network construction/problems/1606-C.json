Banknotestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn Berland, $$$n$$$ different types of banknotes are used. Banknotes of the $$$i$$$-th type have denomination $$$10^{a_i}$$$ burles (burles are the currency used in Berland); the denomination of banknotes of the first type is exactly $$$1$$$.Let's denote $$$f(s)$$$ as the minimum number of banknotes required to represent exactly $$$s$$$ burles. For example, if the denominations of banknotes used in Berland are $$$1$$$, $$$10$$$ and $$$100$$$, then $$$f(59) = 14$$$: $$$9$$$ banknotes with denomination of $$$1$$$ burle and $$$5$$$ banknotes with denomination of $$$10$$$ burles can be used to represent exactly $$$9 \\\\cdot 1 + 5 \\\\cdot 10 = 59$$$ burles, and there's no way to do it with fewer banknotes.For a given integer $$$k$$$, find the minimum positive number of burles $$$s$$$ that cannot be represented with $$$k$$$ or fewer banknotes (that is, $$$f(s) > k$$$).InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10; 1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$$$).The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 = a_1 < a_2 < \\\\dots < a_n \\\\le 9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum positive number of burles $$$s$$$ that cannot be represented with $$$k$$$ or fewer banknotes.ExampleInput4 3 13 0 1 2 2 777 0 4 3 255 0 1 3 10 1000000000 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Output59 778 148999 999999920999999999", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a1a865f1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given $n$ types of banknotes.
