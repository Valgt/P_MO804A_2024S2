Required Lengthtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integer numbers, $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$. You may perform several operations with the integer $$$x$$$.Each operation you perform is the following one: choose any digit $$$y$$$ that occurs in the decimal representation of $$$x$$$ at least once, and replace $$$x$$$ by $$$x \\\\cdot y$$$.You want to make the length of decimal representation of $$$x$$$ (without leading zeroes) equal to $$$n$$$.
