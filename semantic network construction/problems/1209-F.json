Koala and Notebooktime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKoala Land consists of $$$m$$$ bidirectional roads connecting $$$n$$$ cities. The roads are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ by order in input. It is guaranteed, that one can reach any city from every other city.Koala starts traveling from city $$$1$$$. Whenever he travels on a road, he writes its number down in his notebook. He doesn't put spaces between the numbers, so they all get concatenated into a single number.Before embarking on his trip, Koala is curious about the resulting number for all possible destinations. For each possible destination, what is the smallest number he could have written for it?Since these numbers may be quite large, print their remainders modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. Please note, that you need to compute the remainder of the minimum possible number,notthe minimum possible remainder.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5, n - 1 \\\\le m \\\\le 10^5$$$), the number of cities and the number of roads, respectively.The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le n$$$, $$$x_i \\\\ne y_i$$$), representing a bidirectional road between cities $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$.It is guaranteed, that for any pair of cities there is at most one road connecting them, and that one can reach any city from every other city.OutputPrint $$$n - 1$$$ integers, the answer for every city except for the first city.The $$$i$$$-th integer should be equal to the smallest number he could have written for destination $$$i+1$$$. Since this number may be large, output its remainder modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.ExamplesInput11 10 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 11Output1 12 123 1234 12345 123456 1234567 12345678 123456789 345678826Input12 19 1 2 2 3 2 4 2 5 2 6 2 7 2 8 2 9 2 10 3 11 11 12 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 1 10Output1 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1210 121011Input12 14 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 11 12 1 3 1 4 1 10Output1 12 13 134 1345 13456 1498 149 14 1410 141011", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "99d4e591", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ cities connected by $m$ bidirectional roads.
