Vasya and Binary Stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVasya has a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of digits0and1. Also he has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.Vasya performs the following operation until the string becomes empty: choose someconsecutivesubstring ofequal characters, erase it from the string and glue together the remaining parts (any of them can be empty). For example, if he erases substring111from string111110he will get the string110. Vasya gets $$$a_x$$$ points for erasing substring of length $$$x$$$.Vasya wants to maximize his total points, so help him with this!InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$.The second line contains string $$$s$$$, consisting only of digits0and1.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the number of points for erasing the substring of length $$$i$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum total points Vasya can get.ExamplesInput7 1101001 3 4 9 100 1 2 3Output109Input5 10101 3 10 15 15 15Output23NoteIn the first example the optimal sequence of erasings is:1101001$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$111001$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$11101$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$1111$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$\\\\varnothing$$$.In the second example the optimal sequence of erasings is:10101$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$1001$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$11$$$\\\\rightarrow$$$ $$$\\\\varnothing$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "b2258455", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a binary string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of 0s and 1s.
