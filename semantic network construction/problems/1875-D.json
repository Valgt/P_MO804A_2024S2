Jellyfish and Mextime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array of $$$n$$$ nonnegative integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$.Let $$$m$$$ be a variable that is initialized to $$$0$$$, Jellyfish will perform the following operation $$$n$$$ times:select an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq |a|$$$) and delete $$$a_i$$$ from $$$a$$$.add $$$\\\\operatorname{MEX}(a)^{\\\\dagger}$$$ to $$$m$$$.Now Jellyfish wants to know the minimum possible final value of $$$m$$$ if he performs all the operations optimally.$$$^{\\\\dagger}$$$ The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:The MEX of $$$[2,2,1]$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the array.The MEX of $$$[3,1,0,1]$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the array, but $$$2$$$ does not.The MEX of $$$[0,3,1,2]$$$ is $$$4$$$ because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$ belong to the array, but $$$4$$$ does not.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 5000$$$) — the size of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the integers in the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum value of $$$m$$$ if the operations are performed optimally.ExampleInput485 2 1 0 3 0 4 021 251 0 2 114514 080 1 2 0 1 2 0 3Output3 0 2 7NoteIn the first test case, we delete elements from $$$a$$$ in the following order: $$$[5,2,\\\\color{red}{1},0,3,0,4,0] \\\\to [5,2,0,3,\\\\color{red}{0},4,0] \\\\to [5,2,\\\\color{red}{0},3,4,0] \\\\to [5,2,3,4,\\\\color{red}{0}] \\\\to [5,2,\\\\color{red}{3},4] \\\\to [\\\\color{red}{5},2,4] \\\\to [\\\\color{red}{2},4] \\\\to [\\\\color{red}{4}] \\\\to [~]$$$.
