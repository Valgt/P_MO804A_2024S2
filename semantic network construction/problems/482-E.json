The tree root is in the vertex1.Each vertex (except fot the tree root)vhas a direct ancestorpv. Also each vertexvhas its integer valuesv.Your task is to perform following queries:Pvu(u≠v).

Perform assignmentsv=t.Your task is following. Before starting performing queries and after each query you have to calculate expected value written on the lowest common ancestor of two equiprobably selected verticesiandj. Here lowest common ancestor ofiandjis the deepest vertex that lies on the both of the path from the root to vertexiand the path from the root to vertexj. Please note that the verticesiandjcan be the same (in this case their lowest common ancestor coincides with them).InputThe first line of the input contains integern(2 ≤n≤ 5·104) — the number of the tree vertexes.The second line containsn- 1integerp2,p3, ...,pn(1 ≤pi≤n) — the description of the tree edges. It is guaranteed that those numbers form a tree.The third line containsnintegers —s1,s2, ...sn(0 ≤si≤ 106) — the values written on each vertex of the tree.The next line contains integerq(1 ≤q≤ 5·104) — the number of queries.
