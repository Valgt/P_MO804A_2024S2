Shuffletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a binary string (i. e. a string consisting of characters0and/or1) $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation with the string $$$s$$$at most once: choose a substring (a contiguous subsequence) of $$$s$$$ havingexactly$$$k$$$ characters1in it, and shuffle it (reorder the characters in the substring as you wish).Calculate the number of different strings which can be obtained from $$$s$$$ by performing this operation at most once.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 5000$$$; $$$0 \\\\le k \\\\le n$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of characters0and/or1.OutputPrint one integer — the number of different strings which can be obtained from $$$s$$$ by performing the described operation at most once.
