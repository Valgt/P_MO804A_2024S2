SMSCtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutSome large corporation where Polycarpus works has its own short message service center (SMSC). The center's task is to send all sorts of crucial information. Polycarpus decided to check the efficiency of the SMSC.For that, he asked to give him the statistics of the performance of the SMSC for some period of time. In the end, Polycarpus got a list ofntasks that went to the SMSC of the corporation. Each task was described by the time it was received by the SMSC and the number of text messages to send. More formally, thei-th task was described by two integerstiandci— the receiving time (the second) and the number of the text messages, correspondingly.Polycarpus knows that the SMSC cannot send more than one text message per second. The SMSC uses a queue to organize its work. Consider a time momentx, the SMSC work at that moment as follows:If at the time momentxthe queue is not empty, then SMSC sends one message from the queue (SMSC gets the message from the head of the queue). Otherwise it doesn't send messages at the time momentx.If at the time momentxSMSC receives a task, then it adds to the queue all the messages from this task (SMSC adds messages to the tail of the queue). Note, that the messages from the task cannot be send at time momentx. That's because the decision about sending message or not is made at point 1 before adding these messages to the queue.Given the information about allntasks, Polycarpus wants to count two values: the time when the last text message was sent and the maximum size of the queue at some time. Help him count these two characteristics he needs to evaluate the efficiency of the SMSC.InputThe first line contains a single integern(1 ≤n≤ 103)— the number of tasks of the SMSC. Nextnlines contain the tasks' descriptions: thei-th line contains two space-separated integerstiandci(1 ≤ti,ci≤ 106)— the time (the second) when thei-th task was received and the number of messages to send, correspondingly.It is guaranteed that all tasks were received at different moments of time. It is guaranteed that the tasks are sorted in the chronological order, that is,ti<ti+ 1for all integeri(1 ≤i<n).OutputIn a single line print two space-separated integers — the time when the last text message was sent and the maximum queue size at a certain moment of time.ExamplesInput21 12 1Output3 1Input11000000 10Output1000010 10Input33 34 35 3Output12 7NoteIn the first test sample:second 1: the first message has appeared in the queue, the queue's size is 1;second 2: the first message is sent, the second message has been received, the queue's size is 1;second 3: the second message is sent, the queue's size is 0,Thus, the maximum size of the queue is 1, the last message was sent at the second 3.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f9a63d68", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of tasks, where each task has a time and a number of messages to send.
