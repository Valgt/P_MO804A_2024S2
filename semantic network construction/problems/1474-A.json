Puzzle From the Futuretime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn the$$$2022$$$year, Mike found two binary integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ (both of them are written only by digits $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$) that can have leading zeroes. In order not to forget them, he wanted to construct integer $$$d$$$ in the following way:he creates an integer $$$c$$$ as a result of bitwise summing of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$without transferring carry, so $$$c$$$ may have one or more $$$2$$$-s. For example, the result of bitwise summing of $$$0110$$$ and $$$1101$$$ is $$$1211$$$ or the sum of $$$011000$$$ and $$$011000$$$ is $$$022000$$$;after that Mike replaces equal consecutive digits in $$$c$$$ by one digit, thus getting $$$d$$$. In the cases above after this operation, $$$1211$$$ becomes $$$121$$$ and $$$022000$$$ becomes $$$020$$$ (so, $$$d$$$ won't have equal consecutive digits).Unfortunately, Mike lost integer $$$a$$$ before he could calculate $$$d$$$ himself. Now, to cheer him up, you want to findany binaryinteger $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that $$$d$$$ will bemaximum possible as integer.Maximum possible as integer means that $$$102 > 21$$$, $$$012 < 101$$$, $$$021 = 21$$$ and so on.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.The second line of each test case contains binary integer $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The integer $$$b$$$ consists only of digits $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.It is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ over all $$$t$$$ test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case output onebinaryinteger $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Note, that $$$a$$$ or $$$b$$$ may have leading zeroes but must have the same length $$$n$$$.ExampleInput5 1 0 3 011 3 110 6 111000 6 001011Output1 110 100 101101 101110NoteIn the first test case, $$$b = 0$$$ and choosing $$$a = 1$$$ gives $$$d = 1$$$ as a result.In the second test case, $$$b = 011$$$ so:if you choose $$$a = 000$$$, $$$c$$$ will be equal to $$$011$$$, so $$$d = 01$$$;if you choose $$$a = 111$$$, $$$c$$$ will be equal to $$$122$$$, so $$$d = 12$$$;if you choose $$$a = 010$$$, you'll get $$$d = 021$$$.If you select $$$a = 110$$$, you'll get $$$d = 121$$$.We can show that answer $$$a = 110$$$ is optimal and $$$d = 121$$$ is maximum possible.In the third test case, $$$b = 110$$$. If you choose $$$a = 100$$$, you'll get $$$d = 210$$$ and it's the maximum possible $$$d$$$.In the fourth test case, $$$b = 111000$$$. If you choose $$$a = 101101$$$, you'll get $$$d = 212101$$$ and it's maximum possible $$$d$$$.In the fifth test case, $$$b = 001011$$$. If you choose $$$a = 101110$$$, you'll get $$$d = 102121$$$ and it's maximum possible $$$d$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "393bb4bb", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a binary integer $b$ of length $n$.
