Kamil and Making a Streamtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test768 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKamil likes streaming the competitive programming videos. His MeTube channel has recently reached $$$100$$$ million subscribers. In order to celebrate this, he posted a video with an interesting problem he couldn't solve yet. Can you help him?You're given a tree — a connected undirected graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices connected by $$$n - 1$$$ edges. The tree is rooted at vertex $$$1$$$. A vertex $$$u$$$ is called anancestorof $$$v$$$ if it lies on the shortest path between the root and $$$v$$$. In particular, a vertex is an ancestor of itself.Each vertex $$$v$$$ is assigned itsbeauty$$$x_v$$$ — a non-negative integer not larger than $$$10^{12}$$$. This allows us to define the beauty of a path. Let $$$u$$$ be an ancestor of $$$v$$$. Then we define the beauty $$$f(u, v)$$$ as the greatest common divisor of the beauties of all vertices on the shortest path between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. Formally, if $$$u=t_1, t_2, t_3, \\\\dots, t_k=v$$$ are the vertices on the shortest path between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, then $$$f(u, v) = \\\\gcd(x_{t_1}, x_{t_2}, \\\\dots, x_{t_k})$$$. Here, $$$\\\\gcd$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor of a set of numbers. In particular, $$$f(u, u) = \\\\gcd(x_u) = x_u$$$.Your task is to find the sum$$$$$$ \\\\sum_{u\\\\text{ is an ancestor of }v} f(u, v). $$$$$$As the result might be too large, please output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.Note that for each $$$y$$$, $$$\\\\gcd(0, y) = \\\\gcd(y, 0) = y$$$. In particular, $$$\\\\gcd(0, 0) = 0$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100\\\\,000$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le x_i \\\\le 10^{12}$$$). The value $$$x_v$$$ denotes the beauty of vertex $$$v$$$.The following $$$n - 1$$$ lines describe the edges of the tree. Each of them contains two integers $$$a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a, b \\\\le n$$$, $$$a \\\\neq b$$$) — the vertices connected by a single edge.OutputOutput the sum of the beauties on all paths $$$(u, v)$$$ such that $$$u$$$ is ancestor of $$$v$$$. This sum should be printed modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExamplesInput5 4 5 6 0 8 1 2 1 3 1 4 4 5Output42Input7 0 2 3 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 3 6 3 7Output30NoteThe following figure shows all $$$10$$$ possible paths for which one endpoint is an ancestor of another endpoint.
