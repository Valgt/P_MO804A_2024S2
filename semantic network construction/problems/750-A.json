The contest will start at 20:00 and will last four hours, exactly until midnight. There will benproblems, sorted by difficulty, i.e. problem1is the easiest and problemnis the hardest. Limak knows it will take him5·iminutes to solve thei-th problem.Limak's friends organize a New Year's Eve party and Limak wants to be there at midnight or earlier. He needskminutes to get there from his house, where he will participate in the contest first.How many problems can Limak solve if he wants to make it to the party?InputThe only line of the input contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 10,1 ≤k≤ 240) — the number of the problems in the contest and the number of minutes Limak needs to get to the party from his house.OutputPrint one integer, denoting the maximum possible number of problems Limak can solve so that he could get to the party at midnight or earlier.ExamplesInput3 222Output2Input4 190Output4Input7 1Output7NoteIn the first sample, there are3problems and Limak needs222minutes to get to the party. The three problems require5,10and15minutes respectively. Limak can spend5 + 10 = 15minutes to solve first two problems. Then, at 20:15 he can leave his house to get to the party at 23:57 (after222minutes). In this scenario Limak would solve2problems. He doesn't have enough time to solve3problems so the answer is2.In the second sample, Limak can solve all4problems in5 + 10 + 15 + 20 = 50minutes. At 20:50 he will leave the house and go to the party. He will get there exactly at midnight.In the third sample, Limak needs only1minute to get to the party. He has enough time to solve all7problems.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1c35e63c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "There are $n$ problems to solve, with the $i$-th problem taking $5i$ minutes to solve.
