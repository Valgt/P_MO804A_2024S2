You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.You are given two positive integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$.Count the number of distinct triplets of integers $$$(i, j, k)$$$ such that $$$l \\\\le i < j < k \\\\le r$$$ and $$$\\\\operatorname{lcm}(i,j,k) \\\\ge i + j + k$$$.Here $$$\\\\operatorname{lcm}(i, j, k)$$$ denotes theleast common multiple (LCM)of integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, and $$$k$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$\\\\bf{1 \\\\le t \\\\le 5}$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The only line for each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$l + 2 \\\\le r$$$).OutputFor each test case print one integer — the number of suitable triplets.ExampleInput51 43 58 8668 866 86868Output3 1 78975 969 109229059713337NoteIn the first test case, there are $$$3$$$ suitable triplets:$$$(1,2,3)$$$,$$$(1,3,4)$$$,$$$(2,3,4)$$$.In the second test case, there is $$$1$$$ suitable triplet:$$$(3,4,5)$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "cc63a478", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two positive integers $l$ and $r$.
