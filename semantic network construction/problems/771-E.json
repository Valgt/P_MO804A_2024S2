No two chosen rectangles should share a cell. What is the maximum possible number of nice rectangles Limak can choose?InputThe first line of the input contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 300 000) — the number of columns in the grid.The next two lines contain numbers in the grid.

He should take three nice rectangles: those denoted as blue frames on the drawings.In the second sample, it's optimal to choose six nice rectangles, each consisting of one cell with a number0.In the third sample, the only nice rectangle is the whole grid — the sum of all numbers is0. Clearly, Limak can choose at most one nice rectangle, so the answer is1.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "18b153a1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a 2 by $n$ grid of integers.
