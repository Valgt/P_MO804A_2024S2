You are at a laundromat that hasn1washing machines,n2drying machines andn3folding machines. Each machine can process only one piece of laundry at a time. You can't dry a piece of laundry before it is washed, and you can't fold it before it is dried. Moreover, after a piece of laundry is washed, it needs to be immediately moved into a drying machine, and after it is dried, it needs to be immediately moved into a folding machine.It takest1minutes to wash one piece of laundry in a washing machine,t2minutes to dry it in a drying machine, andt3minutes to fold it in a folding machine. Find the smallest number of minutes that is enough to wash, dry and fold all the laundry you have.InputThe only line of the input contains seven integers:k,n1,n2,n3,t1,t2,t3(1 ≤k≤ 104; 1 ≤n1,n2,n3,t1,t2,t3≤ 1000).OutputPrint one integer — smallest number of minutes to do all your laundry.ExamplesInput1 1 1 1 5 5 5Output15Input8 4 3 2 10 5 2Output32NoteIn the first example there's one instance of each machine, each taking 5 minutes to complete. You have only one piece of laundry, so it takes 15 minutes to process it.In the second example you start washing first two pieces at moment0. If you start the third piece of laundry immediately, then by the time it is dried, there will be no folding machine available, so you have to wait, and start washing third piece at moment2. Similarly, you can't start washing next piece until moment5, since otherwise there will be no dryer available, when it is washed. Start time for each of the eight pieces of laundry is0, 0, 2, 5, 10, 10, 12and15minutes respectively.
