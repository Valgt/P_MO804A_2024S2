Inversion Graphtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$$$. Then, an undirected graph is constructed in the following way: add an edge between vertices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ if and only if $$$p_i > p_j$$$. Your task is to count the number of connected components in this graph.Two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ belong to the same connected component if and only if there is at least one path along edges connecting $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$) — the elements of the permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print one integer $$$k$$$ — the number of connected components.ExampleInput631 2 352 1 4 3 566 1 4 2 5 31163 2 1 6 5 453 1 5 2 4Output3 3 1 1 2 1NoteEach separate test case is depicted in the image below.

A permutation is a list of  $n$ distinct integers from 1 to $n$ in some order.\n\nFor example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not (because 2 appears twice) and $[1,3,4]$ is not (because $n=3$ but there is a 4 in the list).\n\nWe build a graph based on this permutation:\n\n*  There is an edge between two numbers $i$ and $j$ if and only if $i < j$ and the number at position $i$ in the permutation is larger than the number at position $j$.\n\nYour task is to count the number of connected components in this graph.
