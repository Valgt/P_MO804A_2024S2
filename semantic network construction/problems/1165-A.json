Remaindertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a huge decimal number consisting of $$$n$$$ digits. It is guaranteed that this number has no leading zeros. Each digit of this number is either0or1.You may perform several (possibly zero) operations with this number. During each operation you are allowed to change any digit of your number; you may change0to1or1to0. It is possible that after some operation you can obtain a number with leading zeroes, but it does not matter for this problem.You are also given two integers $$$0 \\\\le y < x < n$$$. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations you should perform to obtain the number that has remainder $$$10^y$$$ modulo $$$10^x$$$. In other words, the obtained number should have remainder $$$10^y$$$ when divided by $$$10^x$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains three integers $$$n, x, y$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le y < x < n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the number and the integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, respectively.The second line of the input contains one decimal number consisting of $$$n$$$ digits, each digit of this number is either0or1. It is guaranteed that the first digit of the number is1.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum number of operations you should perform to obtain the number having remainder $$$10^y$$$ modulo $$$10^x$$$. In other words, the obtained number should have remainder $$$10^y$$$ when divided by $$$10^x$$$.ExamplesInput11 5 2 11010100101Output1Input11 5 1 11010100101Output3NoteIn the first example the number will be $$$11010100100$$$ after performing one operation.
