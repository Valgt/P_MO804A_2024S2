Toss a Coin to Your Graph...time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOne day Masha was walking in the park and found a graph under a tree... Surprised? Did you think that this problem would have some logical and reasoned story? No way! So, the problem...Masha has an oriented graph which $$$i$$$-th vertex contains some positive integer $$$a_i$$$. Initially Masha can put a coin at some vertex. In one operation she can move a coin placed in some vertex $$$u$$$ to any other vertex $$$v$$$ such that there is an oriented edge $$$u \\\\to v$$$ in the graph. Each time when the coin is placed in some vertex $$$i$$$, Masha write down an integer $$$a_i$$$ in her notebook (in particular, when Masha initially puts a coin at some vertex, she writes an integer written at this vertex in her notebook). Masha wants to make exactly $$$k - 1$$$ operations in such way that the maximum number written in her notebook is as small as possible.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\\\le m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the number of operation that Masha should make.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$) — the numbers written in graph vertices.Each of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le u \\\\ne v \\\\le n$$$) — it means that there is an edge $$$u \\\\to v$$$ in the graph.It's guaranteed that graph doesn't contain loops and multi-edges.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum value of the maximum number that Masha wrote in her notebook during optimal coin movements.If Masha won't be able to perform $$$k - 1$$$ operations, print $$$-1$$$.ExamplesInput6 7 4 1 10 2 3 4 5 1 2 1 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 2 2 5Output4Input6 7 100 1 10 2 3 4 5 1 2 1 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 2 2 5Output10Input2 1 5 1 1 1 2Output-1Input1 0 1 1000000000Output1000000000NoteGraph described in the first and the second examples is illustrated below.In the first example Masha can initially put a coin at vertex $$$1$$$. After that she can perform three operations: $$$1 \\\\to 3$$$, $$$3 \\\\to 4$$$ and $$$4 \\\\to 5$$$. Integers $$$1, 2, 3$$$ and $$$4$$$ will be written in the notepad.In the second example Masha can initially put a coin at vertex $$$2$$$. After that she can perform $$$99$$$ operations: $$$2 \\\\to 5$$$, $$$5 \\\\to 6$$$, $$$6 \\\\to 2$$$, $$$2 \\\\to 5$$$, and so on. Integers $$$10, 4, 5, 10, 4, 5, \\\\ldots, 10, 4, 5, 10$$$ will be written in the notepad.In the third example Masha won't be able to perform $$$4$$$ operations.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "a2c572f5", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a directed graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.
