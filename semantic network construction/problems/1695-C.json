Zero Pathtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. We denote the square on the $$$i$$$-th ($$$1\\\\le i\\\\le n$$$) row and $$$j$$$-th ($$$1\\\\le j\\\\le m$$$) column by $$$(i, j)$$$ and the number there by $$$a_{ij}$$$. All numbers are equal to $$$1$$$ or to $$$-1$$$.You start from the square $$$(1, 1)$$$ and can move one square down or one square to the right at a time. In the end, you want to end up at the square $$$(n, m)$$$.Is it possible to move in such a way so that the sum of the values written in all the visited cells (including $$$a_{11}$$$ and $$$a_{nm}$$$) is $$$0$$$?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 1000$$$)  — the size of the grid.Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers. The $$$j$$$-th integer on the $$$i$$$-th line is $$$a_{ij}$$$ ($$$a_{ij} = 1$$$ or $$$-1$$$)  — the element in the cell $$$(i, j)$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n\\\\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, print \"YES\" if there exists a path from the top left to the bottom right that adds up to $$$0$$$, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output each letter in any case.ExampleInput51 111 21 -11 41 -1 1 -13 41 -1 -1 -1-1 1 1 -11 1 1 -13 41 -1 1 1-1 1 -1 11 -1 1 1OutputNO YES YES YES NONoteOne possible path for the fourth test case is given in the picture in the statement.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "86b6a647", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a grid of $n$ rows and $m$ columns.
