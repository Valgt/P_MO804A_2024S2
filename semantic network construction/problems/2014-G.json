Milky Daystime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWhat is done is done, and the spoilt milk cannot be helped.Little John is as little as night is day â€” he was known to be a giant, at possibly $$$2.1$$$ metres tall. It has everything to do with his love for milk.His dairy diary has $$$n$$$ entries, showing that he acquired $$$a_i$$$ pints of fresh milk on day $$$d_i$$$. Milk declines in freshness with time and stays drinkable for a maximum of $$$k$$$ days. In other words, fresh milk acquired on day $$$d_i$$$ will be drinkable between days $$$d_i$$$ and $$$d_i+k-1$$$ inclusive.Every day, Little John drinks drinkable milk, up to a maximum of $$$m$$$ pints. In other words, if there are less than $$$m$$$ pints of milk, he will drink them all and not be satisfied; if there are at least $$$m$$$ pints of milk, he will drink exactly $$$m$$$ pints and be satisfied, and it's amilk satisfaction day.Little John always drinksthe freshestdrinkable milk first.Determine the number ofmilk satisfaction daysfor Little John.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$), the number of test cases.The first line of each test case consists of three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k \\\\le 10^5$$$), the number of diary entries, the maximum pints needed for a milk satisfaction day, and the duration of milk's freshness.Then follow $$$n$$$ lines of each test case, each with two integers $$$d_i$$$ and $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1\\\\le d_i$$$, $$$a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$), the day on which the milk was acquired and the number of pints acquired. They are sorted in increasing values of $$$d_i$$$, and all values of $$$d_i$$$ are distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer, the number ofmilk satisfaction days.ExampleInput61 1 31 52 3 31 52 74 5 21 92 64 95 65 2 44 75 37 111 212 14 1 35 109 414 815 35 5 58 910 716 1021 528 9Output3 3 4 5 10 6NoteIn the first test case, $$$5$$$ pints of milk are good for $$$3$$$ days before spoiling.In the second test case, the following will happen:On day $$$1$$$, he will receive $$$5$$$ pints of milk and drink $$$3$$$ of them (leaving $$$2$$$ pints from day $$$1$$$);On day $$$2$$$, he will receive $$$7$$$ pints of milk and drink $$$3$$$ of them (leaving $$$2$$$ pints from day $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ pints from day $$$2$$$);On day $$$3$$$, he will drink $$$3$$$ pints from day $$$2$$$ (leaving $$$2$$$ pints from day $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ pint from day $$$2$$$);On day $$$4$$$, the milk acquired on day $$$1$$$ will spoil, and he will drink $$$1$$$ pint from day $$$2$$$ (no more milk is left).", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1bdfafa8", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a list of $n$ days, where on each day $d_i$, $a_i$ pints of milk are acquired.
