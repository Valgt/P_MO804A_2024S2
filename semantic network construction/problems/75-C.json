Modified GCDtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutWell, here is another math class task. In mathematics, GCD is the greatest common divisor, and it's an easy task to calculate the GCD between two positive integers.A common divisor for two positive numbers is a number which both numbers are divisible by.But your teacher wants to give you a harder task, in this task you have to find the greatest common divisordbetween two integersaandbthat is in a given range fromlowtohigh(inclusive), i.e.low≤d≤high. It is possible that there is no common divisor in the given range.You will be given the two integersaandb, thennqueries. Each query is a range fromlowtohighand you have to answer each query.InputThe first line contains two integersaandb, the two integers as described above (1 ≤a,b≤ 109). The second line contains one integern, the number of queries (1 ≤n≤ 104). Thennlines follow, each line contains one query consisting of two integers,lowandhigh(1 ≤low≤high≤ 109).OutputPrintnlines. Thei-th of them should contain the result of thei-th query in the input. If there is no common divisor in the given range for any query, you should print-1as a result for this query.ExamplesInput9 2731 510 119 11Output3-19", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "913e9dcf", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two integers $a$ and $b$.
