Sasha and the Casinotime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha places a bet of $$$y$$$ coins (where $$$y$$$ is a positive integer), then in case of winning, he will receive $$$y \\\\cdot k$$$ coins (i.e., his number of coins will increase by $$$y \\\\cdot (k - 1)$$$). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by $$$y$$$).Note that the bet amount must always be a positive ($$$> 0$$$) integer and cannot exceed Sasha's current number of coins.Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more than $$$x$$$ times in a row.Initially, Sasha has $$$a$$$ coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that for any integer $$$n$$$, Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at least $$$n$$$ coins.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The single line of each test case contains three integers $$$k, x$$$ and $$$a$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 30$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 100$$$, $$$1 \\\\leq a \\\\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses, and the initial number of coins Sasha has.OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.You can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\" and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput92 1 72 1 12 3 153 3 64 4 55 4 74 88 100000000025 69 23113 97 18806OutputYES NO YES NO NO YES NO NO NONoteIn the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places $$$1$$$ coin.If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places $$$2$$$ coins.Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he wants.In the second test case, Sasha can only place $$$1$$$ coin for the first time. But in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "f4090209", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given three integers:\n\n*  $k$:  The number of times the bet is increased in case of a win.\n*  $x$: The maximum number of consecutive losses allowed.\n*  $a$: The initial number of coins.\n\nDetermine if it is possible to place bets such that, regardless of the outcome (win or lose), you can guarantee having at least $n$ coins at some point, where $n$ is any positive integer.\n\nYou can bet any positive integer amount of coins, but the bet amount cannot exceed your current number of coins.
