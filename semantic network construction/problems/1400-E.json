Initially, it contains $$$a_1$$$ elements equal to $$$1$$$, $$$a_2$$$ elements equal to $$$2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ elements equal to $$$n$$$.You may apply two types of operations:choose two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$l \\\\le r$$$), then remove one occurrence of $$$l$$$, one occurrence of $$$l + 1$$$, ..., one occurrence of $$$r$$$ from the multiset. This operation can be applied only if each number from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ occurs at least once in the multiset;choose two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$x \\\\ge 1$$$), then remove $$$x$$$ occurrences of $$$i$$$ from the multiset.
