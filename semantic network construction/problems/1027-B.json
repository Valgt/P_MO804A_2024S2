Numbers on the Chessboardtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a chessboard of size $$$n \\\\times n$$$. It is filled with numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n^2$$$ in the following way: the first $$$\\\\lceil \\\\frac{n^2}{2} \\\\rceil$$$ numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$\\\\lceil \\\\frac{n^2}{2} \\\\rceil$$$ are written in the cells with even sum of coordinates from left to right from top to bottom. The rest $$$n^2 - \\\\lceil \\\\frac{n^2}{2} \\\\rceil$$$ numbers from $$$\\\\lceil \\\\frac{n^2}{2} \\\\rceil + 1$$$ to $$$n^2$$$ are written in the cells with odd sum of coordinates from left to right from top to bottom. The operation $$$\\\\lceil\\\\frac{x}{y}\\\\rceil$$$ means division $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$ rounded up.For example, the left board on the following picture is the chessboard which is given for $$$n=4$$$ and the right board is the chessboard which is given for $$$n=5$$$.You are given $$$q$$$ queries. The $$$i$$$-th query is described as a pair $$$x_i, y_i$$$. The answer to the $$$i$$$-th query is the number written in the cell $$$x_i, y_i$$$ ($$$x_i$$$ is the row, $$$y_i$$$ is the column). Rows and columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the size of the board and the number of queries.The next $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers each. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$x_i, y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x_i, y_i \\\\le n$$$) — description of the $$$i$$$-th query.OutputFor each query from $$$1$$$ to $$$q$$$ print the answer to this query. The answer to the $$$i$$$-th query is the number written in the cell $$$x_i, y_i$$$ ($$$x_i$$$ is the row, $$$y_i$$$ is the column). Rows and columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.
