Reordertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor a given array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers and a given integer $$$m$$$ find if it is possible to reorder elements of the array $$$a$$$ in such a way that $$$\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\\\sum_{j=i}^{n}{\\\\frac{a_j}{j}}}$$$ equals $$$m$$$? It is forbidden to delete elements as well as insert new elements. Please note that no rounding occurs during division, for example, $$$\\\\frac{5}{2}=2.5$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ — the number of test cases ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 100$$$). The test cases follow, each in two lines.The first line of a test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$$$, $$$0 \\\\le m \\\\le 10^6$$$). The second line contains integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array.OutputFor each test case print \"YES\", if it is possible to reorder the elements of the array in such a way that the given formula gives the given value, and \"NO\" otherwise.ExampleInput2 3 8 2 5 1 4 4 0 1 2 3OutputYES NONoteIn the first test case one of the reorders could be $$$[1, 2, 5]$$$. The sum is equal to $$$(\\\\frac{1}{1} + \\\\frac{2}{2} + \\\\frac{5}{3}) + (\\\\frac{2}{2} + \\\\frac{5}{3}) + (\\\\frac{5}{3}) = 8$$$. The brackets denote the inner sum $$$\\\\sum_{j=i}^{n}{\\\\frac{a_j}{j}}$$$, while the summation of brackets corresponds to the sum over $$$i$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "7dec857a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers  $a$ with $n$ elements and an integer $m$.
