Lanternstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ lanterns in a row. The lantern $$$i$$$ is placed in position $$$i$$$ and has power equal to $$$p_i$$$.Each lantern can be directed to illuminate either some lanterns to the left or some lanterns to the right. If the $$$i$$$-th lantern is turned to the left, it illuminates all such lanterns $$$j$$$ that $$$j \\\\in [i - p_i, i - 1]$$$. Similarly, if it is turned to the right, it illuminates all such lanterns $$$j$$$ that $$$j \\\\in [i + 1, i + p_i]$$$.Your goal is to choose a direction for each lantern so each lantern is illuminated by at least one other lantern, or report that it is impossible.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of lanterns.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le p_i \\\\le n$$$) — the power of the $$$i$$$-th lantern.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the answer as follows:If it is possible to direct all lanterns so that each lantern is illuminated, printYESin the first line and a string of $$$n$$$ charactersLand/orR(the $$$i$$$-th character isLif the $$$i$$$-th lantern is turned to the left, otherwise this character isR) in the second line.
