Permutation Addictstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and a threshold $$$k$$$ with $$$0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n$$$, you compute a sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ as follows.For every $$$1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$$$ in increasing order, let $$$x = a_i$$$.If $$$x \\\\leq k$$$, set $$$b_{x}$$$ to the last element $$$a_j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq j < i$$$) that $$$a_j > k$$$. If no such element $$$a_j$$$ exists, set $$$b_{x} = n+1$$$.If $$$x > k$$$, set $$$b_{x}$$$ to the last element $$$a_j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq j < i$$$) that $$$a_j \\\\leq k$$$. If no such element $$$a_j$$$ exists, set $$$b_{x} = 0$$$.Unfortunately, after the sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ has been completely computed, the permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ and the threshold $$$k$$$ are discarded.Now you only have the sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$. Your task is to find any possible permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ and threshold $$$k$$$ that produce the sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$.It is guaranteed thatthere exists at least one pair of permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ and threshold $$$k$$$ that produce the sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$.A permutation of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is a sequence of length $$$n$$$ which contains all integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$), indicating the length of the permutation $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq b_i \\\\leq n+1$$$), indicating the elements of the sequence $$$b$$$.It is guaranteed thatthere exists at least one pair of permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ and threshold $$$k$$$ that produce the sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the threshold $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n$$$) in the first line, and then output the permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq n$$$) in the second line such that the permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ and threshold $$$k$$$ produce the sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.ExampleInput345 3 1 267 7 7 3 3 364 4 4 0 0 0Output2 1 3 2 4 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 6 5 4 3 2 1NoteFor the first test case, permutation $$$a = [1,3,2,4]$$$ and threshold $$$k = 2$$$ will produce sequence $$$b$$$ as follows.When $$$i = 1$$$, $$$x = a_i = 1 \\\\leq k$$$, there is no $$$a_j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq j < i$$$) that $$$a_j > k$$$. Therefore, $$$b_1 = n + 1 = 5$$$.When $$$i = 2$$$, $$$x = a_i = 3 > k$$$, the last element $$$a_j$$$ that $$$a_j \\\\leq k$$$ is $$$a_1$$$. Therefore, $$$b_3 = a_1 = 1$$$.When $$$i = 3$$$, $$$x = a_i = 2 \\\\leq k$$$, the last element $$$a_j$$$ that $$$a_j > k$$$ is $$$a_2$$$. Therefore, $$$b_2 = a_2 = 3$$$.When $$$i = 4$$$, $$$x = a_i = 4 > k$$$, the last element $$$a_j$$$ that $$$a_j \\\\leq k$$$ is $$$a_3$$$. Therefore, $$$b_4 = a_3 = 2$$$.Finally, we obtain sequence $$$b = [5,3,1,2]$$$.For the second test case, permutation $$$a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]$$$ and threshold $$$k = 3$$$ will produce sequence $$$b$$$ as follows.When $$$i = 1, 2, 3$$$, $$$a_i \\\\leq k$$$, there is no $$$a_j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq j < i$$$) that $$$a_j > k$$$. Therefore, $$$b_1 = b_2 = b_3 = n + 1 = 7$$$.When $$$i = 4, 5, 6$$$, $$$a_i > k$$$, the last element $$$a_j$$$ that $$$a_j \\\\leq k$$$ is $$$a_3$$$. Therefore, $$$b_4 = b_5 = b_6 = a_3 = 3$$$.Finally, we obtain sequence $$$b = [7,7,7,3,3,3]$$$.For the third test case, permutation $$$a = [6,5,4,3,2,1]$$$ and threshold $$$k = 3$$$ will produce sequence $$$b$$$ as follows.When $$$i = 1, 2, 3$$$, $$$a_i > k$$$, there is no $$$a_j$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq j < i$$$) that $$$a_j \\\\leq k$$$. Therefore, $$$b_4 = b_5 = b_6 = 0$$$.When $$$i = 4, 5, 6$$$, $$$a_i \\\\leq k$$$, the last element $$$a_j$$$ that $$$a_j > k$$$ is $$$a_3$$$. Therefore, $$$b_1 = b_2 = b_3 = a_3 = 4$$$.Finally, we obtain sequence $$$b = [4,4,4,0,0,0]$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "3568fcf4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$.
