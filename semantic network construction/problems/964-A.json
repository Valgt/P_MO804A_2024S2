Splitstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's define a split of $$$n$$$ as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is $$$n$$$.For example, the following sequences are splits of $$$8$$$: $$$[4, 4]$$$, $$$[3, 3, 2]$$$, $$$[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$, $$$[5, 2, 1]$$$.The following sequences aren't splits of $$$8$$$: $$$[1, 7]$$$, $$$[5, 4]$$$, $$$[11, -3]$$$, $$$[1, 1, 4, 1, 1]$$$.The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split $$$[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$ is $$$5$$$, the weight of the split $$$[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$$$ is $$$2$$$ and the weight of the split $$$[9]$$$ equals $$$1$$$.For a given $$$n$$$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^9$$$).OutputOutput one integer — the answer to the problem.ExamplesInput7Output4Input8Output5Input9Output5NoteIn the first sample, there are following possible weights of splits of $$$7$$$:Weight 1: [$$$\\\\textbf 7$$$]Weight 2: [$$$\\\\textbf 3$$$, $$$\\\\textbf 3$$$, 1]Weight 3: [$$$\\\\textbf 2$$$, $$$\\\\textbf 2$$$, $$$\\\\textbf 2$$$, 1]Weight 7: [$$$\\\\textbf 1$$$, $$$\\\\textbf 1$$$, $$$\\\\textbf 1$$$, $$$\\\\textbf 1$$$, $$$\\\\textbf 1$$$, $$$\\\\textbf 1$$$, $$$\\\\textbf 1$$$]", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "6c81bad2", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a positive integer $n$.
