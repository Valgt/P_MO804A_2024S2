Turtle and Piggy Are Playing a Game 2time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTurtle and Piggy are playing a game on a sequence. They are given a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$, and Turtle goes first. Turtle and Piggy alternate in turns (so, Turtle does the first turn, Piggy does the second, Turtle does the third, etc.).The game goes as follows:Let the current length of the sequence be $$$m$$$. If $$$m = 1$$$, the game ends.If the game does not end and it's Turtle's turn, then Turtle must choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le m - 1$$$, set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$\\\\max(a_i, a_{i + 1})$$$, and remove $$$a_{i + 1}$$$.If the game does not end and it's Piggy's turn, then Piggy must choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le i \\\\le m - 1$$$, set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$\\\\min(a_i, a_{i + 1})$$$, and remove $$$a_{i + 1}$$$.Turtle wants tomaximizethe value of $$$a_1$$$ in the end, while Piggy wants tominimizethe value of $$$a_1$$$ in the end. Find the value of $$$a_1$$$ in the end if both players play optimally.You can refer to notes for further clarification.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^5$$$) — the elements of the sequence $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the value of $$$a_1$$$ in the end if both players play optimally.ExampleInput521 231 1 231 2 353 1 2 2 31010 2 5 2 7 9 2 5 10 7Output2 1 2 2 7NoteIn the first test case, initially $$$a = [1, 2]$$$. Turtle can only choose $$$i = 1$$$. Then he will set $$$a_1$$$ to $$$\\\\max(a_1, a_2) = 2$$$ and remove $$$a_2$$$. The sequence $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2]$$$. Then the length of the sequence becomes $$$1$$$, and the game will end. The value of $$$a_1$$$ is $$$2$$$, so you should output $$$2$$$.In the second test case, one of the possible game processes is as follows:Initially $$$a = [1, 1, 2]$$$.Turtle can choose $$$i = 2$$$. Then he will set $$$a_2$$$ to $$$\\\\max(a_2, a_3) = 2$$$ and remove $$$a_3$$$. The sequence $$$a$$$ will become $$$[1, 2]$$$.Piggy can choose $$$i = 1$$$. Then he will set $$$a_1$$$ to $$$\\\\min(a_1, a_2) = 1$$$ and remove $$$a_2$$$. The sequence $$$a$$$ will become $$$[1]$$$.The length of the sequence becomes $$$1$$$, so the game will end. The value of $$$a_1$$$ will be $$$1$$$ in the end.In the fourth test case, one of the possible game processes is as follows:Initially $$$a = [3, 1, 2, 2, 3]$$$.Turtle can choose $$$i = 4$$$. Then he will set $$$a_4$$$ to $$$\\\\max(a_4, a_5) = 3$$$ and remove $$$a_5$$$. The sequence $$$a$$$ will become $$$[3, 1, 2, 3]$$$.Piggy can choose $$$i = 3$$$. Then he will set $$$a_3$$$ to $$$\\\\min(a_3, a_4) = 2$$$ and remove $$$a_4$$$. The sequence $$$a$$$ will become $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$.Turtle can choose $$$i = 2$$$. Then he will set $$$a_2$$$ to $$$\\\\max(a_2, a_3) = 2$$$ and remove $$$a_3$$$. The sequence $$$a$$$ will become $$$[3, 2]$$$.Piggy can choose $$$i = 1$$$. Then he will set $$$a_1$$$ to $$$\\\\min(a_1, a_2) = 2$$$ and remove $$$a_2$$$. The sequence $$$a$$$ will become $$$[2]$$$.The length of the sequence becomes $$$1$$$, so the game will end. The value of $$$a_1$$$ will be $$$2$$$ in the end.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "c522ad4b", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
