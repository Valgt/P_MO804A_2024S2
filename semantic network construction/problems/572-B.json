The order numberihas pricepi, directiondi— buy or sell, and integerqi. This means that the participant is ready to buy or sellqistocks at pricepifor one stock. A valueqiis also known as avolumeof an order.All orders with the same pricepand directiondare merged into oneaggregatedorder with pricepand directiond. The volume of such order is a sum of volumes of the initial orders.An order book is a list of aggregated orders, the first part of which contains sell orders sorted by price in descending order, the second contains buy orders also sorted by price in descending order.An order book of depthscontainssbest aggregated orders for each direction. A buy order is better if it has higher price and a sell order is better if it has lower price. If there are less thansaggregated orders for some direction then all of them will be in the final order book.You are givennstock exhange orders. Your task is to print order book of depthsfor these orders.InputThe input starts with two positive integersnands(1 ≤n≤ 1000, 1 ≤s≤ 50), the number of orders and the book depth.Nextnlines contains a letterdi(either 'B' or 'S'), an integerpi(0 ≤pi≤ 105) and an integerqi(1 ≤qi≤ 104) — direction, price and volume respectively. The letter 'B' means buy, 'S' means sell. The price of any sell order is higher than the price of any buy order.OutputPrint no more than2slines with aggregated orders from order book of depths. The output format for orders should be the same as in input.ExamplesInput6 2B 10 3S 50 2S 40 1S 50 6B 20 4B 25 10OutputS 50 8S 40 1B 25 10B 20 4NoteDenote(x, y)an order with pricexand volumey.
