Vlad and Shapestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVladislav has a binary square grid of $$$n \\\\times n$$$ cells. A triangle or a square is drawn on the grid with symbols $$$\\\\texttt{1}$$$. As he is too busy being cool, he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.Atriangleis a shape consisting of $$$k$$$ ($$$k>1$$$) consecutive rows, where the $$$i$$$-th row has $$$2 \\\\cdot i-1$$$ consecutive characters $$$\\\\texttt{1}$$$, and the central1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: $$$k=4$$$, $$$k=3$$$. The two right pictures don't contain triangles.Asquareis a shape consisting of $$$k$$$ ($$$k>1$$$) consecutive rows, where the $$$i$$$-th row has $$$k$$$ consecutive characters $$$\\\\texttt{1}$$$, which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.Examples of two squares: $$$k=2$$$, $$$k=4$$$.For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10$$$) — the size of the grid.The next $$$n$$$ lines each contain $$$n$$$ characters $$$\\\\texttt{0}$$$ or $$$\\\\texttt{1}$$$.The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the $$$\\\\texttt{1}$$$s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle or square is greater than $$$1$$$ (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one1).OutputFor each test case, output \"SQUARE\" if all the $$$\\\\texttt{1}$$$s in the grid form a square, and \"TRIANGLE\" otherwise (without quotes).ExampleInput630000110114000000000100111021111500111000100000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111111111001111111000011111000000111000000001000003111111111OutputSQUARE TRIANGLE SQUARE TRIANGLE TRIANGLE SQUARE", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "1ec83339", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a square grid of $n \\times n$ cells, where each cell contains either a 0 or a 1.  \n\nA triangle is a shape formed by consecutive rows where the $i$-th row has $2i-1$ consecutive 1s, and the central 1s are in the same column.
