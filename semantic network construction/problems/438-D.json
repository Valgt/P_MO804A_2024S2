The Child and Sequencetime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutAt the children's day, the child came to Picks's house, and messed his house up. Picks was angry at him. A lot of important things were lost, in particular the favorite sequence of Picks.Fortunately, Picks remembers how to repair the sequence. Initially he should create an integer arraya[1],a[2], ...,a[n]. Then he should perform a sequence ofmoperations. An operation can be one of the following:Print operationl,r. Picks should write down the value of.Modulo operationl,r,x. Picks should perform assignmenta[i] =a[i]modxfor eachi(l≤i≤r).Set operationk,x. Picks should set the value ofa[k]tox(in other words perform an assignmenta[k] =x).Can you help Picks to perform the whole sequence of operations?InputThe first line of input contains two integer:n,m(1 ≤n,m≤ 105). The second line containsnintegers, separated by space:a[1],a[2], ...,a[n] (1 ≤a[i] ≤ 109)— initial value of array elements.Each of the nextmlines begins with a numbertype.Iftype= 1, there will be two integers more in the line:l,r(1 ≤l≤r≤n), which correspond the operation 1.Iftype= 2, there will be three integers more in the line:l,r,x(1 ≤l≤r≤n; 1 ≤x≤ 109), which correspond the operation 2.Iftype= 3, there will be two integers more in the line:k,x(1 ≤k≤n; 1 ≤x≤ 109), which correspond the operation 3.OutputFor each operation 1, please print a line containing the answer. Notice that the answer may exceed the 32-bit integer.ExamplesInput5 51 2 3 4 52 3 5 43 3 51 2 52 1 3 31 1 3Output85Input10 106 9 6 7 6 1 10 10 9 51 3 92 7 10 92 5 10 81 4 73 3 72 7 9 91 2 41 6 61 5 93 1 10Output49152319NoteConsider the first testcase:At first,a= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.After operation1,a= {1, 2, 3, 0, 1}.After operation2,a= {1, 2, 5, 0, 1}.At operation3,2 + 5 + 0 + 1 = 8.After operation4,a= {1, 2, 2, 0, 1}.At operation5,1 + 2 + 2 = 5.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "ef9c48d4", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a$ of length $n$.
