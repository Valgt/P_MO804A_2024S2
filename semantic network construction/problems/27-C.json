Unordered Subsequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutThe sequence is calledorderedif it is non-decreasing or non-increasing. For example, sequnces [3, 1, 1, 0] and [1, 2, 3, 100] are ordered, but the sequence [1, 3, 3, 1] is not. You are given a sequence of numbers. You are to find it's shortest subsequence which is not ordered.A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.InputThe first line of the input contains one integern(1 ≤n≤ 105). The second line containsnspace-separated integers — the given sequence. All numbers in this sequence do not exceed106by absolute value.OutputIf the given sequence does not contain any unordered subsequences, output0. Otherwise, output the lengthkof the shortest such subsequence. Then outputkintegers from the range [1..n] — indexes of the elements of this subsequence. If there are several solutions, output any of them.ExamplesInput567 499 600 42 23Output31 3 5Input31 2 3Output0Input32 3 1Output31 2 3", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "63aa4273", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of numbers.
