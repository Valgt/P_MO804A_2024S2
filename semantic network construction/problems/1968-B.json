Prefiquencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two binary strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. A binary string is a string consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.Your task is to determine the maximum possible number $$$k$$$ such that a prefix of string $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$ is a subsequence of string $$$b$$$.A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.InputThe first line consists of a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\\\\le n,m \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of string $$$a$$$ and the length of string $$$b$$$, respectively.The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.The third line of each test case contains a binary string $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$. Similarly, the sum of values $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single number — the maximum $$$k$$$, such that the first $$$k$$$ characters of $$$a$$$ form a subsequence of $$$b$$$.ExampleInput65 41001111103 31001101 311114 4101111113 5100110103 11000Output2 2 1 1 3 0NoteIn the first example, the string '$$$10$$$' is a subsequence of '$$$1\\\\color{red}11\\\\color{red}0$$$' but the string '$$$100$$$' is not. So the answer is $$$2$$$.In the fifth example, $$$a$$$='$$$100$$$', $$$b$$$='$$$1\\\\color{red}{10}1\\\\color{red}0$$$', whole string $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of string $$$b$$$. So the answer is $$$3$$$.In the sixth example, string $$$b$$$ does not contain '$$$1$$$' so the answer is $$$0$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "53f069b1", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given two binary strings,  *a* and *b*.
