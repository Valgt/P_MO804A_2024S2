Sliding Doorstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputImagine that you are the CEO of a big old-fashioned company. Unlike any modern and progressive company (such as JetBrains), your company has a dress code. That's why you have already allocated a spacious room for your employees where they can change their clothes. Moreover, you've already purchased an $$$m$$$-compartment wardrobe, so the $$$i$$$-th employee can keep his/her belongings in the $$$i$$$-th cell (of course, all compartments have equal widths).The issue has occurred: the wardrobe has sliding doors! More specifically, the wardrobe has $$$n$$$ doors (numbered from left to right) and the $$$j$$$-th door has width equal to $$$a_j$$$ wardrobe's cells. The wardrobe has single rails so that no two doors can slide past each other.Extremely schematic example of a wardrobe: $$$m=9$$$, $$$n=2$$$, $$$a_1=2$$$, $$$a_2=3$$$.The problem is as follows: sometimes to open some cells you must close some other cells (since all doors are placed on the single track). For example, if you have a $$$4$$$-compartment wardrobe (i.e. $$$m=4$$$) with $$$n=2$$$ one-cell doors (i.e. $$$a_1=a_2=1$$$) and you need to open the $$$1$$$-st and the $$$3$$$-rd cells, you have to close the $$$2$$$-nd and the $$$4$$$-th cells.As CEO, you have a complete schedule for the next $$$q$$$ days. Now you are wondering: is it possible that all employees who will come on the $$$k$$$-th day can access their cells simultaneously?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le m \\\\le 4 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of doors and compartments respectively.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le m$$$, $$$\\\\sum{a_i} \\\\le m$$$) — the corresponding widths of the doors.The third line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of days you have to process.The next $$$q$$$ lines describe schedule of each day. Each schedule is represented as an integer $$$c_k$$$ followed by $$$c_k$$$ integers $$$w_1, w_2, \\\\dots, w_{c_k}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c_k \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\\\le w_1 < w_2 < \\\\dots < w_{c_k} \\\\le m$$$) — the number of employees who will come on the $$$k$$$-th day, and their indices in ascending order.It's guaranteed that $$$\\\\sum{c_k}$$$ doesn't exceed $$$2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ answers. Each answer is \"YES\" or \"NO\" (case insensitive). Print \"YES\" if it is possible, that all employees on the corresponding day can access their compartments simultaneously.ExampleInput3 10 2 3 2 6 1 5 2 1 10 2 2 9 2 5 6 3 1 7 8 4 1 2 3 4OutputYES YES NO NO YES NO", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "91494d14", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a wardrobe with $m$ compartments and $n$ sliding doors.
