Z mod X = Ctime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$a < b < c$$$). You have to find three positive integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$z$$$ such that:$$$$$$x \\\\bmod y = a,$$$$$$ $$$$$$y \\\\bmod z = b,$$$$$$ $$$$$$z \\\\bmod x = c.$$$$$$Here $$$p \\\\bmod q$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$p$$$ by $$$q$$$. It is possible to show that for such constraints the answer always exists.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10\\\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.Each test case contains a single line with three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a < b < c \\\\le 10^8$$$).OutputFor each test case output three positive integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$z$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le x, y, z \\\\le 10^{18}$$$) such that $$$x \\\\bmod y = a$$$, $$$y \\\\bmod z = b$$$, $$$z \\\\bmod x = c$$$.You can output any correct answer.ExampleInput4 1 3 4 127 234 421 2 7 8 59 94 388Output12 11 4 1063 234 1484 25 23 8 2221 94 2609NoteIn the first test case:$$$$$$x \\\\bmod y = 12 \\\\bmod 11 = 1;$$$$$$$$$$$$y \\\\bmod z = 11 \\\\bmod 4 = 3;$$$$$$$$$$$$z \\\\bmod x = 4 \\\\bmod 12 = 4.$$$$$$", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "e99c3ab6", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given three positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ ($a < b < c$).
