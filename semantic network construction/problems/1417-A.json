He has got $$$n$$$ piles of candies, the $$$i$$$-th pile initially contains $$$a_i$$$ candies.BTherocan cast acopy-pastespell as follows:He chooses two piles $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$1 \\\\le i, j \\\\le n$$$ and $$$i \\\\ne j$$$.All candies from pile $$$i$$$ are copied into pile $$$j$$$. Formally, the operation $$$a_j := a_j + a_i$$$ is performed.BTherocan cast this spell any number of times he wants to — but unfortunately, if some pile contains strictly more than $$$k$$$ candies, he loses his magic power.
