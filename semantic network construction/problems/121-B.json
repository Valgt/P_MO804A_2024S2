Lucky Transformationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstdinoutputstdoutPetya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits4and7. For example, numbers47,744,4are lucky and5,17,467are not.Petya has a number consisting ofndigits without leading zeroes. He represented it as an array of digits without leading zeroes. Let's call itd. The numeration starts with1, starting from the most significant digit. Petya wants to perform the followingoperationktimes: find the minimumx(1 ≤x<n)such thatdx= 4anddx+ 1= 7, ifxis odd, then to assigndx=dx+ 1= 4, otherwise to assigndx=dx+ 1= 7. Note that if noxwas found, then the operation counts as completed and the array doesn't change at all.You are given the initial number as an array of digits and the numberk. Help Petya find the result of completingkoperations.InputThe first line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤n≤ 105, 0 ≤k≤ 109)— the number of digits in the number and the number of completed operations. The second line containsndigits without spaces representing the array of digitsd, starting withd1. It is guaranteed that the first digit of the number does not equal zero.OutputIn the single line print the result without spaces — the number after thekoperations are fulfilled.ExamplesInput7 44727447Output4427477Input4 24478Output4478NoteIn the first sample the number changes in the following sequence:4727447 → 4427447 → 4427477 → 4427447 → 4427477.In the second sample:4478 → 4778 → 4478.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "041e754a", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a number with $n$ digits represented as an array $d$ where $d_i$ is the $i$-th digit.
