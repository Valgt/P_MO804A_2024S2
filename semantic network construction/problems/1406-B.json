Maximum Producttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array of integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$. Find the maximum possible value of $$$a_ia_ja_ka_la_t$$$ among all five indices $$$(i, j, k, l, t)$$$ ($$$i<j<k<l<t$$$).InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\\\le t\\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$5\\\\le n\\\\le 10^5$$$) — the size of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$-3\\\\times 10^3\\\\le a_i\\\\le 3\\\\times 10^3$$$) — given array.It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\\\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.ExampleInput4 5 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 6 -1 -2 -3 1 2 -1 6 -1 0 0 0 -1 -1 6 -9 -7 -5 -3 -2 1Output-120 12 0 945NoteIn the first test case, choosing $$$a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5$$$ is a best choice: $$$(-1)\\\\cdot (-2) \\\\cdot (-3)\\\\cdot (-4)\\\\cdot (-5)=-120$$$.In the second test case, choosing $$$a_1,a_2,a_3,a_5,a_6$$$ is a best choice: $$$(-1)\\\\cdot (-2) \\\\cdot (-3)\\\\cdot 2\\\\cdot (-1)=12$$$.In the third test case, choosing $$$a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5$$$ is a best choice: $$$(-1)\\\\cdot 0\\\\cdot 0\\\\cdot 0\\\\cdot (-1)=0$$$.In the fourth test case, choosing $$$a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6$$$ is a best choice: $$$(-9)\\\\cdot (-7) \\\\cdot (-5)\\\\cdot (-3)\\\\cdot 1=945$$$.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "2603081c", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given an array of integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
