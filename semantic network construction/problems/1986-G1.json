Permutation Problem (Simple Version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test128 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is a simple version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\\\leq 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$n$$$ for all sets of input data does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.You are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Calculate the number of index pairs $$$1 \\\\leq i < j \\\\leq n$$$ such that $$$p_i \\\\cdot p_j$$$ is divisible by $$$i \\\\cdot j$$$ without remainder.A permutation is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once. For example, $$$[1]$$$, $$$[3,5,2,1,4]$$$, $$$[1,3,2]$$$ are permutations, while $$$[2,3,2]$$$, $$$[4,3,1]$$$, $$$[0]$$$ are not.InputEach test consists of multiple sets of input data. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of sets of input data. Then follows their description.The first line of each set of input data contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$.The second line of each set of input data contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq p_i \\\\leq n$$$) — the permutation $$$p$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all sets of input data does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each set of input data, output the number of index pairs $$$1 \\\\leq i < j \\\\leq n$$$ such that $$$p_i \\\\cdot p_j$$$ is divisible by $$$i \\\\cdot j$$$ without remainder.ExampleInput61121 232 3 152 4 1 3 5128 9 7 12 1 10 6 3 2 4 11 5151 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 3 9 15 5 7 11 13Output0 1 1 3 9 3NoteIn the first set of input data, there are no index pairs, as the size of the permutation is $$$1$$$.In the second set of input data, there is one index pair $$$(1, 2)$$$ and it is valid.In the third set of input data, the index pair $$$(1, 2)$$$ is valid.In the fourth set of input data, the index pairs $$$(1, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 5)$$$, and $$$(2, 5)$$$ are valid.", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "33652d1f", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "You are given a sequence of $n$ distinct numbers called a permutation.
