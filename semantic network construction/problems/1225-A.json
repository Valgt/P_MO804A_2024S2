Forgetting Thingstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKolya is very absent-minded. Today his math teacher asked him to solve a simple problem with the equation $$$a + 1 = b$$$ with positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, but Kolya forgot the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. He does, however, remember that the first (leftmost) digit of $$$a$$$ was $$$d_a$$$, and the first (leftmost) digit of $$$b$$$ was $$$d_b$$$.Can you reconstruct any equation $$$a + 1 = b$$$ that satisfies this property? It may be possible that Kolya misremembers the digits, and there is no suitable equation, in which case report so.InputThe only line contains two space-separated digits $$$d_a$$$ and $$$d_b$$$ ($$$1 \\\\leq d_a, d_b \\\\leq 9$$$).OutputIf there is no equation $$$a + 1 = b$$$ with positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that the first digit of $$$a$$$ is $$$d_a$$$, and the first digit of $$$b$$$ is $$$d_b$$$, print a single number $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, print any suitable $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ thatbothare positive and do not exceed $$$10^9$$$. It is guaranteed that if a solution exists, there also exists a solution with both numbers not exceeding $$$10^9$$$.ExamplesInput1 2Output199 200Input4 4Output412 413Input5 7Output-1Input6 2Output-1", "source": "CF", "vjudge": false, "processed": [{"prompt_md5": "5e9d3f7e", "template_md5": "35d339e4", "result": "Given two digits $d_a$ and $d_b$ (where $1 \\le d_a, d_b \\le 9$), find two positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that:\n\n* The first digit of $a$ is $d_a$.\n* The first digit of $b$ is $d_b$.\n* $a + 1 = b$\n\nIf no such integers exist, output -1.
